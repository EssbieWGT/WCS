Wildlife officer Mark Gritzer told club member Jon Mikesell that he had been watching Mikesell and his guests for several days, using binoculars and wearing camouflage to conceal himself in the club’s 1,100 acre swath of Clearfield County woods.
Gritzer left without giving Mikesell a ticket, but Mikesell was rattled because neither he nor any of the club’s other members had given the officer permission to enter the private club’s posted and gated property. 
Pennsylvania laws, however, permit wildlife officers to search private lands without a warrant under a century-old U.S. Supreme Court decision. An attorney for Pitch Pine and the nearby 4,400-acre Punxsutawny Hunting Club said Wednesday that’s what Gritzer and other wildlife officers had done at least 22 times, including the installation of surveillance cameras.
“The clubs are private places, places where members go to enjoy nature without being watched, to have private conversations, without being listened to, to hunt without worrying that strangers might be hiding in the bushes,” Joshua Windham, of the conservative public interest law firm Institute for Justice, said.
The clubs sued the Pennsylvania Game Commission and Gritzer in Commonwealth Court, asking the court to find three state laws allowing the warrantless searches unconstitutional. The court ruled against them in 2023 and they appealed to the state’s highest court. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
In an argument before the Pennsylvania Supreme Court on Wednesday, Windham argued the so-called Open Fields Doctrine created in the 1924 high court decision is at odds with the state constitution. He asked the court to reverse its own 2007 decision adopting the doctrine and invalidate the laws the decision upheld.
Courts across the nation have relied on the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision finding that the Fourth Amendment’s prohibition on warrantless searches of “persons, houses, papers, and effects” does not apply to open land not immediately surrounding a home. According to a study by the Institute for Justice, 90% of land in Pennsylvania is subject to warrantless searches, Windham told the Capital-Star.
Seven states have rejected the Open Fields Doctrine, most recently with the Tennessee Supreme Court finding last summer that warrantless searches by wildlife officials violated that state’s constitution.
Article 1 Section 8 of the Pennsylvania Constitution, which roughly corresponds to the Fourth Amendment, uses different language, guaranteeing people security in their “persons, houses, papers and possessions.”
“Everywhere you look … you find Pennsylvanians and others using the word possessions to describe private land,” Windham said. “William Penn’s Charter, the original charter that granted him the land that became this commonwealth, granted him the right to quote, ‘possess and enjoy the land.’”
Deputy state Attorney General Anthony Kovalchick argued on behalf of the game commission and Gritzer that reversing its own decision on the Open Fields Doctrine would require the state Supreme Court to jettison a century’s worth of legal precedent.
Justice David Wecht said the court takes the issue of precedent seriously, but challenged Kovalchick to name another area of law where people have no expectation of privacy.

“I mean, our cases make clear that even in a hotel room that you’re renting for a night or a rental car or a visit to another person’s house, you at least get a chance to show an expectation of privacy,” Wecht said.
Kovalchick replied that the Pennsylvania Constitution and the Fourth Amendment both provide for a “reasonable expectation of privacy” and reasonable people wouldn’t expect the woods where they hunt to be private.
He added that trespassing laws keeps out members of the public, but the fact that a game warden can enter a property to investigate hunting violations doesn’t mean that the owner has no privacy. 
The justices asked Kovalchick about Gritzer’s placement of cameras on the clubs’ properties. He replied that it was done in response to allegations that members were illegally feeding elk and that no warrant was required to do so.
“Your answer is, ‘Well, the law doesn’t require it,’” Wecht said. “And a response from us might be, Well, why shouldn’t the law require that?’” 
Kovalchick said the court should use the same reading of the constitution as it did inits 2007 decision on this issue, that the term “possessions” does not apply as broadly as the hunting clubs assert.
“If the framers wanted the word possessions to mean every single thing that is owned, including real property, it would have most likely used other phrases like private property,” Kovalchick said.
Justice Kevin Brobson noted other parts of the state constitution refer to the right to possess land. “I’m hard pressed to say that in Article One, Section One, they talked about land as a possession, but in Article One, Section Eight, they didn’t,” Brobson said.
Wecht proposed a hypothetical situation in which a person built a swimming pool in the middle of a heavily wooded property with a wall around it and used it to go skinny dipping. 
“Mr. Greitzer could walk on and put up a camera … the person enjoying that pool cannot even attempt to show any expectation of privacy. How does that square with the Pennsylvania Constitution?” Wecht asked.
“A reasonable person would not believe that going out and doing things that you would only do in the home are reasonable to go out and do in the woods,” Kovalchick replied.

Josh Stein's State of the State address on March 12, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Lawmakers in the North Carolina legislature advanced a pair of bills Wednesday that aim to wipe diversity, equity and inclusion efforts from government and college campuses.
House Bill 171 bans local and state governments from maintaining DEI offices and programs, considering the measures while awarding contracts, and conducting DEI trainings.
And Senate Bill 558 defines a range of “discriminatory practices” and “divisive concepts” on college campuses, expanding on a DEI ban already put in place by the UNC System’s Board of Governors.
Both bills passed out of their respective chambers Wednesday on party-line votes. They’ll head across the building for further consideration.
The pair of bills come amid a push from both the Trump administration and Republican state legislatures to eliminate diversity and equity practices from all corners of the public sector.
A third North Carolina proposal moving through the legislature also bans DEI in K-12 schools. House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has said the trio of proposals could eventually be bundled into one larger bill down the line, if GOP leadership opts to do so.
Ban on state and local governments
A state worker who violates the proposal to ban DEI in state agencies could face a civil lawsuit, penalties of up to thousands of dollars and termination. Local government employees, too, would be subject to legal action, penalties and firing.
The bill was changed during committee negotiations, removing language that would have also applied the ban on DEI to “non-state entities” that receive public funds.
Its Republican sponsors also removed criminal penalties from the bill, and excluded charter and private schools from being impacted.
Democratic opponents have argued that there is almost nothing in current state government that would qualify as “DEI,” but that the bill could nonetheless hurt recruiting and retaining workers in a state that has struggled to fill vacancies.
It would take effect on Dec. 1.
Ban on college campuses
Last year, the UNC System Board of Governors voted to repeal its DEI policy, replacing it with a statement of “principled neutrality.” Under the bill approved by the Senate on Wednesday, the board — as well as the governing body for state community colleges — would have to approve another new policy to comply.
The bill is almost identical to a similar bill applying to K-12 schools. It outlines a list of “divisive concepts” and “discriminatory practices” that campuses are banned from endorsing or affirming. That includes treating a person differently “solely to advantage or disadvantage that individual.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/IMG_0870-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 20:07:03.728075

St. Augustine Republican Sen. Tom Leek sponsored the bill, SB 466, which would establish a board of directors to oversee construction and operation of the museum.
The governor, Senate president, and House speaker would each appoint three board members. The legislative leaders would also appoint two lawmakers from each chamber.
Although the upper chamber’s vote brings the museum closer to the finish line, the House version of the bill hasn’t been heard as the time to move forward policy in this year’s session dwindles. However, the Senate and House budgets both include a $1 million appropriation for the museum.
“Understanding Black history is crucial because it’s an integral part of American history, a beautiful part of Florida history,” said St. Petersburg Democratic Sen. Darryl Rouson, a co-sponsor of the bill. “It illuminates the struggles and triumphs of a people who have significantly contributed to the shaping of not only the nation, but of the state. Importantly, it’s contributed to the very uniqueness of the state of Florida.”
The vote comes two years after the Legislature created a task force to recommend a location for the museum, a design, a business plan, and its educational content. However, the museum’s potential site became the task force’s focus over its 10 meetings as St. Johns County and Eatonville in Orange County emerged as the leading locations.
The late Orlando Democratic Sen. Geraldine Thompson, who chaired the task force, wanted the museum in Eatinville, one of the first self-governing Black municipalities in the country.
Florida Memorial University agreed to lease 17 acres of land for the museum, about a 10-minute drive outside of St. Augustine.
St. Johns County was the site of Florida’s first Black settlement (Fort Mose) in 1738, when the Spanish still colonized the region.

All present Democrats voted against it and 12 Republicans joined them despite arguments from Rep. Tom Millett, R-Marion, that the bill made practical and political sense.
The bill came out of the Senate Special Committee on Judicial Oversight and Reform, part of swath of priority legislation this year for Republicans.
With support from sponsor Sen. Barry Usher, R-Billings, the House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously to amend Senate Bill 49 to postpone the date it would take effect.
Rep. Tom France, D-Missoula, suggested the amendment would address concerns the legislation intends to protect Attorney General Austin Knudsen, who is facing disciplinary charges. An original draft of the bill only applied to the attorney general.
On the House floor Monday, Millett pointed to a couple examples where he believed the bill would be helpful, including the case against Knudsen.
“This is a freedom of speech issue and will allow our constitutional officers and members of the legislature who just happen to be lawyers from being persecuted for their speech by the lawyer disciplinary system,” Millett said.
Currently, the attorney general is “hobbled” from defending the legislature, as evidenced by the disciplinary case underway, Millett said.
However, Millett also said Gov. Greg Gianforte “railed against the Supreme Court” in his state of the state address.
The governor did so without fear he would be “dragged in front of the ODC,” the Office for Disciplinary Counsel — but Millett said that wouldn’t be true if Gianforte also was a lawyer.
The Office for Disciplinary Counsel handles discipline against members of the bar.
“If this isn’t a chilling effect on speech, I don’t know what is,” Millett said.
Lawyers are sworn to abide by rules of professional conduct, which include respect for the legal system.
In his vehement defense of the legislature during a previous dispute, Knudsen at one point said he did not recognize the court’s order as binding and would not follow it.
The Office for Disciplinary Counsel filed a complaint alleging violations, and the Commission on Practice  recommended the Montana Supreme Court temporarily suspend Knudsen.
The case is pending.
In response to ethics charges by the ODC, Knudsen has said he could have phrased things differently. He also recently described the disciplinary process as a “kangaroo court” to KGVO.
To protect both speech and the separation of powers, Millett said the bill would create a small carveout for Constitutional officers, also the superintendent of public schools, auditor, lieutenant governor and secretary of state.
If it had passed, the bill would have protected members of the legislature as well.
On the floor during a short debate, Rep. Ed Stafman, D-Bozeman, argued against it. He said he believes immunity from accountability should be granted only “very, very sparingly,” but the bill provides broad immunity.
“The bill would erode accountability, encourage abuse of power, undermine the rule of law, (and) reduce public trust in government,” Stafman said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/GettyImages-1488675709-1024x662.jpg,,,2025-04-09 20:07:03.728075

(Getty Images)As President Donald Trump signed several executive orders this week meant to bolster America’s struggling coal industry, miners in Central Appalachia who are responsible for digging up that coal are being left with fewer resources to protect them thanks to federal policies and cuts. 
On Tuesday, the federal Mine Health and Safety Administration announced that the implementation of an industry rule to limit miners’ exposure to dangerous silica dust — a leading cause of black lung disease — was being delayed until August. The rule, finalized last year, was set to go into effect for coal mines on April 14 and would have cut exposure limits for silica dust in half.
MSHA’s announcement of the rule’s delayed implementation came days after a federal judge, in response to a request from industry groups led by the National Stone, Sand and Gravel Administration, issued a temporary stay against it.
It also comes as the federal government — through the new Department of Government Efficiency — is making cuts to agencies across the region that play instrumental roles in protecting coal miners from disease and accidents.
Under the Trump Administration, DOGE has already targeted about three dozen MSHA offices nationwide for closure. Those offices employ mine inspectors whose jobs are to ensure that coal mine operators are meeting industry standards known to lower the risks of accidents and injuries for coal miners. 
According to an analysis from the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, the offices slated for closure performed more than 16,600 safety and health inspections — with more than 230 of those done in West Virginia — between February 2024 and 2025.
Following the cuts, it’s unclear how many of those mine inspections will continue to occur.
And last week, DOGE’s cuts in the name of federal cost savings hit the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, an agency that plays a crucial role in detecting black lung among the nation’s coal miners. There, more than 200 jobs were eliminated at the institute’s Morgantown location.
In MSHA’s public notice posted earlier this week, the agency said that the “unforeseen NIOSH restructuring” was a direct driver of the agency’s decision to delay implementation of the rule.
Until those cuts, Noemi Hall worked as an epidemiologist in NIOSH’s Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program. In her work, Hall and her colleagues were responsible for screening coal miners for black lung disease, often through a mobile clinic that traveled between coal mines and coal communities for easy access.
Those free screenings, Hall said, were crucial for the early detection of black lung, a critical step that can help prevent the disease from developing into its most severe and debilitating form.
“What really happened is the Coal Workers Health Surveillance Program, because of the [reduction in force] at NIOSH, well it’s been completely eliminated,” Hall said. “It can no longer serve the functions it needs to serve. Coal miners are more vulnerable now, that’s the truth of it.”
Workers at the CWHSP didn’t just perform the screenings — the agency was also tasked with evaluating coal miners’ results and, when necessary, providing documentation that allowed coal miners to exercise their rights to be transferred to a different, less dusty part of a coal mine if they showed signs of black lung.
Since the NIOSH cuts, however, coal miners haven’t been able to access their X-rays or results from spirometry tests. And since the CWHSP no longer exists, there’s no one to evaluate those results and alert coal miners of their right to transfer.
“Coal miners have lost an essential right that they fought for,” Hall said. “To exercise that right, they need to have the X-ray reviewed by NIOSH and that function is no longer able to occur.”
‘We don’t want to turn back the clock on black lung’
Trump’s four executive orders this week honed in on four policies that he says will boost production of “beautiful, clean coal:” ending a moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining activities, removing environmental regulations that Trump said slowed approvals for new mining projects, prioritizing grid security and reliability and blocking states from enforcing their own, stricter regulations on coal mining.
But while the Trump administration is demanding more coal be mined in America with fewer protections for the workers, rates of black lung disease are already on the rise, according to a body of research.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
And the resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before. This is due to miners, because of a lack of easily accessible coal, being forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone than their predecessors in order to reach what little coal remains.
The proposed silica dust rule would be the first of its kind to limit coal miners’ exposure to the dangerous dust. Other industries, through the Occupational Health and Safety Administration, have had the same protections in place for years based on decades of research showing the clear harm of inhaling silica dust. 
The rule was celebrated by advocates and workers within the coal industry. Former federal officials said that, once implemented, the rule could potentially save thousands of lives by cutting exposure limits in half for workers on an eight hour shift.
But now, with the rule in question and a dearth of workers who are certified to screen and diagnose black lung in Central Appalachia, advocates worry that black lung is going to continue to harm and kill the region’s miners. There is no cure for black lung, only disease management.
“Silica dust is killing miners and the only way to help curb the devastation of black lung disease is to start enforcing this rule,” said Rebecca Shelton, Director of Policy at Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center. “Instead, the Trump administration just gutted NIOSH, an institution that provided services that were essential to the enforcement of this rule. Rather than recognizing its mistake and working to reestablish NIOSH, the administration is doubling down on eliminating protections for miners and delaying this rule.”
Hall said she was incredibly proud of the work she was able to do through NIOSH. But now, she said, it’s hard for her to think about what comes next for the coal miners she’s worked with and those who will eventually enter the industry.
“What we do at NIOSH — all the research, the screenings, everything we do — it’s done for the benefit of the coal miners,” Hall said. “Our goal is to help protect coal miners, to make sure they can work safely and be protected. That’s good for the nation and without [protections] I don’t know where we go; we don’t want to turn back the clock on black lung.”
‘I want to get back to work’
After Trump announced his coal industry executive orders on Tuesday, West Virginia’s congressional delegation was quick to celebrate what they saw as wins for the state’s struggling coal economy.
“These executive orders are welcome news for our miners and the entire industry, and I am glad we have a president that recognizes the need to support them,” said Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va.
Sen. Jim Justice, R-W.Va. — whose family operates multiple coal mines that have been subject to dozens of fines due to health and safety violations — said he was “proud” to stand with Trump in ensuring that “West Virginia can continue to lead the way in energy production for generations to come.”
And Rep. Carol Miller, R-W.Va., said the orders will help create jobs and improve the state’s economy.
“No one works harder than a West Virginia coal miner, and I thank President Trump for his commitment to the coal industry and West Virginia,” Miller said.
Meanwhile, no statements have come from the delegation regarding the delay of the silica rule or the potential vulnerability of West Virginia’s coal miners as they are being asked to mine more coal.
The strongest statement has come from Capito, who told reporters last week that she had “strong disagreements” with DOGE’s cuts in the state, specifically at NIOSH. She said she planned to talk to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the cuts, but no further announcements on the subject have been made.
Last year, when House Republicans attempted to halt the implementation of the silica rule by blocking funding for it, Capito — who sits on the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations — declined to comment on the proposed legislation or the rule.
And none of the state’s congressional delegation has signed on to support the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act, which would increase inspections at mines, enhance enforcement measures and penalties, modernize safety standards and levy more rights for coal miners.
For Hall, it’s difficult to watch what the government is doing — or, moreso, not doing — for the region’s coal miners. But overall, she said, she knows good people are in the government. She considers herself and all of her colleagues who worked at the CWHSP as part of that government.
Now, she said, she wants to ensure people know what the real impact of these policy decisions will be.
“I know the government is full of people who care very deeply about the American people. That’s what I felt I was doing, and I would love to have the opportunity to continue to do that — to help my neighbors, help coal miners,” Hall said. “I don’t want what’s happening to be accepted. I don’t want it to be what I did at NIOSH or what I used to do there. We need to continue doing this work, and I want to get back to work.”

(Photo by Mike Clark for the Daily Montanan)Montana will soon have a new holiday on the books, after the House approved of Senate Bill 224 to add Indigenous Peoples’ Day to the list of legal state holidays.
The House on Wednesday passed the bill 87-12, establishing the holiday to be celebrated on the second Monday of October, in addition to recognizing Columbus Day the same day.
“The day has morphed into something to recognize everyone. Always going to be a strong presence of Montana Indians, but this effort is trying to incorporate and include everyone,” said Rep. Tyson Running Wolf, D-Browning, who carried the bill in the House. “It’s a day that celebrates the ancestral lineage of all Montanans, again, all Montanans.
“And it’s a day that is shaped and molded by each community and how that community wants to celebrate each other. So this bill gets away from eliminating a holiday and simply gives Montanans the option to celebrate what they prefer on the second Monday in October.”
Attempts to recognize Indigenous Peoples’ Day in previous sessions were unsuccessful, partially due to some versions of legislation eliminating Columbus Day completely. The current version of the bill passed the Senate in February with just three opponents.
The co-celebration of the two holidays in October is done in Rhode Island, Nebraska and Alabama, while four states and Washington, D.C., have established Indigenous Peoples’ Day as a standalone state holiday.
Running Wolf said in the committee hearing many Montanans came and shared stories about their backgrounds — some Native, some from other parts of the world. One man with Irish heritage came in and spoke the Irish language, sharing its meaning to his own history.
“And it was beautiful. And we celebrated it all together,” Running Wolf said. “… What we heard in the hearing is that people want to learn about each other and the rich heritage that so many Montanans bring to Montana.”
During floor debate, Rep. Ed Byrne, R-Bigfork, introduced an amendment to change the order of holidays in the bill, to make Columbus Day listed first to maintain “its precedence of establishment.”
Running Wolf said his biggest concern was that it would delay the process by sending the bill back to the Senate and cost more taxpayer money. The amendment failed to pass 27-70.
“Indigenous Peoples’ Day is a testament to our shared history values as Montanans, it celebrates the collaborative efforts to the stewards of our land, educates us about the profound knowledge and contributions of all Montana communities, and highlights our shared strength and responsibility,” Running Wolf said. “By honoring this day we take pride in our past, foster a deep understanding of all Indigenous entities and work together protect our cherish holiday heritage for future generations.”

(Photo via USCG)The Florida Senate approved an institute at Florida State University to research the insurance market during a time when hurricanes have battered the state and insurance regulators have been questioned under oath by the House. 
Sen. Jay Trumbull, a Panhandle Republican, is the sponsor for SB 114, a bill that would create the Center for Excellence in Insurance and Risk Management at Florida State University. 
“Going back 20-plus years ago, Florida looked at insurance very differently pre-Andrew,” Trumbull said in March during the bill’s first committee stop. “Post-Andrew, we started to take a much different look at how we needed to plan forward and operate.”
Hurricane Andrew inflicted an estimated $26 billion in damage in 1992 when it hit Miami-Dade County. More than 63,500 homes were destroyed and 124,000 were damaged while 65 people were killed, the Tampa Bay Times reported. 
The bill would moves the Hurricane Loss Projection Model from Florida International University to FSU. 
Trumbull said the bill is meant to make the state’s measurement and management of insurance more “robust.” It would help legislators in developing and evaluating “evidence-based policy options and making recommendations related to insurance and risk management,” according to the bill text. 
Florida lawmakers have convened for special sessions regarding insurance, developed stricter building codes, and run election campaigns based on insurance issues.
The center would address all lines of insurance and be responsible for researching inquiries from the House, Senate, or Office of Insurance Regulation.  
Insurance regulators were questioned by the House Insurance & Banking Subcommittee earlier this session following a Tampa Bay Times story detailing how insurance companies claimed financial ruin while sending billions to affiliated companies. 
While FIU would lose the loss model, Trumbull said, it is owned by the Office of Insurance Regulation, not the university. The center would be located in the FSU College of Business and Department of Risk Management. 
FSU has a Risk Management and Insurance Center that studies the market, housing prices, homeowners’ insurance, and catastrophe risk.
The bill passed both its committee assignments in the Senate unanimously. Its companion in the House, HB 1097, has been passed by three committees and now is before the Commerce Committee.

Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, speaks on the Senate floor on April 9, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill that sought to reduce penalties for possessing small amounts marijuana in North Dakota failed in the Senate Wednesday on a 33-13 vote.
House Bill 1596 would have reduced the penalty for possessing less than a half ounce of marijuana from a criminal infraction to a noncriminal citation, similar to a speeding ticket, and a $150 fine. 
The bill also spells out other reduced penalties for other low-level marijuana possession offenses, varying based on the amount and the age of the person. Possessing 500 grams of marijuana or more would remain a Class A misdemeanor under the bill.
Court hearings for low-level offenses would not be required, but a person could still choose to appear in court. Bill sponsor Liz Conmy, D-Fargo, previously said the proposal aimed to reduce the amount of time judges and attorneys spend on minor marijuana possession offenses, which often result in a $150 fine but can require three court appearances.
Low-level marijuana offenders could pay a fine, skip court, under North Dakota bill

Sen. Janne Myrdal, R-Edinburg, voted against the bill and said law enforcement agencies were also opposed to the measure. She pointed to the defeat of recreational marijuana ballot measures and said the bill would go against the people’s wishes.
In November, 53% of North Dakota voters opposed a ballot initiative that sought to legalize recreational marijuana for adults and create a framework for a legal cannabis industry. It was the third such effort to fail in six years.
Sen. Diane Larson, R-Bismarck, questioned why the bill had no escalating penalties for repeat violations for marijuana possession, like the state has included for other types of crimes.
“I’ve been concerned this session at the number of times we talk about the prison being full, or the courts being clogged, and so the way we’re addressing it is to lessen crime?” Larson said. “I feel that we have criminal offenses on the books for a reason and the people have voted on this and wanted to keep this on the books.”
Sen. Ryan Braunberger, D-Fargo, was among those who voted in favor of the measure.
“Neighboring states are starting to legalize it more and more, so smaller amounts of possession are going to get more prevalent,” Braunberger said. 
State’s attorneys from Cass County and Stark County both submitted testimony in favor of the bill. Both counties border states where recreational marijuana is legal.
Braunberger said he expects the issue to remain contentious going forward.
“I think it’s only a matter of time when the federal (government) is going to decriminalize it all together,” he said. 
The bill passed the House in February on a 76-17 vote.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill raising the public vote threshold to 60% to approve constitutional ballot measures in North Dakota passed the Senate Wednesday on a 33-13 vote.
House Resolution 3003, sponsored by Rep. Robin Weisz, R-Hurdsfield, would require a 60% threshold to pass both constitutional ballot petitions initiated by the people and constitutional resolutions from the Legislature.
“It’s quite likely that we all agree that it should be possible to change our state’s foundational document, however it should be more difficult than it currently is,” said Sen. Jeff Barta, R-Grand Forks, who voted in favor of the resolution.
Barta said the North Dakota Constitution has been amended 167 times compared to the U.S. Constitution, which has been amended 27 times with stricter rules that include approval from three-quarters of all 50 states.
Sen. Dick Dever, R-Bismarck, voted in favor of the bill and said North Dakota voters will still have the final say on the new potential threshold at the ballot box. He added he believes there is a segment of the population that has an agenda to sow division against lawmakers in state government to further an agenda of dissatisfaction.
“I think we should preserve the republic rather than attacking it,” Dever said.
Sen. Jeff Magrum, R- Hazelton, voted against the resolution and warned lawmakers that not only would it become harder to pass constitutional measures in the future, but it would be harder to change parts of the constitution already in place.
Term limits changes revived for possible statewide vote in North Dakota

“We passed a resolution that is intending to change the constitution on term limits, so when you raise the threshold, you are making it harder to change things that were passed that you think weren’t good,” Magrum said.
Sen. Sean Cleary, R-Bismarck, voted against the bill and told lawmakers the current ballot petition process serves as an important check on the Legislature.
“Every time the state Legislature has proposed limiting the powers reserved to the people, the voters have wisely rejected that,” Cleary said. 
Twenty-three pieces of testimony were submitted on the resolution with all but three opposed to  raising the threshold. The League of Women Voters of North Dakota was among the opponents, pointing out the defeat last November of Measure 2, which contained several proposed changes to the constitutional ballot measure process.
“For over 100 years, North Dakotans have used direct democracy to shape state policy,” Barbara Headrick, League of Women Voters of North Dakota president, said in a statement Wednesday. “With the passage of House Concurrent Resolution 3003, the North Dakota Legislature is attempting again to weaken the power of the people to amend our state constitution. … They need to stop trying to limit the voice of the people in the governance of our state.”
The resolution passed the House in January on a 65-28 vote.
If approved by the Secretary of State’s Office, the resolution will be put to the voters during the 2026 general election.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Hundreds of Washington state workers descended on the Capitol on Wednesday, staging a sit-in outside the governor’s office and a march to the gates of the executive mansion to protest potential furloughs amid a massive budget shortfall.
Workers from the Washington Federation of State Employees and other local unions pushed for a so-called wealth tax rather than cutting their earnings or state programs to fill the estimated $16 billion budget hole. Gov. Bob Ferguson has shunned the revenue idea as an untested concept that will attract court challenges.
Protesting workers made two passes to Ferguson’s office. The first time they encountered a closed door and chanted from outside for the governor to meet with them. A short time later, they returned and a small crowd, including federation president Mike Yestramski, got inside but did not meet with the governor.
“One of his people came out and said we’ll let him know you were here,” Yestramski said. “I think we made our message clear.”
Ferguson was not on campus Wednesday. He was working in Seattle.

Brionna Aho, Ferguson’s communications director, said in an email, “We value our state employees. Our team has been in regular and close communication with WFSE at multiple levels, including numerous calls and meetings with our senior leadership.”
As part of his suite of proposed budget cuts, Ferguson has floated two years of one-day-per-month furloughs for state workers. Potential budget saving options also include closing state facilities, like reentry centers for people leaving prison and residential care facilities for people with developmental disabilities.
Senate Democrats’ operating budget plan, unveiled last month, includes 13 unpaid furlough days in the fiscal year starting July 1. House Democrats avoid furloughs entirely.
The governor and Democratic lawmakers both look to honor collective bargaining agreements with 5% wage increases over the next two years for state employees. However, state workers say the effect of the furloughs will eat up most of the negotiated pay hikes.
Workers began Wednesday with an hour-long rally on the Capitol grounds, next to Tivoli Fountain, in which labor leaders and legislators repeatedly blasted the first-term governor for not standing behind them after public sector unions provided their full-throated support for him in the 2024 election.
Speakers talked of the chaos that could ensue if thousands of state workers staged a one-day walkout in protest of the furlough ideas.
 “Governor Ferguson, the choice is yours. We gave you your job. We can take it from you too,” said Milö Nicholas, a public health worker and vice president of Local 443 that represents state employees in Lewis, Mason and Thurston counties.
Rep. Brianna Thomas, D-Seattle, said the governor seemed to have forgotten who helped get him elected. She vowed to stand strong against balancing the budgets on the backs of the workers.
“Bob may be a chessmaster, but he sure as s**t ain’t beating me in a street fight,” she said.
Yestramski took the stage last at the outdoor rally. He has called Ferguson a “pseudo Democrat” and a “ratfink.”
“I heard the governor might be a little upset with us. He doesn’t like being called out,” Yestramski said. “You know what we don’t like? Being scammed.”
Yestramski said he had not met with Ferguson since he took office. 
He called on Ferguson to “look us in the eye and tell us why you are prioritizing billionaires over the working people of this state. He’s too busy to meet with us. We’ve all got time right now,” Yestramski told the cheering crowd as it then headed to the Capitol.
Inside the rotunda, their booming chants “No cuts, no furloughs, tax, tax the rich” could be heard in the House and Senate chambers where lawmakers were voting on legislation. 
Democrats from the two chambers are now negotiating a final budget plan. 
Democratic legislative leaders said Wednesday they plan to release new ideas for raising revenue next week in line with the governor’s wishes. 
“My members and I in the House are all going to get pushed to our limit in a year like this. Every member of the Senate is going to get pushed to their limit in a year like this, and so is the governor,” House Speaker Laurie Jinkins, D-Tacoma, told reporters. “The point that we’re trying to get to is probably a somewhat narrow path.”

Alex Andrade, a Republican representing parts of Escambia and Santa Rosa counties, speaks to reporters on April 9, 2025. (Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A state-contracted Medicaid managed care plan paid $10 million to the Hope Florida Foundation, a direct-service organization affiliated with First Lady Casey DeSantis, the head of the state’s largest health care agency told legislators Wednesday.
Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) Secretary Shevaun Harris said a $10 million payment to the Hope Florida Foundation was part of a larger $67 million agreement the agency signed with Centene Health Plan, one of several managed care plans the state contracts with to provide health services to the poor, elderly, and disabled. The other $57 million went to the agency.
The $10 million payment was not immediately disclosed to the Legislature. Instead, the House discovered its existence from the October minutes from a Hope Florida Foundation meeting. Agency officials discussed the payment under questioning from members of the House Health Care Budget Subcommittee.
The scrutiny of Hope Florida comes amid speculation that Casey DeSantis may run for governor. Gov. Ron DeSantis has touted Hope Florida and when asked about the foundation recently, he asserted that a reporter was helping with a “smear” of the program.
Harris was secretary of the Department of Children and Families, not AHCA, when the agreement was reached. 
She told House Health Care Budget Subcommittee Chairman Alex Andrade that Centene approached the state about improper reimbursements. 
According to the Centene website, the company operates in Florida under the brands Sunshine Health, Wellcare, AmBetter Health, and the Children’s Medical Services Health Plan, which serves medically complex children.
She said an agreement had been reached whereby Centene returned the overpayments to the state. Harris said the money went into state trust funds and was properly accounted for.
Andrade then asked Harris how $10 million could “walk from AHCA’s bank account to Hope Florida’s DSO [direct service organization] last October?”
Harris replied: “Those funds were never given to the state. They were a direct contribution made from Centene to the foundation.”
Andrade, an attorney, continued to press, asking Harris whether AHCA required Centene as part of the settlement to make a separate $10 million payment outside the state’s accounting system.
Harris said she’s not an attorney and wasn’t involved in the settlement discussions.
“However, I  know a lot of lawyers were involved in the drafting of the settlement agreement and I have to believe that all T’s were crossed and I’s dotted to ensure the authority was there,” she said.
Centene did not immediately respond to Florida Phoenix’s request for comment.
‘Stunning to me’
The Florida Phoenix obtained a copy of the agreement, signed by former AHCA Secretary Jason Weida (now Gov. DeSantis’ chief of staff), Chief Deputy Attorney General John Guard, Insurance Commissioner Michael Yaworksi, Department of Health Chief of Staff Cassandra Pasley, and Centene Corp. Executive Vice President, Secretary, and General Counsel Christopher A. Koster.
Andrade told reporters after the meeting that he was disappointed in some of Harris’ responses.
“To act as if this wasn’t state funds was stunning to me,” he said. 
“The entitlement that it takes to act as if that this settlement was not a settlement related to the over-expense of state funds kind of shocks me. I don’t know what we can do but, obviously, at the very least we need more accountability on what that $10 million is being used for and how on earth AHCA felt justified in transferring those funds to a separate different agency.”
The reveal follows news reports about the Hope Florida Foundation, launched by First Lady DeSantis.
It is one of several financial matters involving AHCA that the subcommittee is examining.
The panel last month criticized overspending and financial mismanagement by AHCA, with a document showing the agency could face upward of a $965 million deficit. The Legislature thought it had addressed one of the overpayments when it gave the agency $160 million to settle a dispute with the federal government over supplemental Medicaid payments made to hospitals. The agency, though, ended up spending the money elsewhere, a mistake that the agency said occurred due to accounting errors.
During Wednesday’s meeting, Harris repeatedly stressed the difference between Hope Florida, which according to its website is a government initiative that serves as a connection point for collaboration between the public and private sector, faith-based communities, and nonprofits. Hope “navigators” work at agencies across state government with people seeking assistance in transitioning away from government benefits to economic self-sufficiency.
The Hope Florida Foundation is the not-for-profit direct support organization that assists Hope Florida.
Andrade and other members of the House panel spent the better part of a three-hour meeting pressing Harris, as well as Deputy Secretary for Medicaid Brian Meyer, on the details of the new statewide Medicaid managed care contracts — and about a requirement that contracted plans partner with the Department of Children and Families on its Hope Florida initiative. 
 Last minute invite?

Initially, Andrade pushed Meyer about the $10 million payment to Hope Florida Foundation and who made it. Meyer said he wasn’t prepared to answer the question. He said he was appearing before the committee on “relatively short notice” and, when his staff asked what the meeting was about, was told the requirements of the new Medicaid managed care contracts. Meyer said that was what he was prepared to discuss with the House budget panel.
“I think if there are other topics you want to discuss, maybe there is another time or individual to address those with.” Meyer said.
Andrade shot back: “Mr. Meyer, I believe that is a valid question to be asked here,” he said, continuing, “Are you telling me AHCA does not have the details of its own interactions with this nonprofit that is such a massive priority in the state’s largest contract?”
Mallory McManus, the former registered agent for the Hope Florida Foundation and a spokesperson for AHCA, issued a statement following the meeting criticizing Andrade.
“It’s concerning how little Representative Andrade understands about Medicaid, as demonstrated in his performative committee hearing today. He also purposely misconstrued the the structure and the nature of the Hope Florida program, which is shameful. AHCA is proud of our work serving Floridians particularly in helping people reduce government dependency and achieving economic self sufficiency.”

The City of Omaha is to own, maintain and operate the future Levi Carter Park Activity and Sports Complex along the north shore of Carter Lake in Levi Carter Park. That’s north of downtown, near Eppley Airfield.
A ceremonial groundbreaking Wednesday at the site drew politicians including Gov. Jim Pillen, Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert and City Councilwoman Juanita Johnson.
 Leveling the playing field 

Also speaking was former State Sen. Justin Wayne of Omaha, who helped lead legislative efforts in 2022 and 2023 to direct public funding to the historically disinvested area he represented.
Wayne, who was term-limited at the start of this year, expects the new facility to help level the playing field for families in North Omaha who have not had the same access to higher levels of youth sports as other more affluent areas.
“We have redlined youth sports in Omaha,” Wayne said, citing the dearth of athletic complexes in eastern Omaha compared to those that draw crowds and economic development to western Omaha and the suburbs.

Wayne, who coaches and referees youth sports, said sports and other community programming at the city-run park should be more financially accessible to local families.
Building activity at the site is to start next month.
Omaha officials said the community and athletic complex will include the largest basketball facility in Omaha, with 10 indoor basketball courts that can be converted to 14 volleyball courts. Among other features: a wrestling room; fitness area; computer lab; medical exam and tele-health rooms and a community meeting space.
Outside, the complex will offer four artificial turf soccer fields, new picnic shelters, a grand lawn and a designated food truck area.
Johnson recalled her younger years when she said Levi Carter Park on Sundays was a hub for social gatherings.
“We knew there’d be activities, food, laughter — this place would be the avenue we’d be able to do that,” she said. 
While Johnson said that type of community bustle waned in the last decade or so, she is excited that within a year or so it could return. The complex is expected to open in late 2026.
 Big deal, says governor

Stothert said the facility should generate new tourism and economic development for the area.

“This is an investment in youth and families, offering access to services and programs and creating new tourism and development opportunities surrounding Levi Carter Park,” she said.
“This is a big deal,” Pillen told the audience Wednesday. He said the complex can be a place where youths put away cell phones and engage in old-fashioned fun.
“Having played athletics growing up, I can testify firsthand to the valuable life lessons of team sports,” said Pillen, a former Husker football player. “They teach determination, cooperation and self-discipline.”
The governor gave shout outs to the city and Wayne, who with State Sen. Terrell McKinney of North championed the legislative effort to steer pandemic-related funding toward east Omaha.

The $45 million for the complex comes from a $35 million federal capital projects grant related to COVID-19 recovery and a $10 million award from the state’s North and South Omaha Recovery Grant Program.
Omaha parks director Matt Kalcevich said the facility creates opportunities for hosting regional basketball, volleyball and soccer tournaments and events.
“Health and wellness play a significant role in providing our outstanding quality of life in Omaha,” he said. “This facility will be an incredible enhancement to our mission.”

In March, the Iowa-incorporated company Sunterra Farms Iowa, and its affiliates, Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. were accused in U.S. District Court by one their lenders, Compeer Financial, of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme.
Compeer Financial is suing the three companies, which are run by the Price family of Yankton County, South Dakota. The companies are responsible for extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, with their parent companies based in Canada.
At Compeer’s request, a federal judge has appointed a receiver, Hannah Walkes of Pipestone Management II, to take control of the companies’ operations and ensure that Compeer’s collateral – 110,000 head of swine located in 54 barns in and around Yankton County – are fed and cared for. Walkes told the Iowa Capital Dispatch on Wednesday the pigs, which are destined for slaughter, are being properly cared for and are no longer at risk.
The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra Farms Iowa.
Bank: Family blamed CEO Ray Price for check kiting
In its lawsuit, Compeer claims that the Price family companies have engaged in a “long-running fraud” that involves check-kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.

Compeer alleges the transactions have had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest. Compeer claims that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed in February, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions between accounts with Compeer and Canadian Western Bank.
According to separate court filings by Canadian Western Bank in the Court of King’s Bench in Alberta, the “core guiding minds” of the defendant companies are CEO Ray Price, along with Douglas, Glen, David and Art Price — all of whom are directors and shareholders of various members of the Sunterra group of companies.
According to the Canadian bank, the Price companies issued checks that vastly exceeded their actual holdings — meaning none of the companies, at any point, had the actual cash on hand to pay the face value of the checks. The total amount of money circulated as a result of the alleged check-kiting scheme over a nine-month period exceeded 7 billion Canadian dollars, or 4.9 billion American dollars, the bank claims.
In Canadian court filings, Canadian Western Bank alleges that at a meeting on Feb. 24, 2025, Art and Glen Price “made various clear and unequivocal statements” indicating the overdrafts were caused by CEO Ray Price, with whom they were “upset and disappointed.”
Not long after that meeting, however, the Price family allegedly refused to allow Compeer and the Canadian bank to share information as they investigated the matter.
‘Contempt of court’ issue is raised by receiver
While case in Canadian court has advanced, conflicts have arisen in the U.S. District Court proceedings involving Walkes, the newly appointed receiver tasked with taking control of the Price family companies.
According to documents filed with the court by Walkes, she went to the Sunterra Farms Iowa offices in Beresford, South Dakota, on the morning of March 31 to gather financial information. She alleges that while she was logged onto Sunterra’s online accounting platform, she noticed “all information regarding accounts receivable, accounts payable and general ledger were missing.”
A short time later, she told the court, she received “a message that we had been entirely kicked out of the accounting platform.” After logging back in, she alleged, she discovered that information — including data she had previously accessed — was missing.
“I have serious concerns that the data is being destroyed or manipulated,” Walkes told the court, asking that the Price family companies be required to show cause as to why they shouldn’t be held in contempt of court.

Court records show an attorney for Walkes sent an email to Sunterra’s lawyers, stating, “Someone knew that the receiver was on site and reviewing accounting information, and information and data started disappearing at the same time, which is a direct violation of the court’s order.”
An attorney for the Price companies wrote back to Walkes’ attorney, questioning those claims and asking, “Will this type of aggression take place at every turn or will the receiver act in the best interest of all parties as it is required?”
Four days later, Walkes updated the court on the situation, indicating some of the issues had been resolved and that while she still didn’t know whether some data had been removed, she believed she had gained access to enough information to manage the accounts for two of the three companies — Sunwold and Lariagra.
However, she told the court, with regard to Sunterra Farms, that company functions as the management entity for the other two, and after she attempted to run financial reports for Sunterra, they “reflected all zeros. The Sunterra Farms journal entries were blank where financial information used to exist.”
In that same update to the court, she indicated that she had just learned the Sunterra information had been restored, but she still was unable to access information pertaining to the Price family’s parent companies in Canada. Walkes asked the court to clarify her authority to gain access to that information.
In response, Sunterra and its affiliates argued Walkes had no “permission to reach across the border into Canada to look at information not belonging to” the companies.
On Monday, U.S. District Judge Eric Schulte gave lawyers for Sunterra and its affiliates to until the end of day Wednesday to file “an unequivocal declaration” that no evidence had been destroyed or manipulated.
As for the receiver’s access to information on the Canadian parent companies, Schulte gave the companies’ lawyers the same deadline to request a protective order that articulated the “reasons why they believe such information should be protected from disclosure.”

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)The Ohio House advanced its two-year spending plan Wednesday despite sharp criticism from the chamber’s Democrats. The House’s version of the operating budget nixes several of the governor’s policy priorities and helps fund a new stadium for the Cleveland Browns.
The bill also walks back of some the House’s initial plans, but only slightly.
A proposal to force property tax reductions on the back of school district rainy day funds will allow administrators to carry over 30% of their budget instead of 25%. Budget drafters are scrapping a new population-based system for distributing library funding, but they’re not giving up on moving to a dollar figure appropriation instead of a percentage of the general revenue fund.
With Wednesday’s vote, the budget now moves to the state Senate, where lawmakers are sure to roll out on their own slate of changes. They’ll have time to mull it over as lawmakers leave for a two-week Easter recess.
The 2026 fiscal year begins on July 1; lawmakers have until then to finish off the budget.
Stadium funding skirmish
Ohio House Finance Chairman, state Rep. Brian Stewart, R- Ashville, kicked off testimony, describing how the spending plan eliminates taxes from the governor’s proposal and spends $4.4 billion less in state money.
Those tax increases in governor’s proposal would’ve paid for a $1,000 child tax credit and a new fund for future stadium deals.
Instead, House Republicans favor a $600 million bond package in support of Cleveland’s proposed facility. “It is the most conservative stadium funding proposal in America,” Stewart insisted, arguing tax receipts from the project will pay back the debt. He went on to offer an amendment increasing from $38.5 million to $50 million a deposit paid by Brown’s ownership.
And that’s about where things went off the rails.
Rep. Sean Brennan, D-Parma, piped up with an amendment to Stewart’s eliminating the bond package entirely.
Rather than letting that Brennan proceed, House Speaker Matt Huffman ordered the chamber to stand at ease for several minutes. When session resumed, Huffman quickly called a vote despite Democratic lawmakers’ objections and points of order.
In the confusion, many Democrats didn’t wind up voting on the amendment at all. It passed 55-15.
Schools, property taxes, libraries and Medicaid
Ohio House GOP budget proposal slashes public school funding

Many Democrats objected to a K-12 funding model that abandons the so-called fair school funding plan lawmakers have been working toward in the last two budget cycles. State Rep. Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, said that setting aside that formula returns to an ad hoc funding approach the Ohio Supreme Court ruled unconstitutional.
“This proposal is leading Ohio students and taxpayers back down a path of artificial guarantees, back to square one, back to residual funding, back to the days where school (funding) was based not on what it cost to educate a child, but what the General Assembly decides that it feels like paying for education.”
While school districts worry about how much funding is coming in, they could also have to consider how much is sitting on their balance sheet. The budget would direct county officials to pare back the property taxes which support schools if a district maintains a balance worth more than 30% of their annual budget.
“We are saying that government is not a piggy bank,” state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, argued, criticizing those carryovers as a poor return on taxpayers’ investment.
State Rep. Jack Daniels, R-New Franklin, defended the changes to library funding. He said “no agency is entitled to an increase,” and that making appropriations based on a percentage of the general revenue fund amounts to an “obligation.” And he complained the budget isn’t actually cutting dollars to libraries.
“They feel they’re being cut, when in fact, we are not cutting,” he said. “We’re just not providing the increase they expect.”
Notably, the Ohio Library Council determined the House proposal would appropriate at least $40 million less each year than the governor’s proposal.
Democrats also worry that the budget locks the state into radical changes to the Medicaid program if federal government makes even modest reductions to its 90% share of the program.
“If federal funding drops even slightly, say from 90% to 89% the entire program would be ended,” Rep. Rachel Baker, D-Cincinnati said. “That’s right, a 1% cut in federal funding would terminate the program that provides health care access to almost 800,000 Ohioans.”
Rep. Stewart downplayed the likelihood of federal changes, but argued the state expanded the program on the promise that the federal government would cover 90% of the program.
Rep. Jean Schmidt, R-Loveland, meanwhile praised the budget for “push(ing) back against the wokeness we are facing by prohibiting Medicaid funds from being used for discriminatory DEI programs and establishing a statewide policy recognize that there are only two sexes.”
Final tally
Rep. Dani Isaacsohn, D-Cincinnati said, “We are not the sexiest state, but that’s not what makes Ohio so special.”
Ohio doesn’t have beaches or mountains to draw people in, but it can offer quality of life.
“People move here because they want to start family, they want to buy a home, they want to send their kids to a great school,” he said. But with the House proposal, lawmakers “are failing to meet those basic benchmarks.”
“The only piece of this budget — that is big and complicated — that got the full breadth of the creativity of this body,” he argued, “is a $600 million subsidy for billionaires who own a failing sports team,”
In his closing remarks, Rep. Stewart dismissed Democrats’ criticism.
“You know how many GRF general revenue fund dollars that are being spent for the Cleveland Browns in this budget?” he said. “Zero — zero, not one dollar.”
Stewart concluded the House proposal represents more money than the current budget for K-12 schools, higher ed, child care, and libraries. The measure would also amount to more than $4 billion in property tax relief — the largest, he said, in state history.
“Voting no on this budget means you are voting against all of those things,” he said. “That’s a tough vote, folks. Voting no on this budget is a master’s class in missing the forest for the trees.”
In the end, five Republicans voted against the proposal, but it still passed easily 60-39.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas Senate committee voted down a bill that would have extended Medicaid coverage for women 12 months after giving birth if they do not already qualify for the state’s Medicaid expansion program.
House Bill 1004 passed the House April 1 with a bipartisan 71 votes but failed in the Senate Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on a split voice vote Wednesday. More than half of births in Arkansas are covered by Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance system for low-income Americans.
Arkansas’ Medicaid expansion program covers people up to 138% of the federal poverty level, but since Jan. 1, 2023, Medicaid covers pregnant Arkansans with incomes of up to 214% of the federal poverty level, or about $45,200 for a family of 2 or $68,700 for a family of four. This coverage expires two months after birth, leaving many postpartum Arkansans to “fall through the cracks,” said Sen. Breanne Davis, a Russellville Republican and HB 1004’s Senate sponsor.
Davis mentioned that Arkansas has one of the nation’s highest maternal mortality rates and the third highest infant mortality rate. Maternal mortality is measured by the rate at which women die during childbirth or within a year of giving birth.
“We have got to address this holistically, and I think there’s been a lot of really good work done, but it has not included this group of women,” who do not qualify for Medicaid expansion, Davis said.
Extending postpartum Medicaid coverage has the support of legislative Democrats, and House Minority Leader Andrew Collins of Little Rock sponsored House Bill 1008, which is similar to HB 1004 but has not been heard in committee.

Arkansas maternal health care landscape needs more coordination and teamwork, physicians say

 

Without the policy outlined in the bills, Arkansas remains the only state that has taken no action to adopt the federal option of extending postpartum Medicaid coverage from 60 days to 12 months after birth, according to KFF.
Davis told the Public Health committee that the bill was “narrowly tailored” and would not create any “duplicative” services.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Human Services Secretary Kristi Putnam said repeatedly last year that 12-month postpartum Medicaid would be “redundant” and “duplicative,” since the state has other insurance coverage options for postpartum low-income Arkansans. A maternal health task force convened by Sanders did not include the 12-month policy in its September 2024 list of recommendations to improve the state’s maternal health care landscape.
State Medicaid officials Janet Mann and Elizabeth Pitman expressed DHS’ opposition to HB 1004 Wednesday. Mann mentioned that DHS estimated it would cost more than $11.2 million to add 10 months of coverage to existing programs.
DHS’ assessment of the bill’s overall fiscal impact states that the federal government would cover more than $8.8 million of the cost, leaving the state to cover less than $2.4 million. Davis told the committee that Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP) funds would support the proposed coverage extension.
From July 1 to Dec. 31, 2024, roughly 60% of postpartum Arkansans remained Medicaid-eligible after the 60-day limit, according to two quarterly reports that a 2024 law requires DHS to submit to the Legislature. Putnam and Mann presented the first report in October, and the Advocate received the second report from DHS in February via a public records request.

Arkansas DHS officials say they want to find insurance for low-income, Medicaid-ineligible new moms


Of the 1,787 women who did not qualify for Medicaid past 60 days postpartum between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31, 42% of them had income above 138% of the federal poverty level, and 38% were not U.S. citizens, according to DHS’ second quarterly report.
By July 1, Arkansas’ Medicaid program will include presumptive Medicaid eligibility for pregnant Arkansans, reimbursements for doulas and community health workers and pregnancy-related Medicaid coverage for specific treatments, Mann said Wednesday.
In February, Sanders signed the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act to put these policies into effect. The legislation had bipartisan sponsorship, including from Davis and HB 1004’s House sponsor, Knoxville Republican Rep. Aaron Pilkington.











One day we’ll get these women covered, and I’m sure people will ask what took so long.


– Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, House sponsor of HB 1004



 Public testimony

The five Arkansans who spoke in favor of HB 1004 were all Black women; Arkansas’ Black maternal mortality rate more than doubled from 1999 to 2019, according to a 2023 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
Extending postpartum Medicaid coverage is essential for “helping families heal and remain together,” said Stephanie Garner, CEO of the Arkansas River Valley Area Council, a Russellville-based assistance organization for low-income families.
“Substance use disorders and mental health conditions don’t resolve in two months,” Garner said. “When coverage ends, I’ve seen women relapse, return to unsafe environments or even lose custody of their children, not because they didn’t want to get better, but because they lost access to care that was helping them recover.”
Danielle Wright, a single mother from Jackson County, said she lost Medicaid coverage after having her third child via an emergency Caesarean section that led her to seek mental health care.
“At one point [I was] even finding myself crying in a DHS office because I was having to prove a difficult moment that I was not ready to experience and relive in that moment,” said Wright, who also supported HB 1004 before the House Public Health committee in March.
Maternal mental health “cannot be separated” from maternal health as a whole, and untreated mental health issues during pregnancy can lead to poor birth outcomes and increased maternal mortality, therapist and social worker Mackenzi Foreman said.

Foreman and Arkansas Birthing Project executive director Zenobia Harris both said they have worked with women who unexpectedly lost their Medicaid coverage while they were pregnant.
Latoya Morgan said she supported HB 1004 on behalf of her friend, Helena Stanton, who died after the complicated premature birth of her third child.
“Shortly after giving birth, Helena began experiencing severe difficulties with her mobility, struggling to move her limbs and ultimately [to] breathe,” Morgan said. “She didn’t have access to a doctor until it became an emergency because she didn’t have access to Medicaid.”
After the committee voted down the bill, Morgan expressed frustration with the outcome in an interview, saying DHS officials and the majority of the committee lacked empathy for low-income pregnant Arkansans.
“[Lawmakers] claim to be Christians and believers of Christ, but you’re unwilling to take care of all of the people, the sick, the women that create life… because of what, funding?” Morgan said. “Because it’s not your sister, because it’s not your wife, because it’s not your daughter?”
A 2023 bill similar to HB 1004 never received a committee hearing, and Pilkington was the House sponsor of both bills. He said Wednesday that he was disappointed HB 1004 did not advance.
“I promised that I wouldn’t leave these women behind, and I did all I could,” he said. “The fact that I had to fight back against so many lies was the most disheartening part about this whole process. One day we’ll get these women covered, and I’m sure people will ask what took so long.”

In March, the Iowa-incorporated company Sunterra Farms Iowa, and its affiliates, Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. were accused in U.S. District Court by one their lenders, Compeer Financial, of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme.
Compeer Financial is suing the three companies, which are run by the Price family of Yankton County, South Dakota. The companies are responsible for extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, with their parent companies based in Canada.
At Compeer’s request, a federal judge has appointed a receiver, Hannah Walkes of Pipestone Management II, to take control of the companies’ operations and ensure that Compeer’s collateral – 110,000 head of swine located in 54 barns in and around Yankton County – are fed and cared for. Walkes told the Iowa Capital Dispatch on Wednesday the pigs, which are destined for slaughter, are being properly cared for and are no longer at risk.
The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra Farms Iowa.
Bank: Family blamed CEO Ray Price for check kiting
In its lawsuit, Compeer claims that the Price family companies have engaged in a “long-running fraud” that involves check-kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.
Compeer alleges the transactions have had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest. Compeer claims that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed in February, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions between accounts with Compeer and Canadian Western Bank.
According to separate court filings by Canadian Western Bank in the Court of King’s Bench in Alberta, the “core guiding minds” of the defendant companies are CEO Ray Price, along with Douglas, Glen, David and Art Price — all of whom are directors and shareholders of various members of the Sunterra group of companies.
According to the Canadian bank, the Price companies issued checks that vastly exceeded their actual holdings — meaning none of the companies, at any point, had the actual cash on hand to pay the face value of the checks. The total amount of money circulated as a result of the alleged check-kiting scheme over a nine-month period exceeded 7 billion Canadian dollars, or 4.9 billion American dollars, the bank claims.
In Canadian court filings, Canadian Western Bank alleges that at a meeting on Feb. 24, 2025, Art and Glen Price “made various clear and unequivocal statements” indicating the overdrafts were caused by CEO Ray Price, with whom they were “upset and disappointed.”
Not long after that meeting, however, the Price family allegedly refused to allow Compeer and the Canadian bank to share information as they investigated the matter.
‘Contempt of court’ issue is raised by receiver
While case in Canadian court has advanced, conflicts have arisen in the U.S. District Court proceedings involving Walkes, the newly appointed receiver tasked with taking control of the Price family companies.
According to documents filed with the court by Walkes, she went to the Sunterra Farms Iowa offices in Beresford, South Dakota, on the morning of March 31 to gather financial information. She alleges that while she was logged onto Sunterra’s online accounting platform, she noticed “all information regarding accounts receivable, accounts payable and general ledger were missing.”
A short time later, she told the court, she received “a message that we had been entirely kicked out of the accounting platform.” After logging back in, she alleged, she discovered that information — including data she had previously accessed — was missing.
“I have serious concerns that the data is being destroyed or manipulated,” Walkes told the court, asking that the Price family companies be required to show cause as to why they shouldn’t be held in contempt of court.
Court records show an attorney for Walkes sent an email to Sunterra’s lawyers, stating, “Someone knew that the receiver was on site and reviewing accounting information, and information and data started disappearing at the same time, which is a direct violation of the court’s order.”
An attorney for the Price companies wrote back to Walkes’ attorney, questioning those claims and asking, “Will this type of aggression take place at every turn or will the receiver act in the best interest of all parties as it is required?”
Four days later, Walkes updated the court on the situation, indicating some of the issues had been resolved and that while she still didn’t know whether some data had been removed, she believed she had gained access to enough information to manage the accounts for two of the three companies — Sunwold and Lariagra.
However, she told the court, with regard to Sunterra Farms, that company functions as the management entity for the other two, and after she attempted to run financial reports for Sunterra, they “reflected all zeros. The Sunterra Farms journal entries were blank where financial information used to exist.”
In that same update to the court, she indicated that she had just learned the Sunterra information had been restored, but she still was unable to access information pertaining to the Price family’s parent companies in Canada. Walkes asked the court to clarify her authority to gain access to that information.
In response, Sunterra and its affiliates argued Walkes had no “permission to reach across the border into Canada to look at information not belonging to” the companies.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Wednesday approved a bill that would allow some people serving long prison sentences to have their cases reviewed.
SB 156, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, allows people who were sentenced under the Habitual Felony Offender Act to have their cases reviewed and have the chance to be released from prison if they did not commit a crime that caused physical injury.
“These individuals, if this bill goes into effect, would have served at least, hear me now, at least 25 years for an offense where there was no physical injury,” Barfoot said to members of the House Judiciary Committee. “We routinely sentence and send people to prison for much less time for violent offenses such as murder and robbery.”

The Habitual Felony Offender Act, enacted in 1977, required the state to impose a life sentence on anyone convicted of a Class B felony who had three prior felony convictions on their record, and life without parole for anyone convicted of a Class A felony.
The law is widely considered to be a major driver of the state’s prison overcrowding crisis. The Legislature in 2000 approved changes to the law that gave judges more flexibility in sentencing, but the changes were not retroactive.
Barfoot’s bill only applies to individuals sentenced to life without the possibility of parole prior to May 2000, when the Legislature approved the changes. Those with anyone convicted for homicide, a sexual offense or attempted murder would not be eligible for review.
Those who are eligible may file to have their cases reviewed in the county where they were sentenced. Notices will then be sent to relevant parties such as prosecutors, victims as well as the Attorney General’s Office that will then review the filing to determine if the person is eligible.
If the applicant is determined to be eligible, the court will review the case to consider if the person should be resentenced based on specific factors: the underlying offense, how the person behaved while incarcerated in prison, the person’s age and the likelihood the person will be successful after being released from prison.
The bill requires those eligible for review to file a request by October 2030.
It was the House’s first opportunity to consider the legislation after the Senate took two rounds of votes to eventually get the measure approved. House members voted down the measure during the 2024 session.
The House Judiciary Committee approved an amendment during the committee that allows the Attorney General’s Office to review a person’s petition for a case review, but also the relevant details in the indictment, and have the agency speak to the case.
“This would be a safeguard to ensure that, if someone has pled to a lesser charge based off of the details of the crime, the relevant indictment would have details if there are elements that would preclude you from being eligible in this law by having the AG review the indictment,” said Rep. Russell Bedsole, R-Alabaster, who introduced the amendment.
It also states that the district attorney of the jurisdiction where the court will review the sentencing will have “weighted consideration” for the petition to have the sentence reduced.
The amendment also requires that data be collected regarding the crimes and convictions for the petitions that were filed, the counties that received the petitions and other information pertaining to petitioners.
Barfoot’s bill narrowly survived a vote in the Senate chamber in March when a majority of Republicans voted against the proposal, and it failed in the first vote 16-16. After nearly two hours, the legislation was reconsidered and passed by a vote of 17-8.
Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, filed a nearly identical proposal in previous sessions but was never enacted. During the 2024 session, his legislation was approved in the House Judiciary Committee, but Republicans voted to block the legislation on the House floor.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, publicly opposed the legislation, telling the committee that the bill goes beyond giving people a second chance, but five chances to be released from prison after committing an offense.
“I firmly disagree that someone who has three prior felonies, and one of those prior felonies being a Class A felony, who gets out and commits another one of those offenses that I have named to you deserves more of a chance to continuously come to the court, and continuously drag victims through the process,” Simpson said.
Elaine Burdeshaw, policy director for Alabama Appleseed, said people are serving sentences that are longer than those who commit violent crimes, and that challenges the notion of justice.
“Current sentencing practices, people can be convicted of much more serious violent crimes, and they are serving less time,” she said in an interview with the media following the meeting.
Darlene Hutchinson, a victim advocate, said she is not taking a position on the legislation, but is grateful that the bill was modified to take into account the impact it has on victims.
“It allowed for victims to be heard, but there was zero victim notification in it,” she said. “And I am fanatical about victim notification. My question to legislators then was, “How are victims going to be heard if they are not even going to be notified if their case was coming back to court.”

Rep. Joseph McNamara, a Warwick Democrat, sent a letter to Gov. Dan McKee Wednesday urging him to establish “free trade zones” under the powers granted to the governor by King Charles II in 1663. The document that established the colony of Rhode Island allowed free trade with colonies throughout the world.
“Our state has a long history of resisting unfair authoritative trade mandates and taxes,” McNamara wrote. “One only has to reflect back on our 252-year history to be reminded of the action that our early colonists took in 1772 when faced with an unlawful British vessel.”
He was referring to the HMS Gaspee, the British revenue schooner assigned to patrol Narragansett Bay that ran aground in Warwick and was plundered and burned by a group of colonists led by merchant John Brown.
McNamara suggests that the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation explore establishing trade agreements with international car manufacturers and creating a free trade zone within the Quonset Business Park in North Kingstown, one of the top 10 automobile importers in the U.S.
He pointed to the new air cargo terminal under construction at Rhode Island T.F. Green International Airport as an ideal location for duty-free imports and proposed that the Port of Providence be renamed the “Free Trade Port on the East Coast.”
McKee spokesperson Andrea Palagi acknowledged a request for comment, saying that a formal response would be sent from the Rhode Island Commerce Corporation.
The Commerce Corporation did not immediately respond to an inquiry.

It’s not a secret that some Idaho lawmakers delete their emails and text messages — which are public records when they relate to legislation and other official business, according to state law. 
But they rarely admit it publicly. 
Rep. Barbara Ehardt bucked this trend last week, in an attempt to bring some levity to a tense House debate over a bill that would restrict diversity, equity and inclusion on college and university campuses. 
The debate occurred Thursday, the penultimate day of a hectic legislative session. Ehardt, an Idaho Falls Republican who has long opposed DEI, said that she had received text messages from people “at the universities” who supported Senate Bill 1198. Then she addressed Statehouse reporters who were watching the debate and might want to see the messages.
“I’m gonna delete (them),” Ehardt said with a laugh. “Don’t put in the FOIA request.” 
Half an hour after the House approved the anti-DEI bill, Idaho Education News hand-delivered a public records request to Ehardt. 
Too late. The messages were gone.  
Ehardt later told EdNews that her comment “was all meant to add a little levity” on the House floor. When asked why she didn’t want reporters to see the messages, Ehardt said that the authors may not have expected their texts to be public.
“No one’s anticipating that that’s going to get shared,” she said. “Obviously, if I hadn’t said anything, nobody would have known.”
State law exempts from disclosure personal communications by a member of the Legislature, but communications related to “the conduct or administration of the public’s business” are considered public. In other words, someone who messages a lawmaker about a bill shouldn’t expect that it will remain private.
While Ehardt’s stunt was clearly meant to be funny, it raised a more serious question: Why are lawmakers allowed to destroy public records?
Unlike the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), which applies to federal agencies, the Idaho Public Records Act doesn’t have a retention provision that bars destroying records before a certain period of time. 
  Rep. Barbara Ehardt, R-Idaho Falls, makes an announcement from the House floor on March 10, 2025, at the Idaho Capitol Building in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
State agencies adhere to a schedule — created by the Idaho State Historical Society — that guides how long various types of records should be retained, and local governments set their own guidelines. But similar rules don’t apply to the Legislature. 
Lawmakers can trash their records at any time, unless someone files an official request to see them. Destroying records after they’ve been identified in a request would violate the Public Records Act, but Ehardt didn’t appear to do that in this case. 
Still, her decision to delete the texts is a good example of why the state needs more specific retention requirements, said Scott McIntosh, First Amendment committee chairman for the Idaho Press Club. 
“The decisionmaking process of state legislators is the public’s business and should be done in public,” said McIntosh, who is also opinion editor for the Idaho Statesman. “Deleting text messages cited by a lawmaker during a legislative debate is anathema to the Idaho values of open and honest government.”
Journalists and other members of the public often rely on correspondence records to shed light on government work that happens behind closed doors. Here are some recent examples from EdNews:

Emails between West Ada School District administrators and trustees exposed internal turmoil after the district told a teacher to remove a classroom sign promoting inclusivity.
Messages between Idaho State University President Robert Wagner and House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, revealed that ISU is considering the feasibility of buying a private medical school in Meridian. 
Public comments on a divisive bill to fund private education using tax dollars showed widespread opposition to the proposal that was ultimately signed into law. 

On Tuesday, Ehardt declined to share details on the messages, except that they were from people affiliated with multiple universities and they weren’t from students. Ehardt said she will retain EdNews’ records request, however. 
“I did scan and copy and save that for time and all posterity,” she said.

David Yates, D-Louisville, the Senate minority whip, speaking at Wednesday’s monthly meeting of the [&#8230;]","Democratic Sen. David Yates, left, and Republican Rep. Jason Nemes shared their views on the 2025 legislative session with the Louisville Forum Wednesday. (LRC Public Information photos)LOUISVILLE — Two Kentucky legislative leaders — one Republican, the other a Democrat — offered sharply divergent views of the 2025 legislative session that ended March 28.
“It’s the good, the bad and the ugly and that’s the truth,” said Sen. David Yates, D-Louisville, the Senate minority whip, speaking at Wednesday’s monthly meeting of the Louisville Forum, a nonpartisan public interest group.
Rep. Jason Nemes, R-Middletown and House majority whip, had a different take on accomplishments of the Kentucky General Assembly, where Republicans hold supermajorities in both chambers.
“I think this was the second-best session in the history of Kentucky,” Nemes said, adding it was surpassed only by legislative accomplishments of last year, when lawmakers enacted a new, two-year budget. Nemes was elected to leadership in November 2022.
The one-hour session moderated  by WHAS11 reporter Isaiah Kim-Martinez at times grew animated as the lawmakers discussed legislation affecting taxes, Medicaid, abortion, transgender medical care, the environment and the need for more transparency in legislative proceedings where bills sometimes are subject to last-minute revisions.
The Kentucky League of Women Voters and other outside groups have criticized Kentucky lawmakers for routine “fast-track” maneuvers that provide little to no time for public scrutiny.
“We need to do better,” Nemes acknowledged. “I’m not making excuses. We could do better.”
Yates agreed, saying changes to bills came through so fast on the final days of the legislative session that copies were still hot from the copying machine. Lawmakers should do better, possibly by making changes available immediately on the legislative website, he said.
“The technology is there,” Yates said, adding that as a member of leadership, he found himself trying to explain last-minute changes to Senate Democrats even while the vote was underway. “I think we could definitely do better.”
‘Distraction’ bills
Yates also criticized the 2025 session for focusing too much on cultural issues including banning Medicaid coverage for transgender health services; limiting such care for  inmates; and cancelling Gov. Andy Beshear’s restriction on “conversion therapy,” a controversial practice aimed at gay youth that Yates called “barbaric.”
Lawmakers also enacted, over Beshear’s veto, House Bill 4 banning diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, measures at public colleges and universities.
Yates called them “distraction bills,” adding, “We should focus on legislation that moves Kentucky forward.” Critics have referred to such measures as “hate bills.”
Nemes disputed the critics’ characterization.
“There were no hate bills this session,” he said.
Limits on public funds for transgender services were simply meant to ensure no “taxpayer dollars” would be used for such care — not as an attack on the small fraction of Kentuckians who identify as transgender, he said.
“If you’re a transgender person, I want happiness for you,” Nemes said. “I love you and I want you to be very successful.”
As for conversion therapy, licensing boards for professionals such as psychologists and social workers can establish standards to prevent conversion therapy if they choose, Nemes said.
‘We got it done’
KY doctors say GOP lawmakers’ attempt to clarify abortion ban confuses instead

Other issues the two touched on include a last-minute addition to a bill to attempt to define when physicians can perform emergency abortions. Abortion is banned by state law except to save the life or prevent disabling injury to a pregnant person.
Nemes defended changes he made to House Bill 90, his bill that also allows free-standing birth centers. It adds to state law a list of certain conditions under which doctors can legally end a pregnancy, such as hemorrhage or ectopic pregnancies, but critics have said it still leaves pregnant patients at risk and doctors at risk of prosecution.
Nemes disagreed with criticism of the changes to state abortion law he acknowledged were rushed through.
“We got it done and I’m proud of it,” he said. “I’m not proud of the process but we got it done.”
Yates, a lawyer who handles personal injury cases, said he’s still not sure the changes would protect physicians or pregnant women.
“Everyone hopes that is the case,” he said. “We’ll see.”
As for other accomplishments, Nemes cited House Bill 775, a sweeping measure changed late in the session to include changes to Kentucky’s tax law and make it easier to lower Kentucky’s income tax, an ongoing effort by Republican lawmakers.
It also includes economic incentives for Louisville aimed at downtown development, Nemes said.
“We’re putting our money where our mouth is,” Nemes said. “I am very bullish on the General Assembly and how it’s treating Louisville.”
Yates said the legislature needs to proceed with caution as it works to cut the state income tax.
“In the event it goes down to zero,” he said, “I promise there will be other taxes.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3-2-1024x819.jpg,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

Free.,"Trump attack on state climate laws likely doomed, but attempts to yank funds may be next",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-attack-state-climate-laws-likely-doomed-attempts-yank-funds-may-be-next,,"An executive order President Donald Trump signed Tuesday to block state-level renewable-energy initiatives set off alarm bells among climate advocates.But experts and state policy groups said constitutional protections will blunt any effect the order would have on state operations.The order, one of four Trump signed Tuesday aiming to revitalize the coal industry, directs the U.S. Justice Department to investigate and block enforcement of state laws that restrict fossil fuel production. It specifically targets state and local policies involving climate change, environmental justice and carbon emissions reductions — popular among blue states.By attempting to strip states of their own authority to make and enforce laws, the order violates basic constitutional principles and would likely be struck down in court, environmental law experts said Wednesday.Brad Campbell, the president of the New England-based environmental advocacy group Conservation Law Foundation, said in an interview with States Newsroom the order does not cite any federal law or interest the administration is seeking to protect — though the order does mention interstate commerce and an objective to improve national security — revealing it is more about messaging than policymaking.“This is political theater more than it is law,” Campbell said. “It completely disregards the understanding of federalism that has been in place for centuries and the language of the Constitution itself.”While the order itself may be unlikely to withstand legal scrutiny, it signals the administration could make demands about climate policy that would have to be obeyed at risk of losing federal cash, advocates said.Trump officials already have shown an eagerness in their first months for using federal funding as leverage with states, universities and other institutions that are outside the federal government’s control.In a statement, White House spokesman Taylor Rogers said Wednesday the order would protect against states assuming the power to regulate international issues like climate change.“The President is right to ensure that Americans in both red and blue states are not beholden to State overreach stifling American energy that are unconstitutional or contradict federal law,” she said.Climate action ‘irreconcilable’ with Trump agendaThe order includes a lengthy preamble attempting to justify federal involvement in state and local policymaking, while also noting that state policies focusing on emissions reductions and climate protections are at odds with Trump’s goals.“These State laws and policies try to dictate interstate and international disputes over air, water, and natural resources; unduly discriminate against out-of-State businesses; contravene the equality of States; and retroactively impose arbitrary and excessive fines without legitimate justification,” the order’s opening section reads.“These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy.  They should not stand.”At the Tuesday signing ceremony for the order and three others on coal production, White House Staff Secretary Will Scharf told the president that states promoting renewable sources of energy were a major part of the coal industry’s decline.“One of the biggest problems we have in this space is Democrat states, radical leftist states, enacting policies and enacting an agenda that discriminates against coal, against secure sources of energy,” Scharf said.The order, though, does little to change the market and technological forces that have led to the coal industry’s decline, Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, the executive director of the environmental group Western Environmental Law Center, said Wednesday.“I just don't see how the order … is going to do anything but create confusion and uncertainties for communities that are transitioning away from coal right now,” he said.“In many respects, it does an injustice to those communities by giving them a false sense of hope that somehow coal mines and coal-fired power plants are suddenly going to be resurrected from the dead or be pushed well beyond their economic and technological lifespan.”States undeterredEnvironmental lawyers and climate advocates said the order does not change the constitutional structure of the U.S. government that empowers states to set their own laws.Casey Katims, the executive director of the U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 governors seeking to prioritize state-focused climate policy, said the group’s members would not be moved by the order.“The reality is that states continue to enjoy broad, independent constitutional authority to advance solutions to meet the needs of communities, businesses and workers,” Katims said in a Wednesday interview. “The president cannot change the Constitution by fiat.”The group’s co-chairs, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, both Democrats, said in a Tuesday statement the administration had no power to block state authority and the coalition would be undeterred by the order.“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” they said. “We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred.”If the Justice Department, under Attorney General Pam Bondi, sues to stop enforcement of state laws, courts would likely reinforce states’ well-understood power to govern themselves, Campbell said.Even the U.S. Supreme Court, which has a conservative supermajority that includes three members appointed by Trump and has shown deference to even the most controversial actions of his second presidency, would move to restrain that federal power, Campbell predicted.“I think the notion that the president can stop enforcement of state laws that don’t align with his political program will be too much of an overreach even for this very Trump-friendly Supreme Court majority,” he said.Further, he said, even Republican governors, whose party has traditionally advocated for increased states’ rights in relation to the federal government, might object to the intrusion of the executive branch into state policymaking. Allowing action under the order would set a precedent for a future Democratic president to meddle in Republican states, he said.Federal fundingThe lack of legal authority to directly block enforcement of state laws may not keep the Trump administration from exercising power in another way: withholding federal funds from uncooperative states.The order signals the administration, which has been bold in asserting a power to deny congressionally appropriated funding, could target states over climate policy, Schlenker-Goodrich said.“Do they have a legal basis? Not really,” he said. “Can they use political weapons, in particular relative to funding, against states that are stepping up on climate action? That is very much a possibility. That is the direction you will see the White House going.”",,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

(Eddie Moore/Albuquerque Journal)As firearm-related deaths of young people in New Mexico increase, the state’s senior senator in Congress introduced two pieces of legislation on Wednesday intended to address gun violence.
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) is co-sponsoring the first bill, called the GOSAFE Act, which would regulate the sale, transfer and manufacture of gas-operated semi-automatic firearms. He introduced the same legislation in 2023.
Heinrich is also co-sponsoring another bill, called the BUMP Act, which would ban the sale of “bump stocks” and other devices or modifications that convert semi-automatic firearms into fully automatic ones.
“For too long, Congress has failed to stem the onslaught of mass shootings,” Heinrich said in a statement. “As a sportsman and gun owner, I’m committed to upholding the laws that protect responsible gun ownership, but we must do more to prevent deadly weapons from reaching those who are all too ready to turn them against our communities.”
Heinrich introduced the legislation less than three weeks after a mass shooting in Las Cruces, New Mexico’s second-largest city, which left three dead and 15 others injured. Four people have been arrested so far in connection to the shooting, including a 20-year-old and three teenagers, according to local police.
Firearm-related deaths among children and teenagers in the U.S. increased by 50% between 2019 and 2023, Stateline reports. In 2023, firearms remained the leading cause of death among young people in the U.S. for the fourth year in a row, according to the latest mortality data released by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
In New Mexico, 33 firearm-related deaths occurred among people under 18 in 2023, a 24% increase from 2019, the data show. The state experienced a slight decrease in 2021, but the number of deaths increased in 2022 and 2023, the data show.
Youth gun deaths in the US have surged 50% since 2019

Miranda Viscoli, co-president of New Mexicans to Prevent Gun Violence, applauded Heinrich for introducing the bills in a statement on Tuesday, saying he is “leading the charge for gun violence prevention in New Mexico and across the country.”
“The GOSAFE Act will help make our communities safer from gun violence,” Viscoli said in a statement. “These highly lethal firearms have no place in civilian hands.”
The BUMP Act, Viscoli added, will “bolster our legal framework that makes it possible for law enforcement to address the epidemic of violence that New Mexicans have experienced through guns modified to be fully automatic.”
A single legislative committee approved a similar proposal to change New Mexico state law in the most recent legislative session, but the bill never received a vote in either chamber of the New Mexico Legislature.
Heinrich said the bills represent a continuation of the work Congress did by passing the 2022 Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which enabled licensed firearms dealers to check FBI records to see if a gun offered for sale was stolen, mandated checks of juvenile criminal history and mental health records of people under 21 trying to buy a gun, and created new crimes for “straw purchases” of guns on behalf of someone who isn’t allowed to have one, among other reforms.

Ford Carr, D-Wichita, reviews evidence in a complaint against him during an April 9, 2025, investigative hearing. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A six-member House Select Investigating Committee on Wednesday split votes along party lines and failed to reprimand, censure or expel Rep. Ford Carr for his behavior that included an altercation in a Topeka bar.
Instead, the committee of three Democrats and three Republicans voted 5-1 to write a report for the House about the committee’s failure to reach agreement, potentially recommending Carr, a Wichita Democrat, be admonished. Rep. Mike Amyx, D-Lawrence, was the lone no vote. The committee will reconvene to approve the report before it is sent to the House, as there was some disagreement about asking for an admonishment of Carr.
It wasn’t the result Carr expected.
Pointing to a complaint he filed against Rep. Nick Hoheisel, a Wichita Republican, Carr said the only options presented were dismissal, reprimand, censure or expulsion.
“It angers me,” he said. “None of these were options when it was Rep. Hoheisel.”
Carr said he expected the committee to split votes 3-3 and send the complaint to the House, where it would require a two-thirds vote to take action. Admonishment had never been on the table, he said.
Whatever the term used, Carr said the committee’s determination won’t change him.
“I represent my people the way I represent my people,” he said. “I am in no way going to alter the way I represent my people.”
He added, referring to the fact he retained his seat after last year’s election: “The people have already spoken. I am going to continue to be me.”
Carr has contended that racism and lack of acceptance for a Black man who operates in a different culture fueled the complaint and investigation, all of which the complainant denied immediately in a statement to the committee.
Rep. Leah Howell, a Derby Republican, filed the complaint alleging that Carr broke a House rule about using disorderly words while debating legislation. Listed in her complaint were multiple instances that she said indicate Carr’s behavior is not in line with the decorum and conduct required of a Kansas representative.
“I want to clarify that this complaint is not about retaliation, partisan politics or personal conflicts,” she said. “Contrary to accusations that this complaint is racially motivated, the color of skin and political party have absolutely nothing to do with my decision to file this complaint.”
Howell pointed to an altercation at the Celtic Fox in Topeka in which video surfaced of Carr and Wichita City Councilman Brandon Johnson loudly arguing and calling each other names. When Rep. Henry Helgerson, an Eastborough Democrat, tried to intervene, he was knocked to the floor, although he refused to press charges. Howell, who is married to a Wichita city councilman, said she considered Carr’s words at the Celtic Fox to be threatening. She focused on several incidents that she said make a pattern.
“I will argue that accusing colleagues of racism, calling one of them a racial slur, lying to this committee and that infamous public display of repeated use of racial slurs and aggression by what should be described as an act of battery against two other elected officials can be collectively classified as not only misconduct, but a pattern of violent rhetoric and behavior,” Howell said.

Carr, during his 15 minutes speaking to the committee, disagreed with Howell’s assessment of what happened in each of the instances she described.
“Not by any stretch of anyone’s imagination is it OK for someone white to explain to me my culture and what I should be doing,” he said. “It is not your place to tell me what I’m supposed to do culturally as a Black man.”
He also explained to the committee the cultural difference between the words “n*****” and “n***a,” the second of which he said he was using in conversations the committee and complainant highlighted.
“Not once did I use the word n*****,” Carr said. “That’s not a word that we use in my culture. That is erroneous.”
Carr also brought out his birth certificate and pointed out that his race was identified as “Negro” on the Kansas document.
Rep. Susan Humphries, R-Wichita, and others on the committee questioned Carr extensively about a comment he made in 2023 on the House floor about a “House Negro,” which brought Carr an admonition from GOP leadership. But the committee ultimately agreed that incident didn’t apply to its considerations Wednesday, except seeing his behavior as part of a pattern.
Ultimately, the committee agreed that expulsion was off the table, commenting that such a move was usually connected to a criminal act. Members debated the difference between censuring and reprimanding, but a vote on reprimanding split 3-3 on party lines.
Even the idea of writing a report caused some contention, as Humphries waffled at the idea of writing a report that didn’t show any concerns with Carr’s behavior.
“I seconded the motion, but I’m not comfortable with a report that does not say that we made a finding,” Humphries said. “We made a finding that we are not going to dismiss, reprimand, censure or expel. Is there any agreement on this committee that there was behavior that was inappropriate?”
“Maybe you don’t want to say it publicly,” she added.

From business reporting to commentary to overall recognition, a swath of Reflector reporters, editors and contributors shared the 16 awards in the Division VII category. The task of writing these award summaries has fallen to me over the years, and you might think that the excitement fades, but it hasn’t yet. Being part of this staff and effort to bring free, nonprofit journalism to the Sunflower State remains a spectacular privilege.
Editor in chief Sherman Smith was named Kansas journalist of the year, his third time winning that award since founding the Reflector in the summer of 2020. He also won first place in the series category for coverage of the Marion County Record newspaper raid anniversary. He shared that award with independent journalist Marisa Kabas.
Former Reflector and Missouri Independent reporter Allison Kite and Stateline’s Kevin Hardy won first place for local business story.
Finally among the first place finishers, opinion contributors Eric Thomas and Mark McCormick were both recognized for column writing. I’m delighted to see Eric and Mark recognized for their determined, consistent and ever-readable pieces. I finished third in the category, which translates to a Reflector sweep of the top three finishers.
“I have the best job in the world because I get to work with all my favorite journalists in a tireless quest to speak truth to power and lift Kansans’ voices,” Smith told me Wednesday evening.
I couldn’t agree more.

Further staff members were honored with an array of second-place finishes. Reporter Anna Kaminski received the distinction for her entry in the military story category, while former reporter Rachel Mipro placed for an environmental story. Mipro departed in July, and Kaminski arrived in August. Working with both has been a joy.
Now we come to an eternally tricky piece of any awards story. That would be the writer covering his or her own awards. I placed second for journalist of the year for the second time in a row. In this case, however, I’m right behind Smith. I’m sure I’ll never hear the end of it. I also finished second in editorial writing.
Other Kansas Press Association awards for Kansas Reflector staff included:

New Journalist Award: Third place, Anna Kaminski
Investigative Story: Third place, Sherman Smith
Education Story: Third place, “‘Unapologetically loud’: How student journalists fought a Kansas district over spyware and won,” Sherman Smith
Column Writing: Third place, Clay Wirestone
Column Writing: Third place, Max McCoy
Best Story/Picture Combination: Third place, “Kansas elementary school students plant exclusive sweetgum that traversed the moon,” Sherman Smith
Military Story: Third Place, “Bill protecting Kansans veterans from ‘claim sharks’ vaporized after flat tax failed,” Sherman Smith

Each year I repeat some variant on the journalistic truism that no one does these jobs for awards. The most important recognition I receive comes from our readers, both in person and through email. But only the must curmudgeonly of codgers would refuse such distinction when offered.

Laura Kelly gave the green light to creation of distinctive license plates celebrating National Future Farmers of America and the Route 66 Association of Kansas in addition to introduction of an edgy, sleek and minimalist blackout plate for discriminating motorists.
Sales of the FFA and Route 66 plates, like other nonprofit organizations imprinted on Kansas license plates, directly benefit the respective foundations. Benefactor of the blackout-style plate tied to a special $50 fee would be the Kansas Department of Revenue. The agency said it would earmark fee revenue from blackout plates, which have white lettering on a dark background, to pay costs associated with replacing outdated plates.

“Increasing the options available for distinctive license plates is a simple way to allow Kansans to show off their interests and values on the road,” said Sen. Ethan Corson, a Democrat from Johnson County.
Rep. Shannon Francis, a Republican from Liberal in southwest Kansas, said expansion of the state’s collection of specialty license plates was a chance for Kansans to express support for organizations they cherished. He said the new batch was no exception.


“One plate in this bill supports the Future Farmers of America, an organization that has profoundly impacted generations of Kansans,” Francis said. “FFA plays a crucial role in nurturing leadership skills among youth and preparing them for careers in agricultural science, business and technology.”
On Wednesday, Kelly said enactment of House Bill 2201 would also streamline the process of issuing Kansas license plates. The bill also modified documentation requirements for military license plate applications.


 Pesticide pollution

Meanwhile, Kelly signed House Bill 2169 to clarify state law on remediation of pesticide pollution on commercial property in Johnson County. The legislation resulted from a request from a representative of Astra Enterprise Park, which is home to Panasonic’s $4 billion advance battery production facility in De Soto.
The measure would limit a state agency’s ability to issue soil, groundwater or surface water cleanup orders to owners of non-residential property previously owned by the U.S. Army in Johnson County. The restriction would apply to land where pesticide products were distributed near buildings on Army property prior to 2005. An ammunition plant was in operation at the site for decades, but it is being developed as a large business park.
However, the bill says the property owner would be responsible for soil and water remediation if the property was converted to residential use or for construction of a child-care facility.
In the House, the Kansas Department of Health and Environment testified the bill would restrict the agency from investigating contaminants, lead to inconsistent enforcement standards and could prompt use of the land for residential purposes without restrictions.
Kelly also signed House Bill 2255 to expand acreage of the Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program. The objective was to improve water conservation in the Upper Arkansas River corridor from Hamilton County to Rice County. State-enrolled CREP acres would expand to 60,000 acres from the current 40,000 maximum.
Under the voluntary program, a producer could receive rental payments and other incentives to retire state water rights on enrolled acres. The aggregate total number of acres in all CREPs in a single Kansas county couldn’t exceed 20% of the statewide acreage cap.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Francis-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

It was part of the annual AICUP (Association of Independent Colleges & Universities of Pennsylvania) Day at the Capitol.
They travelled from over 25 schools to help convince lawmakers to continue or increase funding financial aid programs that support students in the state attending private schools like theirs.
“Programs like PHEAA [Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency] and Ready to Succeed are the reason I can stay at my school and have the opportunity to speak on its behalf today,” Dustin McMullen, a 21-year-old Seton Hill student, said in the rotunda. “I stand here today, and I urge policy makers and stakeholders to continue investing in programs like PHEAA and ready to succeed.”
He said the crowd, made up of fellow college students, administrators, lobbyists and journalists, was larger than his class at Rocky Grove high school in Franklin, which graduates around 60 people every year.

McMullen, a first-generation college student, told the Capital-Star that he likely would not have been able to attend college without financial assistance. But with state funding, he’s enrolled in a unique program, the early acceptance medical program, where he’s obtaining a liberal arts degree, with a seat in Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine’s grad program awaiting him when he graduates. His goal is to become an anesthesiologist.
For him, it was important to come to Harrisburg and advocate on his and other schools’ behalf. Before his speech, McMullen and the other students met with lawmakers and legislative staff members to stress the importance of continued financial aid for students attending private college. 
“I’m an RA, a resident assistant, at Seton Hill. So I see residents who struggle with finances, but thanks to these financial aid programs, they’re able to come and get the opportunity that they wouldn’t get at other places.”
Tom Foley, the president of AICUP, which represents 85 schools, stressed the importance of funding education at independent colleges. And part of that, he said, is dispelling myths about the kinds of students private schools attract
“I think most people assume that low income kids are all in publicly-funded schools,” Foley said. “But actually, the majority of them are in these schools.”
According to data provided by AICUP, out of all students working towards bachelor’s degrees in Pennsylvania, 46% of lower-income Pell Grant-eligible students attend independent schools. That also includes  47% of students receiving PHEAA grants, and 52% of underrepresented minority students seeking both bachelor’s and advanced degrees.
Collectively, 275,000 students seeking four-year degrees attend AICUP schools.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Foley said that he doesn’t predict a decline in funding from the state legislature for student financial assistance programs, but is worried about the impacts of the federal government’s moves to slash funding at some universities around the country.
In March, Foley wrote a letter to Pennsylvania’s congressional delegation, warning about the potential impacts of proposed funding cuts to research programs at colleges and universities, including 35 AICUP member schools. Now, he’s worried what will happen to direct student aid.
“We’re very concerned,” he said. “But we can’t tell yet. When they’ve talked about higher education in the new administration, they always say, ‘We’re going to protect Pell Grants. We’re going to protect the student aid programs.’ Hopefully, that is the case.”
Olivia Fabiano, a senior at Elizabethtown College, also made the trip to the Capitol. . 
Like McMullen, for her, this is personal. Fabiano said she likely would not have been able to afford tuition at the school without financial assistance, especially with other college-aged siblings and a brother with costly medical needs.

“I think it’s important for everybody to have that equal opportunity to receive the higher education that they know they deserve,” Fabiano said. “There shouldn’t be a financial burden holding a student back from pursuing any sort of college, or the one that they want to be at.”
She was drawn to Elizabethtown over other state-owned and state-related schools because of the small class sizes. She had been able to attend a private middle school because her mom worked there, and attributed the level of individualized attention she could receive to her social and academic success.
Coming to Harrisburg, Fabiano felt that communicating her lived experience to lawmakers would be more effective than AICUP just providing them with statistics. And it was a chance to see first-hand how the process works. As a marketing student, she hopes to land a job at an advocacy organization, or in government, where she feels that she’s working towards positive change. 
“I’m very interested in doing marketing for something like this, in politics,” Fabiano said. “I’m actually having coffee with someone on [Governor Josh] Shapiro’s communications team because it’s so interesting to me.”
Dashawn Sheffield, another student who travelled to Harrisburg, felt it was important to tell lawmakers how much financial assistance meant to him. He said financial aid programs, like the Ready to Succeed scholarship, along with four jobs on and off campus, are the reason he is able to attend Lafayette College. It was his second year attending an AICUP day at the capital. 
“These grants do not just fund education,” Sheffield told a crowd in the rotunda. “They fuel opportunity, ambition and success.”

Another reason he wanted to be on hand is because of his fascination with politics — he’s double majoring in government and international politics. And, in his spare time, he advocates for campaign finance reform in Pennsylvania.
“I’ve always known I wanted to be a politician of some sort,” Sheffield said. “I am really looking to make a large-scale impact one day.”
For him, two years of coming to Harrisburg to advocate for low-income students like himself helped build that resolve.
“It really strengthened that for me, being able to experience firsthand testifying, giving a speech, and also speaking to the legislators,” Sheffield said. “I’m leaving knowing I was a voice for many different students like me.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3562-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-04-09 19:07:16.246797

(Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)This story originally appeared in the Arizona Mirror.
The leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker. 
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.

Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — State lawmakers are one debate away from adopting two bills backed by Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen meant to increase online safety for minors and curb student phone use at school.
Senators on Wednesday, by voice vote, advanced Legislative Bill 504, the “Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act” by State Sen. Carolyn Bosn of Lincoln. It would require online services to explicitly protect minor users and their personal information in the physical design of certain applications or websites, including social media.
LB 504’s goal is to tackle rising youth social media use and harms such as depression, anxiety, eating disorders, bullying, harassment, stalking, suicide and more.

Bosn, a former deputy county attorney in Lancaster and Saunders Counties and a mother of four young children, said the online services covered under her bill profit off of users’ data, including from screen time, clicks or purchases. She added that families know the importance of bills such as LB 504 and how difficult it is to stay ahead of an “ever-changing online world.”
The bill is about public safety, Bosn explained, comparable to car seats, toddler beds, training wheels, helmets and high chairs.
“We think about safety features in every other product we provide to our most vulnerable,” Bosn said. “So why wouldn’t we make every effort to make kids online safer?”
Specifics of the bill
Under LB 504, “qualified online services” are those that:

Conduct business in Nebraska.
Determine the purposes and means of processing users’ personal information.
Have annual gross revenue over $25 million, adjusted every other year for inflation, at least 50% of which is derived from the sale or sharing of personal user data.
Buy, receive, sell or share the personal information of 50,000 or more consumers, households or devices each year.

Online services with “actual knowledge” that fewer than 2% of users are minors (up to age 18) would be excluded from the act, as would federal, state, tribal or local governments for design features “in the ordinary course of its operations.” 
Should Bosn’s proposal conflict with one or more other laws, “the law that affords the greatest protection from harm to minors shall control.”
State Sens. Terrell McKinney and Margo Juarez, both of Omaha, both spoke in favor of Bosn’s bill and said it was important to have guardrails in place for children.

Juarez, a former school board member for Omaha Public Schools, said she imagined she would have appreciated the guidance if she had dealt with such social media influences when her children were younger.
Children and teens using these online services would need to be treated differently online than adults, requiring easy-to-use and accessible tools, such as for parents up to their child’s 13th birthday, to crack down on:

Screen time.
A minor being able to communicate with other users.
Other individuals being able to see a minor’s personal data.
The operation of all design features, including to opt-out of any “unnecessary” features.
Personalized recommendations, allowing an opt-in for a chronological info stream rather than one based on user activity.
In-game purchases or other transactions, placing limits or prohibiting such activity.
The sharing of the precise geolocation of the minor and providing obvious notice of such tracking.

Targeted advertising of minor users would also be prohibited on qualified online services. So would notifications or push alerts from such online services between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. during the school year, and 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. on weekdays during the school year.
Bosn’s proposal also prohibits “dark patterns” from being used on minors. These are user interfaces “designed or manipulated with the effect of substantially subverting or impairing user autonomy, decision-making or choice.” This could include features that influence user choices often without the awareness of what they are consenting to, such as tracking or targeted ads.
First Amendment concerns
State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, as he did when the bill was first debated in February, said he had “philosophical concerns” but also legal questions over whether LB 504’s requirements would be constitutional under the First Amendment right of free speech.
  State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, center, meets with State Sens. Machaela Cavanaugh and John Cavanaugh, both of Omaha, on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature. July 26, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Dungan’s largest concern was that the bill would require these settings to be default. He cited a recent case in California where a similar law was put on pause.
“I believe that in order to be compliant with the First Amendment, it is important that we not curate the speech that is being made by these private actors,” Dungan said.
Bosn said requiring the default settings would add some “teeth” to the law.
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha, noting he has four children almost the same age as Bosn’s, said he appreciated the changes that Bosn made for the second-round debate as a “step in the right direction.”
Cavanaugh said that while he shared concerns about social media and taking action, he was concerned about “injecting the government from a top-down approach.”
“I think there are concerns people raise [that] young people should be entitled to some level of their own privacy about their thoughts and things like that,” he said. “I don’t know where you draw that line.”
‘Sit this one out’
Bosn said she made multiple changes after talking with opponents, but that while she tried multiple times to work with Dungan and Cavanaugh, they hadn’t engaged. She criticized the duo, who are both attorneys, for saying they agreed with the premise but in effect saying, “We’re just not there yet.”

She called that “a little disingenuous.”
“Maybe you should sit this one out,” Bosn said. “Either have the courage to come and say, ‘These are the changes we want made,’ … or don’t bother.”

Bosn said one senator who previously raised concerns, State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln, worked on the bill before Bosn filed an amended version about one week ago.
“If you’re not going to read it and you’re not going to come and talk with me about your concerns, please don’t stand here and patronize me and say, ‘I really support your efforts,’” Bosn said.
‘Rules of the Constitution’
Bosn said she had removed a main provision of her bill similar to an issue raised in the California case, even though she said she disagreed with those concerns.
That language would have required qualified online services to implement features to prevent compulsive usage, severe psychological harm (including anxiety and depression), severe emotional distress, “highly offensive intrusions on reasonable privacy expectations,” identity theft, discrimination or other injuries.
The amended bill would also no longer require online services to treat all users as a minor without until it is known that the user is not one. Online services would also not be required to issue an annual compliance report.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Dungan said he had to “respectfully dispute” that the Nebraska and California proposals were substantively different and apologized if his concerns had come off as patronizing.
“It still addresses the same underlying issue, which is that it seeks to regulate speech in a way that is overly broad,” Dungan said. 
Dungan said he thought the bill was a “good idea, but, unfortunately, we do have to adhere to the rules of the Constitution.”
An effort by Dungan to remove the “default settings” language from Bosn’s bill failed 26-10 against his amendment. Bosn’s amendments to her bill were approved 45-0.
Student cellphones and social media
LB 504 is one of four proposals backed by Pillen and Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers this spring that addresses online safety for minors.
A second bill, advanced Tuesday by voice vote to a third and final round of debate, LB 140 by State Sen. Rita Sanders of Bellevue, would require each of the state’s 245 public school districts to prohibit student use of personal electronic devices, such as cellphones, on school grounds or at a “school instructional function,” like a field trip. 
Most school districts already have such policies, and districts would retain wide latitude in approving the places and times when such devices could be used.
The other bills are LB 383, from State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman, and LB 172, from State Sen. Brian Hardin of Gering. Storer’s “Parental Rights in Social Media Act” advanced 6-1 from the Bosn-chaired Judiciary Committee, with LB 172 amended in.

LB 383 would prohibit anyone from creating social media accounts without first verifying their age after Jan. 1. One method of age verification could be a digital ID card. Minors (up to age 18) could not create an account without clear parental consent. 
Hardin’s LB 172 would update existing state laws against child sexual abuse material to outlaw computer-generated images of child pornography.
Storer has designated LB 383 as her 2025 priority bill. It hasn’t yet been scheduled for debate.
‘Stand up for our kids’
Bosn’s LB 504 would take effect Jan. 1 if passed. Civil violations could be enforced by the Nebraska AG’s Office, up to $50,000 for each violation. The bill would include funding for a new assistant attorney general, or about $150,000 each full fiscal year.
Companies would have a six-month “grace period” to comply with the act, or until July 1, 2026.
Bosn said “red flags” over youth online activity have been flying from educators, medical professionals, law enforcement, judges, parents, grandparents, guardians and children who she said were acknowledging problems and asking for help. 
Bipartisan groups of lawmakers nationwide have been doing just that, Bosn added.
“This is the time to stand up for our kids,” Bosn said. “This bill is a common sense opportunity for this body to demonstrate the political will to protect Nebraska children online.”

According to students [&#8230;]","KSU students rally to support resource centers branded as DEI. Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderSome Kennesaw State University students say they will lose access to things like free menstrual products, foods from their home country or a sense of belonging at their university if the school follows through with plans to shut down student resource centers, apparently as part of an anti-diversity, equity and inclusion push.
According to students and faculty, programs on the chopping block could include initiatives for LGBTQ students, students of color, women, Latino students and aimed at promoting cultural awareness. The university has held meetings with students to discuss the proposed changes.
The university’s assistant vice president of communications, Tammy DeMel declined to answer emailed questions or clarify which resources may be on the way out, instead sending a statement:
“As KSU works to follow all federal and state regulations and the policies of the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia, we’ll continue to support the needs of all students and help them access the resources they need to succeed.”
Several dozen students gathered on the campus green Wednesday did not feel reassured. Protesters organized by Students for Socialism, and the Party for Socialism and Liberation marched around the school carrying signs and chanting slogans like “Say it loud, say it clear, resource centers will stay here.”
Freshman chemistry major Celeste Vincent said she’s used the resource centers and that they can be a godsend for students who didn’t get support back home, and that attempts to take them away feel hateful.
“Some people, it’s all they have,” she said. “They don’t have family, they don’t have friends, they don’t have the resources to reach out to people. They have this, and they want to take it away. Why? Why? Because they hate them, they hate kids, they hate the new generation. These kids paid good money to be here. They worked their asses off to graduate high school. They come here every day and they pay and they sit in their classes and they try to do their best. And the one support that we get, we’re told, you can’t have that because you’re less than. That’s what it boils down to.”
Grace Blomberg, a student and organizer, said some students feel like they’ve been subjected to a bait and switch.
“Students coming from rural parts of Georgia who in their schools had never seen a pride flag, had experienced lots of aggression, came and did tours and saw a center with pride flags up, and they immediately felt welcome, they immediately felt safe,” she said. “So that, I think, is a major factor in why students might choose KSU, and students are on tours currently right now, KSU may not be disclosing that the centers that they’re passing by won’t be here in the fall when they come to school.”
Other students who did not want their names published out of concern for retribution said the centers have provided them with services like menstrual products, contraception and information on women’s health. Students said the LGBTQ resource center provided clothes for transgender students allowing them to wear things their parents would not approve of, and other centers provide halal foods for Muslims and other foods that could be hard to find in the states.
Some students on the green Wednesday were less attached to the resource centers. Sophomore exercise science major Jack McFadin, who said he proudly voted for President Donald Trump, said he’s not opposed to all of the services the centers provide like counseling for students in need of help, but he said he is strongly opposed to DEI because he says it undermines merit-based achievements.
“I think as far as counseling resources go, I don’t really care because it doesn’t affect me,” he said. “But if it is DEI and it is just giving people scholarships because ‘I identify as this,’ then I think that’s a bad thing for the future of our country.”
In an executive order released in January, President Donald Trump sought to eliminate DEI, including from schools and colleges, calling it a way to peddle “dangerous, demeaning and immoral race- and sex-based preferences.”
Sara Giordano, an assistant professor in KSU’s department of interdisciplinary studies, said some feel like the school administration is caving to the Trump administration without putting up a fight.
“(Students) came back saying, ‘oh, KSU told us their hands are tied, they have to comply, and they’re doing this because of federal and state guidance, federal and state policies,’” Giordano said. “The problem is that none of these policies are in writing. There’s actually nothing that says any of these centers are illegal. These centers serve a lot of our students. Our students are devastated by the threat of them closing.”
“Universities, quite frankly, I think are using this – KSU is using this – as an excuse to close down student centers because of a conservative agenda,” she added.
A statewide ban on DEI in schools failed to pass in this year’s legislative session but could return when lawmakers come back to the Gold Dome in January.

(Photo by Klaus Vedfelt / Getty Images)The State of New Mexico’s inactive rule requiring school districts to have a minimum of 180 instructional days on their calendars per school year is back in the courts.
The New Mexico Public Education Department in March appealed a February decision from Ninth Judicial District Court Judge Dustin K. Hunter, who ruled that the department’s rule requiring a minimum number of instructional days in the calendar was unenforceable. Hunter wrote in his decision that the rule conflicted with a current Public School Code statute that requires instead a minimum number of instructional hours.
Hunter’s ruling came in response to an April 2024 lawsuit from the New Mexico School Superintendents Association and many school boards from across the state challenging PED’s original calendar rule, announced in March 2024. The rule itself was a response to the signing of House Bill 130 during the 2023 session, which requires K-12 schools to have a minimum of 1,140 instructional hours each year. Hunter granted an injunction in that case in May 2024, so the rule has never been enforced.
According to court documents, the state claims the judge erred in several ways in making his decision. First, the appeal contends Hunter was wrong to limit the scope of the department’s rulemaking authority and erroneously used outside evidence to determine legislative intent. The state also asserts in its challenge that no conflict exists between the rule and current statute.
Stan Rounds, executive director of the New Mexico School Superintendents Association, a plaintiff in the original case, told Source NM that their team chose legal counsel to represent them in these next court proceedings just last week and are prepared to respond to the state’s claims over the next several months of the process.
The Legislature attempted to codify the district court’s February decision during the recent session through House Bill 65, which would have clarified that local districts have the authority to set the number of school days in their calendar, as long as it meets the instructional hours requirement.
HB65 passed in both chambers, but Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham vetoed the bill. The House voted to overturn the veto, but the Senate did not reciprocate due to lack of time on the last day of the session, so the governor’s veto still stands. 
Source reached out to the governor’s office for comment on the court proceedings and a spokesperson referred us to the governor’s veto message, which states that Lujan Grisham is concerned with some instances in which school districts have condensed school calendars. Lujan Grisham also mentions concern about “shortchanging” New Mexico students, particularly in light of the landmark Yazzie-Martinez lawsuit, which found that the state was not providing equitable educational opportunities to at-risk students.
“We weren’t surprised that she vetoed [HB65],” Rounds told Source. “There may be other opportunities for [lawmakers] to consider the override at some point in the future.”
Whitney Holland, president of the American Federation of Teachers’ New Mexico chapter, told Source that the back-and-forth on the state education department’s rule is “frustrating” and disregards the intent of current laws. The teacher’s union supported the plaintiffs in the original lawsuit through an amicus brief. She said it feels as though schools, students and teachers are getting caught in the crosshairs of a larger political battle.
“The legislative intent is to give our school districts and our places of learning that local control and that ability. So I think it’s insulting to that,” Holland said. “This kind of back and forth on will we, won’t we…I think it’s really destabilizing a little bit, and it’s hard to do any longterm planning. 
Michael Chavez, superintendent of Hatch Valley Public Schools, told Source that he does not believe more school days lead to better student outcomes but, rather, it’s the quality of instruction that counts. He added that especially in smaller, more rural districts, everything from instructional days and class schedules to transportation is tied together. 
Opponents of longer school years have also raised concerns for rural and tribal schools and the costs associated with added instructional days. 
“It really boils down to how effective is your instruction, what goes on in your classroom on a day-to-day basis,” Chavez said.

(Photo by Alex Kent/Getty Images)The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced Wednesday it would begin screening immigrants’ social media activity for “antisemitism,” formalizing a process it has already used to deport hundreds of international students. 
The Department of Homeland Security, which houses Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), said in a press release that those applying for permanent resident status, international students and non-citizens affiliated with schools “linked to antisemitic activity” would be affected immediately. It would also consider “physical harassment of Jewish individuals.” 
“[Secretary Kristi] Noem has made it clear that anyone who thinks they can come to America and hide behind the First Amendment to advocate for anti-Semitic violence and terrorism – think again. You are not welcome here,” Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary for public affairs, said in a media release. 
First Amendment groups immediately hit back against the announcement. 
“By surveilling visa and green card holders and targeting them based on nothing more than their protected expression, the administration trades America’s commitment to free and open discourse for fear and silence,” the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression, a college free speech organization, posted on social media. “Unfortunately, that chill appears to be the administration’s aim.” 
“When the federal government starts talking about people ‘hiding behind the First Amendment,’ look out,” FIRE attorney Will Creeley added on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter. 
Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced last month the State Department had revoked over 300 student visas from international students, many of whom engaged in pro-Palestine demonstrations that have swept college campuses. 
President Donald Trump’s administration has taken a hard line against universities where students have protested Israel in the nearly 18 months since the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas-led attack in which some 1,200 Israelis and foreign nationals were killed and more than 250 people kidnapped. The incident which kicked off a war between Israel and the extremist organization. Since then, nearly 50,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to the United Nations, mostly women, children and elderly people. 
Trump and other Republicans have painted the largely peaceful protests — and support of Palestine in general — as antisemitic. His administration has threatened 60 universities, including Tulane in New Orleans, with the revocation of federal funding if they fail “to protect Jewish students on campus.” 
Several schools, including Cornell, Princeton and Columbia, have had millions in federal funding paused or revoked in an attempt to influence their campus policy. 
Many of the students arrested had no criminal records, with their attorneys alleging they had been arrested for engaging in peaceful protests. In one case involving a Tufts University student who Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents swarmed and arrested, supporters say her alleged offense was authoring an opinion piece for a student newspaper in favor of Palestinians. 
USCIS will consider social media content that indicates the user “endorsing, espousing, promoting, or supporting antisemitic terrorism, antisemitic terrorist organizations, or other antisemitic activity” in its analysis when considering immigration requests.

Bobby Kauffman, R-Wilton, spoke at a subcommittee meeting Jan. 27, 2025. He and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs introduced an updated version of their property tax proposal following public feedback on the bill. (Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)An overhaul of Iowa’s property tax system would begin sooner and allow local governments to collect more revenue in times of high inflation under updated legislation released Wednesday by the Republican chairmen of the Legislature’s tax-writing committees.
Senate Study Bill 1227, and its companion House Study Bill 328, make changes to House Study Bill 313 and Senate Study Bill 1208, the companion bills introduced in early March by Rep. Bobby Kaufmann, R-Wilton and Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, the chairs of the Ways and Means committees in the House and Senate.
The original legislation, as well as the updated version, would repeal Iowa’s “rollback” system for calculating property taxes, in which only a portion of residential property taxes are taxable. The taxable portion is a percentage of the property’s market value, calculated each year growth of statewide taxable properties and limited by an aggregate value growth of 3%.
The legislation replaces the rollback with a “revenue-restricted” system by allowing taxation of the full assessed value of a property, but limiting the amount of new tax revenues local governments can collect. Most property tax levy rates could increase each year by no more than 2% under the bill, with exceptions for new construction.
While the initial proposal phased out the rollback system over five years, the new bill proposes eliminating this system of calculation immediately, in fiscal year 2027. The new version of the legislation also allows local governments to exceed the 2% limit — allowing up to 5% increases for most property tax levy rates — during times of high inflation, as determined by increases in the consumer price index (CPI).
In a news release, Dawson and Kaufmann stated the property tax proposal includes a “minimum budget guarantee to provide small communities certainty in their budgeting process.” The measure also includes an increase to the homestead property tax exemption benefit from a proposed $25,000 in the initial bill to $50,000.
Some of these changes — like allowing for greater levy rate increases during inflationary periods — were brought up during subcommittee meetings on the legislation by advocates representing local governments. Dawson said the new version of the legislation came out of discussions and suggestions on the original bill.
“When we filed our original bill, we were looking to get it out to the public so we could start receiving feedback and input, and the bill filed today is a result of that feedback,” Dawson said in the release. “… These updated proposals continue our goal of rebuilding the property tax system to bring relief, and bring more predictability and transparency to taxpayers, local governments and businesses.”
Concerns about other portions of the proposal raised by local government representatives, like changes to tax increment financing (TIF) revenues and the shift of $426 million in K-12 schools from property taxes to the state, were not addressed by the amendment, remaining the same in the new legislation.
The new property tax bill has not been scheduled for a subcommittee as of Wednesday. In interviews with reporters and at meetings, Kaufmann has repeatedly stated that his goal is for the measure to pass during the 2025 legislative session, while giving time for feedback and alterations as needed. Republican leaders have echoed this sentiment, while saying that they want to ensure the bill will have its intended impact of lowering property taxes while allowing local governments to continue providing needed services.
Senate President Amy Sinclair told reporters earlier in August that “we want it done right, rather than fast.”
“For me, it’s a priority to get done this session,” Sinclair said. “But if it doesn’t get done this session, it’s because …  we didn’t have all the details in place to get it done right.
Kaufmann said in a statement on the updated property tax bill that the measure will provide needed relief from rising property tax costs.
“With assessment letters coming out, Iowans have been louder than ever with their concerns about property taxes,” Kaufmann said. “Iowans have expressed their concern, rage, and fear about unpredictable increases and their ability to afford staying in their homes. We are working to provide real relief to Iowans and their families, make Iowa a competitive state to live, and deliver a property tax overhaul that focuses on property taxpayers.”",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/kaufmann-scaled-e1738013694429-1024x691.jpg,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)The state’s U.S. attorney is pushing back on the state police chief’s new warning that New Jersey cops can’t help federal immigration officials with civil enforcement.
“Let me be clear: executive orders will be followed and enforced in the state of New Jersey,” Alina Habba, the acting U.S. attorney for New Jersey, said on social media Tuesday.
Habba was taking aim at a March 24 memo from New Jersey State Police Superintendent Col. Pat Callahan telling state police personnel that the New Jersey Immigrant Trust Directive bars police from arresting people solely based on immigration status and prohibits them from sharing information with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
The memo notes the directive differentiates between an administrative warrant, which is issued by a federal agency like ICE, and a judicial warrant, signed by a judge.
“Taking law enforcement action by arresting a subject based solely on an ‘Outstanding Administrative Warrant’ would violate the Attorney General’s Immigrant Trust Directive referenced above,” Callahan said in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by the New Jersey Monitor.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office did not respond for further comment. State Police spokesman Trooper Charles Marchan said the memo “speaks for itself.”
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, he has made detaining and deporting undocumented immigrants a top priority of his second term in the White House. His crackdown on immigration has gone beyond migrants, with more legal permanent residents being detained and facing deportation.
About 27,000 warrants of removal were added to a federal database last month, according to Callahan’s memo. It’s unclear how many of those are for New Jersey residents.
Callahan warned that troopers are not to arrest people for outstanding administrative warrants and to “pay particular attention” to the wording of the warrant to ensure they adhere to the Immigrant Trust Directive.
Since 2018, the Immigrant Trust Directive has limited the information New Jersey police officers can share with federal civil immigration agents. The directive also prevents officers from detaining people based on suspected or actual immigration status and from questioning someone’s status unless relevant to a criminal investigation.
While critics have said the directive amounts to New Jersey providing “sanctuary” status to undocumented immigrants, the directive does not prevent authorities from helping immigration agents detain suspected criminals.
Attorney General Matthew Platkin said the 2018 directive ensures that cops spend their time tackling public safety issues while ensuring victims of and witnesses to crimes feel free to speak to police regardless of their immigration status. He added the directive was drafted in cooperation with chiefs of police and county prosecutors.
“Under the Immigrant Trust Directive, state and local law enforcement have and will continue to work with federal authorities to remove violent criminals from this country. Plain and simple, there is no ‘sanctuary’ for criminals in New Jersey,” Platkin said in a statement.
Activists have been pushing New Jersey lawmakers to pass the Immigrant Trust Act, which would codify the directive and other protections for undocumented immigrants. The bill would require the attorney general to develop policies on so-called sensitive locations like health care facilities and public schools where assisting immigration authorities would be barred.
The bill has not yet been heard by a legislative committee, and leadership has not commented on plans to advance it.
The Trump administration has announced plans to open a new immigration detention facility in Newark this summer, which the city is fighting in court.

Mike Rounds, R-South Dakota, re-introduced his bill Wednesday to eliminate the federal Department of Education and move “all critical federal programs” to other departments. 
Rounds introduced similar legislation in November, during the prior session of Congress.
President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March directing U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon to dismantle her department and “return education authority to the states.” The move followed a 50% reduction in department staff.
Trump signs order directing Education secretary to shut down her own department

Ultimately, only Congress — which established the 46-year-old department — has the authority to eliminate it.
Rounds sent a press release saying his legislation would not cut any education funding. He said some funds would flow to states as block grants while other programs would be funded through other federal agencies. He said eliminating the department’s “bureaucracy” would save the federal government approximately $2.2 billion annually.
“We all know that teachers, parents, local school boards and state Departments of Education know what’s best for their students, not bureaucrats in Washington,” Rounds said in the release.
Additionally, under Rounds’ legislation:

Schools would no longer be required to administer standardized assessments or track performance for identifying struggling schools, which Rounds said would allow “for more flexibility in assessment and school improvement strategies.”
Schools would no longer have to “comply with complex Title I funding regulations” (Title I funding supports schools with high numbers of low-income students), or “maintenance of effort standards or provide equitable services for private school students,” according to Rounds, who said that would “simplify financial management.”
“Schools would have more autonomy to set teacher certification standards and professional development plans, reducing federal oversight and allowing for tailored approaches to educator qualifications,” Rounds said.

Earlier this year, when Trump moved to dismantle the federal department, some public education advocates in South Dakota reacted negatively.
“If you close down the Department of Education without a plan for ensuring that programs like Title I and special education services continue, then what happens to the students who depend on them?” said Sandra Waltman, director of public affairs for the South Dakota Education Association.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)On April 3, Xiaotian Liu was continuing research for his computer science doctorate at Dartmouth College. On April 4, he was informed by the college that he needed to stop.
The college had run a check on Xiaotian’s F-1 student immigration status and discovered something unusual: Without warning, his status had been revoked. Without the status, Xiaotian could not continue with his work. 
Five days later, that decision has been halted, temporarily, after a federal judge in New Hampshire said Wednesday she would block the Trump administration’s apparent revocation of the status. 
But it remains unclear why the student’s immigration status was revoked in the first place — and whether the change in status was intentional or accidental.
Xiaotian sued the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire to block that change, arguing it had deprived him of due process rights by not informing him of the change or allowing him to respond. After a hearing Wednesday morning, Judge Samantha Elliott said she would issue a temporary restraining order against the department, which would reverse the change in status for two weeks. 
The same court will hold a hearing in the next two weeks on a much more extensive motion for a preliminary injunction against the status change. 
Xiaotian is one of two Dartmouth students to see their immigration status changed last week — and one of nearly 300 students across the country in recent days, according to the New York Times. 
The F-1 status is given to international students to allow them to complete their studies at an American college or university. It is different from an entry visa; there is currently no indication that Xiaotian’s visa has been revoked.
Representatives of the Department of Homeland Security did not inform Xiaotian that his immigration status had been changed, according to his attorneys. He learned of the change on Friday, after the college informed him of it after reviewing its records, they said. 
The doctoral student is being represented by the American Civil Liberties Union of New Hampshire and Ronald Abramson of Shaheen & Gordon. 
Because Xiaotian has lost his status, he has had to pause his Ph.D. research and is no longer receiving compensation for his work, his attorneys said in court Wednesday. He is also fearful of being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, as other students have been, his attorneys said. 
On March 25, a video of a Tufts student, Rumeysa Ozturk, being detained on the street in Somerville, Mass., by ICE officers sparked alarm among immigration advocates and students, and fueled protests. 
A lawyer for the U.S. Attorney’s Office, Raphael Katz, argued the court should not issue the restraining order because Xiaotian had not established that he would suffer “immediate and irreparable harm” if the court did nothing. Katz said Xiaotian could continue attending classes at Dartmouth College, even if he can’t continue his research. And he said Xiaotian could transfer his credits to a university outside of the U.S. if he wanted.
Katz said he could not provide the court information about why Xiaotian’s status was changed or confirm whether Xiaotian’s status was even changed. He said he was still awaiting information from the Department of Homeland Security. 
“I don’t have the facts to establish why the change in status happened,” he said in court.
“At this point, can you tell me whether this was intentional or a mistake?” Elliott asked. Katz said he could not. 
And Katz declined to tell the court whether there was a risk that Xiaotian might be detained. 
“Unfortunately, the government can’t make any representation on its enforcement priorities,” he said. 
Elliott said that plaintiffs had sufficiently shown that there is irreparable harm. 
“He’s not getting paid; he’s not working toward his Ph.D.,” she said.
In making their case, attorneys for Xiaotian stressed the unusual nature of the government’s action. Typically, colleges and universities will monitor their own international students and recommend to the federal department if a student’s F-1 status should be revoked. That arrangement — where schools police their own students — has been the case under the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System, or SEVIS, which was created in 2003 in response to the September 11 attacks.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)
“What typically happens is that the status change is at the initiative of the university, because the university becomes aware of the fact, for example, that a student is no longer in school, (or) the student has dropped out,” said Gilles Bissonnette, legal director of the ACLU of New Hampshire, at a press conference after the hearing. “This reverse situation is what’s incredibly novel and unique, and it’s one of the reasons why there’s not a lot of legal authority out here on this with respect to case law.” 
In Xiaotian’s case, DHS has provided no explanation for the halt. In court, Kim noted he had no criminal record. 
“The plaintiff hasn’t committed any crime,” said SangYeob Kim, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of New Hampshire. “Not even a parking ticket. He doesn’t even own a car.” 
It is not immediately clear when the hearing for Xiaotian’s preliminary injunction motion will take place, but attorneys said they expected it within the next week. 
Attorneys for the Department of Homeland Security are expected to show up at that hearing to make the government’s case, Katz said. 
The New Hampshire lawsuit is one of several waged across the country by students who also had their F-1 status abruptly terminated. Two students at two different colleges in California are suing the department. And one student in Pennsylvania has initiated a class-action lawsuit, seeking to represent all people whose F-1 status has been revoked because of criminal charges that do not interfere with students’ “normal progress toward completion of a course of study.” 
At the press conference, Bissonnette did not comment on whether the ACLU has been in contact with the second Dartmouth student whose F-1 status was reportedly revoked. 
But he said that regardless of Elliott’s ruling, each affected student will likely need to sue the government independently in order to reverse the status change. But he said a favorable district court ruling could set a precedent that others could follow.
And Abramson noted the revocation of the F-1 status came despite no apparent criminal violation. 
“The presidential campaign and the messaging coming out of the administration has been that we’re going to focus on serious criminals and that that’s the problem with immigration in this country,” said Abramson. “This sort of process, and the fact that we have to expend nonprofit resources, private resources, government resources to respond to this situation flies in the face of that and makes us have to question if that’s really the motivation here at all.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NH-Federal-Courthouse-1024x721.jpg,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Lawyers for immigration rights activist Jeanette Vizguerra, who was detained by federal authorities last month, allege in a new court filing that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement retaliated against Vizguerra in response to her constitutionally protected speech and protest.
They filed an amended habeas corpus petition in U.S. District Court of Colorado on Wednesday challenging Vizguerra’s detention. They argue that ICE targeted Vizguerra, who also goes by Vizguerra-Ramirez, because of her national prominence and critiques of the Trump administration’s policies and tactics.
“There are strong indications that ICE’s enforcement actions against Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez were driven, to a large degree, by a desire for retaliation due to her prominence as a critic of Trump immigration policies, and to send a message to other potential critics,” lawyer Laura Lichter wrote.

Lichter requested an opportunity to amend the petition, which was first filed immediately following Vizguerra’s arrest, during a status conference last month. The federal government has 21 days to respond, and a hearing will likely then be scheduled. In the meantime, Vizguerra, a 53-year-old Denver resident whose home country is Mexico, will remain in custody at a private ICE facility in Aurora, as Judge Nina Wang has precluded immigration authorities from deporting her until she gets a hearing over her detention.
We got you
The amended petition contends that when she was placed in shackles and photographed during her arrest, an ICE officer said, “We finally got you.”
“The reason ICE was glad they finally ‘got’ Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez appears to be tied to her long history as an immigration and labor activist,” Lichter wrote.
The Denver ICE office posted that photo of Vizguerra in handcuffs and a belly chain on its X account. A few days later, the main ICE account amplified the post and wrote that “Despite her being featured in national media for years, we arrested her in public March 17. A high-profile status does not exempt a person from immigration law.” The petition notes that it was unique for ICE to highlight Vizguerra’s activism and national prominence in their post when compared to the hundreds of other posts announcing immigration arrests.
Tricia McLaughlin, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the Department of Homeland Security, posted on X on March 19 that ICE will arrest “illegal aliens regardless of if they were a featured ‘Time Person of the Year.'” Vizguerra was named one of the 100 most influential people by Time Magazine in 2017 after she took sanctuary in a Denver church to avoid deportation during the first Trump administration.
The petition also notes posts from former ICE Denver field director John Fabbricatore that celebrated Vizguerra’s arrest and displayed screenshots of Vizguerra’s Facebook posts that were critical of Trump.
Targeting Vizguerra for detention because of her activism violates her First and Fifth Amendment rights, Lichter argued.
“The way Respondents publicly celebrated their apprehension of Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez, and substantially compromised her ability to have a fair hearing on her claim for persecution-based protections, is likely to chill the speech of other immigrants opposed to the government’s immigration policies and practices,” the petition reads.
The amended petition also includes details about repeated attempts from immigration authorities to conduct a so-called “reasonable fear interview” with Vizguerra without her lawyer present. Those interviews happen during immigration proceedings to determine if a removal would cause harm to the immigrant.
The petition alleges that authorities tried to interview Vizguerra four times between March 18 and March 27 without giving advance notice to her lawyer. They gave notice and tried again on March 31, even though Lichter requested that any interview happen after pending litigation or not until she could be physically present with Vizguerra. Lichter has not heard back from ICE over her concerns.
“These actions — taken while Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez remains in ICE custody and under ongoing judicial protection — reflect a broader strategy to bypass meaningful review despite unresolved jurisdictional and constitutional claims. They constitute retaliation,” the petition reads.
Detention of critics
Vizguerra has lived in the United States since 1997. She was arrested in 2009 for having a fake ID and driving without insurance and was placed in removal proceedings. An immigration judge offered her the option of voluntary departure in 2011, which Vizguerra appealed. She then left the country in 2012 to see her dying mother in Mexico and reentered the United States without authorization in 2013. She was sentenced to ICE supervision and has been granted multiple stays of removal since then, the last of which expired last year.
The federal government argues that her order of removal was reinstated in 2013 when she came back to the United States and is still valid. Her lawyers contend, however, that ICE officials issued that order improperly, without letting her know about its existence and letting her raise an objection to it before it was signed.
“The procedural error was not immaterial. Had Ms. Vizguerra-Ramirez been notified of the possibility of a reinstatement order, she could have alerted officials to the fact that she did not have a prior removal order. Instead, she had a grant of voluntary departure that was issued in lieu of a removal order, and by leaving the U.S. while her appeal was pending, she necessarily complied with the order’s departure deadline and did not leave under an order of removal. Absent a prior removal order, there was nothing to be reinstated in 2013,” the petition reads.
Vizguerra’s case comes amid detentions of other immigrants who have protested or criticized the government, including former Columbia student Mahmoud Khalil and Tufts University Ph.D. student Rumeysa Ozturk.

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A bill that would require children to be toilet trained before entering pre-K has failed in a House vote.
The House Common Education Committee struck down Senate Bill 382 by vote of 8-3 on Wednesday.
The bill would have permitted public schools to temporarily withdraw a student after three or more soiling incidents until the child is toilet trained. Schools also could connect families with toilet training resources. 
Students with disabilities would have been exempt from the rule.
The legislation from Sen. David Bullard, R-Durant, and Rep. Marilyn Stark, R-Bethany, passed almost unanimously through the full Senate. Bullard said a lack of toilet training puts “an undue burden on the schools.”
But, a bipartisan group of House lawmakers opposed it on Wednesday. The committee panned the bill without discussion nor debate.
Rep. Ellen Pogemiller, D-Oklahoma City, said after the meeting that the bill could impact children who haven’t yet been recognized as having a disability. Some children aren’t identified for disability assistance until after they are enrolled in school, she said.
Toileting resistance is more common among young children who have autism or developmental delays, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
“That bill wasn’t going to help the kids that need it most,” Pogemiller said.
Also on Wednesday, the committee advanced a bill with an 8-3 vote that would ban students from using cellphones in public schools for a year. Senate Bill 139 would allow districts to decide whether to keep the cellphone ban in place after the 2025-26 school year.
A similar bill that originated in the House passed through the Senate Education Committee the day before. House Bill 1276 would require districts to implement a policy restricting cellphone use during the school day, but it would allow local school boards to opt out and continue permitting cellphones if they wish.
Lawmakers from both chambers now will have to negotiate which bill language they prefer to send to the governor’s desk.

Free.,Two federal judges block Trump administration deportations under Alien Enemies Act,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/two-federal-judges-block-trump-administration-deportations-under-alien-enemies-act,,"WASHINGTON — Federal judges in Texas and New York Wednesday temporarily halted the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 in parts of those two states where Venezuelans set for deportation are incarcerated.The American Civil Liberties Union filed cases in the Southern District of New York and the Southern District of Texas, after the U.S. Supreme Court this week deemed challenges to the wartime law must be brought in the location of those subject to President Donald Trump’s proclamation on use of the act. The cases earlier were argued in the District of Columbia.That Monday decision from the high court lifted a lower court’s order that barred the Trump administration from invoking the wartime law to deport any Venezuelan nationals 14 or older who are suspected gang members — but the justices also said unanimously that the Venezuelans must be allowed court hearings.Texas Judge Fernando Rodriguez Jr. issued a temporary restraining order to prevent the deportation of Venezuelans in the entire state of Texas under the Alien Enemies Act, as well as the facility where the three men who brought the case are currently detained, the El Valle Detention Center in Raymondville.The restraining order from Rodriguez Jr. is in place until April 23. The order also states that the three Venezuelan men cannot be removed from the El Valle Detention Center, which is the same center from which the Trump administration on March 15 transferred those subject to the wartime law and placed them on a plane to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador.New York orderThe temporary restraining order from New York Judge Alvin K. Hellerstein that he plans to sign Wednesday would cover Venezuelans in the Southern District of New York, according to The Associated Press. That would include New York City, the boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx and Dutchess, Orange, Putnam, Rockland, Sullivan and Westchester counties.  Two Venezuelans brought the suit in the Southern District of New York.Hellerstein, who was appointed by former President Bill Clinton, will hold an April 22 hearing to determine if the temporary restraining order should become a preliminary injunction. The ACLU is also pushing for a class certification.The Supreme Court said this week it will allow, for now, the Trump administration to use the Alien Enemies Act, but those subject to the proclamation must be allowed to bring a challenge in court.The original suit against the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act came from five men detained in Texas. The justices argued that the proper court venue should be where they were being detained in Texas rather than before the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. More than 238 Venezuelans have been deported to the brutal prison, Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, known as CECOT.Marylander's case citedJudge Rodriguez Jr., whom President Donald Trump appointed in 2017, in placing the temporary restraining order noted that anyone who is erroneously deported under the Alien Enemies Act potentially cannot be returned to the United States.In his reasoning, he cited the Trump administration’s stance in a high-profile case that led to a Maryland man being sent to a prison in El Salvador by mistake.The Trump administration has asked the Supreme Court to strike down a lower court’s order that officials return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia of Beltsville, Maryland, who had a 2019 court order barring his removal to El Salvador. On Monday the Supreme Court temporarily paused the deadline until the high court could make a full decision.“Furthermore, if the United States erroneously removed an individual to another country based on the Proclamation, a substantial likelihood exists that the individual could not be returned to the United States,” Rodriguez Jr. wrote.A hearing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in the Brownsville division, is set for Friday 1:30 p.m. Central. Rodriguez said of the upcoming Friday hearing, “the Court will consider whether to extend the temporary restraining order or issue other forms of emergency relief.”",,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

James Tipton speaks to students after chairing a Mach 4 meeting of the House Committee on Postsecondary Education that became the subject of an open meetings challenge. (Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)
Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman’s office has ruled that a House committee violated the state open meetings law but the attorney general does not have the authority to determine if the committee also violated legislative procedures. 
The opinion is a response to an open meetings complaint filed by James Orlick, a graduate student at the University of Louisville, who opposed a bill ending diversity, equity and inclusion in Kentucky higher education. Orlick, who presented his complaint to House Speaker David Osborne and committee chair Rep. James Tipton, questioned the legality of a vote on a title amendment to House Bill 4.
At the end of a contentious committee meeting on March 4, Tipton, a Taylorsville Republican, adjourned the House Committee on Postsecondary Education before it had taken the necessary procedural step of approving a title amendment to the measure. Tipton called for the dispersing lawmakers to vote on the title amendment, which they did. Title amendments are required to ensure the title of a bill approved by a committee accurately reflects the contents of the legislation.
The attorney general’s opinion released Wednesday said the committee violated the open meetings law by not responding to Orlick’s complaint within three business days as required by state law. Orlick took the issue to the attorney general’s office after not receiving a response. 
“In this appeal, the Appellant (Orlick) asks the Office to determine whether the Committee may reconvene a meeting — immediately after the chairman announced the meeting was adjourned — to complete the Committee’s business it inadvertently had not finished,” the opinion said. “Thus, in effect, the Appellant asks the Office to determine the legality of the procedures used by a standing committee of the General Assembly. This the Office cannot do.” 
The opinion also says that if the Attorney General did have jurisdiction over the matter, its ruling would be moot as the title amendment was later added during the legislative process. The Senate added the title amendment when it debated the bill. 
The General Assembly ultimately put HB 4 into law after overriding a veto from Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear. 
Attorney general opinions do carry the weight of law and can be appealed to the appropriate circuit court. Orlick told the Kentucky Lantern Wednesday afternoon that he was considering other legal options. 
Orlick said he feels “some relief” that the opinion noted the legislature violated the open meetings law, but was concerned about the office’s opinion that it lacked jurisdiction over the matter. 
“I think this is a very interesting and concerning issue that now the attorney general is saying that (he) doesn’t have jurisdiction,” he said. “So who’s going to hold them accountable? Just trust the Kentucky legislature to police themselves and they violate laws? I think this is a dangerous and a slippery slope for any kind of democracy, even on the state level, too.” 
Laura Leigh Goins, a spokesperson for the House Republican Caucus, said in a statement “the committee failed to adopt a title amendment, but afterward recognized that its attempt to fix the oversight did not comply with its rules.” Thus, the Senate added the title amendment, which was adopted by both chambers, “ensuring that it was done in compliance with the legislative rules and the Open Meetings Act.” 
“Ultimately, as the opinion recognizes, the issue was identified early by lawmakers and staff and addressed immediately with an appropriate remedy,” she said. “The Speaker’s Office is taking additional steps to ensure members, particularly committee chairs and vice chairs, avoid similar situations in the future.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3368-1024x667.jpeg,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

People visiting the gulf beach at Grand Isle State Park endorsed the switch. (Photo by Julie O’Donoghue/Louisiana Illuminator)The Florida Senate passed two bills on Wednesday that replace all references in state statutes to the Gulf of Mexico with the “Gulf of America,” and those measures will now soon go to the governor’s office for his likely signature.
That’s despite the fact that public opinion polls consistently show that the name change isn’t popular with the public.
One measure (SB 1058), sponsored by Sarasota Republican Joe Gruters, requires state agencies to update geographical materials to reflect the new federal designation of the Gulf of Mexico as the “Gulf of America.” Public school and charter school instructional materials and library center collections adopted or acquired on or after July 1 of this year must reflect the new federal designation.
The other proposal (HB 575) calls for all state and local references to the Gulf of Mexico to be changed to the “Gulf of America,” and was sponsored in the Senate by Pinellas County Republican Nick DiCeglie.
While Pinellas County Democrat Darryl Rouson make a joking reference when he asked whether DiCeglie would consider renaming the measure the “Gulf of Americas” that would include North America, South America, Central America, and actress America Ferrera, South Florida Democrat Lori Berman didn’t think it was a laughing matter at all.
She called the legislation a “waste of time,” saying that it “would not improve the lives of our constituents, nor will it advance our state’s economic, educational, or environmental policies.”
“We are spending taxpayer dollars and legislative time on a symbolic gesture, and offers no tangible benefits,” she said. “We are prioritizing a superficial display of nationalism over the pressing needs of the district we represent.”
DiCeglie responded by calling it a “patriotic bill,” and a nod to American exceptionalism.
The passage of these two bills follow President Donald Trump’s an executive order  in February replacing all federal references to the “Gulf of Mexico” with the “Gulf of America.”
A Fox News survey of nearly 1,000 voters conducted last month showed that 67% opposed renaming the body of water located on the southeastern periphery of the North American continent. Other polls similarly show that the name change isn’t popular.
A majority of Florida respondents — 58% — said that they also oppose the idea strongly or somewhat, and only 31% expressed support for the renaming, according to a public opinion survey of 871 registered voters from the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab conducted in February.
DeSantis began using the term “Gulf of America” going back to an executive order he signed back in January.

(Photo courtesy of New Jersey Senate)New Jersey’s top environmental official alleged Wednesday that opponents of proposed rules meant to address rising flood risks along New Jersey’s coast have repeatedly lied in an effort to spur worry among local officials in hopes of waylaying the changes.
Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette told the Assembly Budget Committee that opposition to what’s known as the resilient environments and landscapes rule proposal is driven by a coordinated misinformation campaign.
“It’s not that they’re misinterpreting,” LaTourette said of local officials opposed to the rules. “It’s that there was a very deliberate campaign that constructed a narrative, sent that narrative to every local elected official because they knew if they got the elected officials scared and could sow distrust of the DEP — your floodplain manager who wants to help people — they knew they would then get to you.”
The 1,044-page rules proposal in question would set higher elevation requirements for new construction, update standards for certain infrastructure and new residential buildings in areas that stand to be affected by rising sea levels, and update recordkeeping of certain permits, among numerous other changes. State officials are expected to decide whether to move forward with the changes by the end of the summer.
Opponents ranging from business and construction trade groups to local and county officials allege the rules proposal would entirely prohibit the construction of affordable housing in some Jersey Shore communities, limit residents’ ability to improve their properties, and spike development costs in regulated areas.
Ray Cantor, chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, is one of the critics of the proposed changes.
“To hear Commissioner LaTourette tell it today, this 1,000-page-plus rule is much ado about nothing. We find that’s irresponsible,” Cantor said in a statement. “While he continues to dismiss these concerns, we will continue to amplify why they represent the next major affordability shoe to drop in New Jersey if these rules are finalized as proposed.”
The rules would require new buildings in inundation risk zones — areas that would be at risk of permanent or daily flooding as a result of sea level rise over the next 75 years — to be elevated 5 feet (or, as LaTourette put it Wednesday, “plus-five”).
LaTourette, who acknowledged his frustration during exchanges with lawmakers at Wednesday’s hearing, said opponents have overstated the impact of the proposed elevation requirements because numerous municipalities enacted elevation rules stricter than those required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.
“The local governments who know their communities best didn’t think the FEMA standards were enough then, and so some communities have a plus-two or a plus-three. The plus-five is not on top of that, so in most coastal communities, we’re talking about two or three [feet],” he said.
Some lawmakers questioned whether local officials’ opposition to the rule changes is the result of being hoodwinked by misinformation.
“Respectfully, commissioner, municipalities who have dealt in these areas for hundreds of years, they’re not so easily duped by some special interest with nefarious intentions. They live and breathe this,” said Assemblyman Gerry Scharfenberger (R-Monmouth).
The state proposal would also eliminate permits-by-rule and replace them with permits-by-registration in most cases and with permits-by-certification in others.
The change would be purely for bookkeeping reasons, LaTourette said. Previously, property improvements made under a permit-by-rule were recorded nowhere and could be used as a basis to deny flood insurance payouts, he said.
Like other department heads, LaTourette warned of uncertainty surrounding federal funding amid the Trump administration’s efforts to curtail spending.
The Department of Environmental Protection anticipates it will spend roughly $1.1 billion in federal dollars for the fiscal year that begins July 1, and the commissioner warned a reduction of that funding could imperil flood insurance, water infrastructure, and beach replenishments where the federal government covers 75% of costs.
The nature of the department’s work, LaTourette said, means money lost because of federal cuts would likely have to be reclaimed through tax hikes, whether at the state or local level.
“We can’t not make those improvements. People’s health and the ability to flush our toilets is on the line,” LaTourette said. “So, what would happen? Raising rates on New Jerseyans, that’s what would happen. It’s the only thing that would happen because we can’t not have clean, flowing water and toilets that flush.”

Pat Pettey of Kansas City lauds signing of bill helpful to equipping law enforcement officers with medication to treat fentanyl overdoses.,"Kansas City Democratic Sen. Pat Pettey, left, praised signing by Gov. Laura Kelly of bill helpful to equipping law enforcement officers with medication to treat fentanyl overdoses. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill unanimously approved by the Kansas Legislature repealing a statute inhibiting the ability of law enforcement to obtain emergency medication to reverse the effect of opioid overdoses.
The Democratic governor said Senate substitute for Senate Bill 193 would benefit Kansans by doing away with a mandate law enforcement agencies employ a medical director or licensed pharmacist when dealing with naloxone, also known as Narcan, that could be administered to people suffering fentanyl poisoning.
The cost of complying with state protocol set in 2017, along with the ongoing health-care workforce shortage, inhibited smaller law enforcement agencies that wanted to outfit personnel with doses of naloxone. Under the new law, lifesaving medication would be available to law enforcement as an over-the-counter item.
“We know that addiction does not discriminate,” Kelly said. “I’m proud to sign this bipartisan bill into law so that communities of all sizes can implement this commonsense policy and prevent Kansans from feeling the devastating impacts of fatal overdoses.”
In 2023, the Legis­lature approved a bill signed by Kelly that legalized fentanyl test strips to help Kansans avoid opioid overdoses. Kelly signed good-Samaritan legislation last year to extend protection to individuals providing aid during a drug-use medical emergency.
The number of overdose deaths in Kansas resulting from opioids, including fentanyl, dropped 17% from 497 fatalities in 2022 to 414 in 2023.
The bill signed by Kelly was introduced by former Topeka police chief Ed Klumpp on behalf of the Kansas Association of Chiefs of Police, Kansas Peace Officers Association and Kansas Sheriffs Association.
Sen. Pat Pettey, D-Kansas City, said the bipartisan legislation “breaks down roadblocks” so officers were more likely to be equipped with naloxone.
The reform should have an immediate impact on overdose survival because seconds mean the difference between life and death, said Sen. William Clifford, a Garden City Republican and former emergency medical technician.
“The opioid epidemic has cost thousands of our fellow Kansans their lives. This commonsense fix will empower our first responders throughout our state to save lives,” he said.
 
Newborn screening
On Wednesday, Kelly also signed House substitute for Senate Bill 126 to establish a universal newborn screen program administered by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment. With parental consent, Kansas screens newborns for 36 of 38 treatable conditions at no cost. A KDHE representative said there were plans to add the two additional conditions to the screening protocol.
The bill also raised the minimum state financial aid to local health departments from $7,000 per year to $12,000 per year.
Rep. Brett Fairchild, R-St. John, was the only member of the Legislature to vote against the bill because he objected to a provision increasing the annual assessment on certain hospitals.
“Even though this is a tax that the hospitals impose on themselves, I still view this as technically being a tax increase. When I ran for office, I pledged that I would never vote in favor of a tax increase,” he said.
Kelly also signed Senate Bill 199 to authorize sale of fireworks throughout the year and establish procedures for retailers to engage in permanent rather than seasonal sales. She placed into law House Bill 2280 to make certain any person declared a veteran by an act of Congress was likewise considered a veteran under Kansas law.
She put a signature to Senate Bill 44, which declared antisemitism contrary to public policy of Kansas. In March, House Republicans blocked an attempt by Democratic Rep. Valdenia Winn of Kansas City to amend the bill to condemn all forms of racism and discrimination.
Under House Bill 2313, Kelly’s signature meant state computer systems couldn’t use artificial intelligence platforms controlled by countries considered foreign adversaries of the United States. In addition, the bill banned medical or research facilities from using genetic technology produced by foreign adversaries.
Senate Bill 50 signed by Kelly created uniform interest rates for college scholarships attached to a post-graduation service requirements. She signed Senate Bill 42 to create for law enforcement a real-time online insurance verification system for motor vehicles.
Kelly endorsed House Bill 2342 to permit the Kansas Department of Commerce and Kansas Department of Labor to initiate criminal history background checks when reviewing final applicants for sensitive positions at those agencies.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P3050439-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 18:08:56.995457

SB 112, the main budget bill sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would increase the education budget for the fiscal year 2026, which begins October 1, by $543.3 million, or 5.81%, to $9.89 billion.  
“We’re still in a good place with resources for our public educational institutions, be they universities, colleges, junior colleges, and K-12, Pre-K and other elements,” Orr said, though he added that they have “to be very mindful going forward” not only due to future economic uncertainty but also because of efforts to create a new funding formula.
The budget includes $9.6 million to fund a new parental leave law for state and education employees, as well as $15.6 million for an injury compensation program for education employees awaiting legislative approval. The budget also appropriates $2.5 million for a pilot project to provide teletherapy, or mental health counseling via phone or video, in schools and increased funding for prison education by $3.7 million, or a 19.3% increase, for a total of $22.8 million.

“We know that there’s a lot of mental health challenges in our schools today. Well, there are companies that do via video telecounseling, and because it’s so hard, as you heard in the committee, to find school counselors, this will be an assist,” Orr said.
The Alabama Math, Science, and Technology Initiative (AMSTI) would receive an increase of 31%, increasing it’s funding by $32.2 million under the Senate committee substitute. The Alabama Reading Initiative’sfunding would increase by 6.4% percent, a $9 million increase. Transportation funding would be increased by about 9.1%, or about $40 million. 
The state’s share that it pays for state and education employees is also increasing. PEEHIP would have to contribute $904 to each education employee’s health insurance premiums, up fron $800, while SEIB would have to contribute $1,025 to their state employee’s health insurance premiums. The Alabama Public Library Service would keep their funding level from the current fiscal year.
The budget does not include a $100 million supplemental appropriation to transition the state’s student funding formula to a hybrid model from the Education Opportunities Reserve Fund for the same fiscal year. SB 111, also sponsored by Orr, would appropriate $375 million over three years for that transition, which aims to get more money to students with particular needs, including children in poverty and English Language Learners. 
The committee also approved SB 113, sponsored by Orr, which appropriates an additional $524.3 million to schools in the current fiscal year, which ends on Sept. 30. That includes $100 million to local school boards for new school buses and $166 million to the State Department of Education for one-time expenses, such as college and career readiness grants and providing additional school safety training and services. 
Orr said that higher education institutions received additional funding in the supplemental to keep the current funding ratio between K-12 and higher education due to an increase from the student funding formula changes.
“Colleges and universities usually get around 25%, 27% of whatever the K-12 world gets, so they’re going to be getting additional resources in this budget because we remove $375 [million] from the savings account [and] put it towards K-12,” Orr said.
SB 114, also sponsored by Orr, is another supplemental appropriation bill that would allocate $1.25 billion from the Education Trust Fund Advancement and Technology Fund for the current fiscal year, ending September 30. That supplemental also includes about $908 million for the Department of Education to be distributed to local school boards and other education state entities, such as the Board of Trustees of the Alabama Institute for Deaf and Blind and the Board of Youth Services School Districts.
The committee also approved separate funding bills for Tuskegee University, totaling $15.8 million, Talladega College with $1.33 million, and Southern Preparatory Academy, a boarding school in Camp Hill, totaling $450,000.
Orr said he expects the Senate to consider the funding bills Thursday.

Wilson ran for the Supreme Court last fall against now-Justice Judge Katherine Bidegaray, who replaced Dirk Sandefur on the bench. Wilson garnered 254,294 votes in the statewide race, but lost the election by about eight percentage points.
Now, Wilson will be seeking the seat currently held by Justice Beth Baker, who will not seek reelection. Wilson is the first candidate to announce for the Supreme Court race nearly 18 months ahead of the election.

“As a native Montanan and a conservative, I firmly believe Supreme Court Justices must apply the law and the constitution as written to all their rulings.  As your next Montana Supreme Court Justice, I pledge to follow that guiding conservative principle. I will not be beholden to any special interest group’s agenda, and recognize that the court’s role is to interpret the law as written – not create it,” Wilson said in a written statement.
Baker was elected to the Supreme Court in 2010, and won reelection to her seat in 2018. She confirmed to the Daily Montanan that she will not seek a third eight-year term.
“I think it’ll be time for some new energy,” Baker said. “I’ve still got almost two full years left, and I want to be able to give my full effort for the rest of my term. It is a tremendous honor to serve the Montana justice system.”
Wilson worked as a a prosecutor in Great Falls after graduating from law school in Minnesota and has served as a district court judge in Flathead County since 2017.
His campaign announcement highlighted a 2020 ruling he made striking down then-Gov. Steve Bullock’s mask mandate made during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The 2026 election cycle will be the first following the Legislature’s passage of House Bill 39, which allows political parties to donate to judicial candidates.
During his 2024 campaign, Wilson was “strongly recommended” by the Flathead County Republican Central Committee, and received campaign contributions from the Stillwater Republican Central Committee, according to campaign finance reports.
He was also endorsed by the Montana Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed current Chief Justice Cory Swanson’s campaign. Swanson won his race by roughly eight percentage points.

Polk County Republican Sen. Colleen Burton has led the charge in attempting to place some restrictions on these intoxicating products, which have emerged since the state legalized hemp in 2019. Since then, some states have banned all such products, while others have heavily regulated them.
Burton said that people have asked her why is she trying to regulate an industry that has been established in Florida for years. She said hemp-derived THC products are “causing harm to Floridians.”
“We have retailers in the state of Florida that are selling products that are intoxicating,” she said. “They are selling products that are putting adults and children in the hospital. And, sadly, they are selling products that are causing the deaths of Floridians.”
She alluded to a Jacksonville television station’s website, which reported this week on a Georgia woman who  believes her 25-year-old son’s death from heart disease was caused by ingesting Delta-8 gummies. “That young man did not know that what he was ingesting was going to hurt him,” Burton said. 
The bill (SB 438) bans all Delta-8 products and limits the amount of Delta-9 hemp-derived products to no more than five milligrams per serving or 50 milligrams per container. It limits the amount of THC in hemp-infused drinks to five milligrams per container. Such drinks could only be sold through a retailer holding a liquor license.
It requires that each final batch of hemp extract must be tested in a certified marijuana testing laboratory before it may be sold in the state, with results verified and signed by two laboratory employees. The lab would determine whether the product meets the definition of hemp and hemp extract. 
During a combined Florida House workgroup formed to study the hemp industry earlier in the session, the owner of a Lakeland testing lab that contracted with the Florida Department of Agriculture to test cannabis and hemp products appeared. He testified that his lab tested 50 out of 53 flower hemp samples from different smoke/hemp shops across the state that were over the legal 0.3% Delta 9 THC limit, and found contaminants in these products.
“These are very intoxicating products,” said Southeast Florida Republican Sen. Gayle Harrell. “They’re addicting products at the end of the day. And people need to know that. … We need to make sure that people know what they’re buying. And we have seen so many fly-by-night places selling hemp — ‘safe hemp’ — and the THC levels are higher than the medical marijuana that you can get in a dispensary.”
The bill prohibits businesses and food establishments permitted to sell hemp products from advertising “in a manner” visible to  the public from any street, sidewalk, park, or other public place.
Children
Florida law already bans marketing THC-hemp in a way that might attract children. The bill expands that definition to include containers displaying toys or other features that target children and products manufactured in a form or packaged in a container that bears any “reasonable remembrance to a branded food product in a way that the product could mistaken for the branded food product, especially by children.”
And it says that all such products must be placed out of the reach of customers, either in a controlled area accessible only to employees or in a locked display case, excluding hemp-infused beverages.
A similar bill passed unanimously in the Florida Senate a year ago, but Gov. Ron DeSantis vetoed it following heavy lobbying from the hemp industry. Grateful for the reprieve, several hemp entrepreneurs helped fund DeSantis’ campaign to bring down Amendment 3, the proposed constitutional amendment that would have legalized the recreational use of cannabis for adults 21 and over.
Jacksonville Democrat Tracie Davis, who co-sponsored the bill, acknowledged in her closing statement that the bill wasn’t significantly different than last year’s version. “This was a bill that was vetoed,” she said. “There’s not that much that’s different from last year’s bill that was vetoed.”  
The vote in favor was unanimous.
The House version (HB 7027) is now sponsored by Panhandle Republican Rep. Michelle Salzman. It has two more committees to go through before reaching the floor of that chamber.

(Courtesy U.S. Centers for Disease Control)The Indiana Department of Health on Wednesday confirmed five additional cases of the highly infectious measles virus — less than 48 hours after announcing the state’s first laboratory-confirmed case this year in an unvaccinated Allen County minor.
Because measles is so easily spread, a single case is considered an outbreak.
The newly reported cases include three more minors — also unvaccinated. The vaccination status of two infected adults is “unclear,” according to a news release.
“All six cases are connected to each other but at this time there are no known links to outbreaks in other states,” the department continued.
“State and local public health officials are working together on the investigation to contact those with known exposure to help prevent further spread of infection,” the news release added. It said the risk to the general public “remains low.”

Thomas Duszynski, an epidemiology expert at Indiana University Indianapolis’ School of Public Health, said the risk is “low, but it’s not zero.”
“Measles is one of the most infectious organisms on the planet,” he told the Capital Chronicle. A single person with measles passes the virus on to an average of 12-18 people.
If those involved in the outbreak are quarantining, the risk to fellow Hoosiers is lower, Duszynski said. But measles symptoms can also take up to 21 days to present, meaning that infected people can spread the virus before realizing they’re sick.
Symptoms typically include a fever, cough, white bumps inside the mouth and a rash that begins at the hairline and extends down the torso and limbs. The department encouraged Hoosiers experiencing symptoms to stay home and call their doctors “right away,” before going to the doctor’s office. Those with the virus should stay home and away from others.
The risk of severe disease is higher in those with immature or compromised immune systems: young children, pregnant women, the elderly and the sick.
“The current outbreak that’s going on in the U.S., 70-plus of the 600-plus cases have been hospitalized, and most of those are children under the age of five,” he said.
Duszynski warned that measles can also lead to life-threatening complications like pneumonia and brain swelling. Texas health officials have confirmed two measles deaths in unvaccinated school-aged children.
Because it’s a virus, he said, “There is no treatment for measles. There’s only supportive care.”
However, the measles vaccine is among the most effective around. IDOH said one dose of the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine provides 93% protection, and the full two-dose course provides 97% protection.
  A map from the Centers for Disease Control and Protection documenting active measles cases as of April 3, 2025.
Children are routinely vaccinated for measles at 12-15 months old, and again at 4-6 years of age before they go to kindergarten. But children as young as 6 months old can receive the measles vaccine if they are at greater risk.
IDOH encouraged residents to check with their health providers and ensure they and their families are up to date with their vaccines.
Duszynski said people born before 1957 are considered immune “because measles was so common prior to that, that almost everybody got measles. And if you were lucky enough to survive, you have lifelong immunity.”
But those born 1957-1968 may want to consider a booster. A small percentage of the vaccines given over that time period were of the killed virus — less effective than the live virus vaccine typically used. Those with just one dose may also consider a second.
Duszynski noted that 95% of the population must be vaccinated to secure “herd immunity,” protecting people who cannot get the vaccine, like babies, pregnant women and people allergic to its ingredients.
He recommended that people hesitant to get the immunization talk to their doctors.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Amid a nationwide wave of student visa cancellations, 18 University of Utah international students and recent graduates had their visas revoked and their records from a federal Student and Exchange Visitor Information System terminated, many without notice. 
It’s a staggering number, if compared to other high-profile campuses, like Columbia University, which has been aggressively targeted by the Trump Administration for their big pro-Palestine protests, and has reported the termination of four student visas. 
The Utah revocations may have also come as a surprise to the U. students, since none of them were flagged for participating in protests, a University of Utah spokesperson said. The stated reasons, according to the University, “include ‘failure to maintain nonimmigrant status’ and/or criminal record check.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Other public university students across the state have also been affected by the recent cancellations, The Salt Lake Tribune first reported. The Department of Homeland Security terminated the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) records of five Weber State University students. SEVIS is a DHS program that contains and oversees the essential information of students with different types of student visas, in addition to other work programs for recent graduates. 
It’s still unclear whether the termination of those records means the visas are revoked, a Weber State University spokesperson said. 
The Utah System of Higher Education declined to comment on the students’ issues with their academic permits.
At Utah Tech, nine students had their I-20s canceled, a public information officer said. That’s a document issued by schools that certifies a student’s eligibility to study in the country. 
At Salt Lake Community College, three students had their visas revoked; at Snow College, two students were impacted; and three Utah Valley University students were also affected, spokespeople for the institutions said on Wednesday. While Utah State University students have been affected, the school declined to provide exact numbers to protect the students’ privacy.
What we know about the U. students
Most higher education institutions haven’t released much information on the circumstances surrounding the terminations, since cases are still recent and uncertain. 
However, Utah’s flagship university had some more details as of Wednesday morning. Approximately half of the students are from China, a spokesperson said in an email. The other half are from several countries including India and some Middle Eastern countries. 



Let us know what you think...


 


Similar actions from the Department of Homeland Security and Department of State are routine, the spokesperson said. 
“Over the course of any school year, international students may have their visas revoked or SEVIS records terminated as the result of an arrest or being charged with criminal activity,” the spokesperson said. Those activities may include domestic violence allegations or driving under the influence.
Utah News Dispatch hasn’t been able to obtain additional details about the affected students. However, according to the Tribune, most of them don’t have criminal records while some have had received traffic infractions.
But, what’s new is that SEVIS records are being terminated without any notification to the university or students. Many institutions have noticed the cancellations in routine checks of the system to verify students’ status. 
“As a public institution of higher education, the University of Utah follows state and federal law. We are currently in a period of enhanced immigration enforcement,” the spokesperson said. “We are sharing guidance with our international students and scholars about the ways they can stay in good standing and maintain their visa status.”
In an email sent to international students, the U. advised to take proactive steps to preserve their visa status. 
“While there have been no changes to immigration laws at this time, it is important to note that modifications can occur with little notice,” the university’s International Students and Scholar Services office wrote. 
Other instructions also include avoiding nonessential international travel, maintaining full-time enrollment or, for recent graduates, employment; following all laws “including those related to alcohol, drug use, driving, and participation in public gatherings,” and keeping all immigration documents valid and readily accessible.
“It is recommended that you carry copies of your I-94 record, visa documentation, or passport stamps that demonstrate your lawful status,” the email reads.

“The display would still be in a common area there inside the public schools, and the display would be among other historical documents,” Kelley told members of the Senate Education Policy Committee.

Under the legislation, public K-12 schools will be required to display an 11-inch-by-14-inch poster of the Ten Commandments. Alabama voters in 2018 approved a constitutional amendment allowing the Ten Commandments to be displayed on public property but not mandating such displays.
Local school boards do not have to use their state-allocated funds to purchase a poster to display, Gidley said. The legislation does not list any sanctions for schools that do not comply.
“The substitute does not require the LEAs to post the display unless the State Superintendent certifies that donations are available,” Gidley told members of the House Education Policy Committee. 
The Senate version of the bill heard from critics and supporters in March. Most of the critics said the translation of the Ten Commandments in the bill is not an accurate historical account of the Hebrew-derived text. Supporters said the text is the foundation of Western civilization. 
Both bills were approved unanimously by their respective committees and will now be considered by each chamber.

Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon, speaks March 25 on the Missouri House floor. (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications)After a heavy lobbying effort, backers of video lottery games squeezed a slim majority out of the Missouri House on Wednesday, sending a bill promising $350 million a year for schools to the state Senate.
By an 83-73 vote — just one more than the minimum needed to pass — the House approved the bill that also promises to remove “gray market machines” from retail locations.
“This is not a solution in search of a problem,” said the sponsor, Republican Rep. Bill Hardwick of Dixon. “We have a genuine problem, a money problem, a regulatory problem, a commerce problem, and this is a solution for all of that.”
House leadership held the tally board open for more than 15 minutes as they searched for the votes needed to pass. The bill was given first-round approval on Monday but with only 74 votes.
After that backers and opponents scrambled to find votes, with both sides claiming Tuesday that they would prevail.
The bill faces an uncertain future in the state Senate. Three video lottery bills have been proposed in the upper chamber but none have been given a hearing.
In the final vote, 54 Republicans were joined by 29 Democrats to pass the bill, while 18 Democrats and 55 Republicans opposed it. 
Passing video lottery bill would be ‘a heavy lift’ in Missouri Senate

The bill received support from nine of 10 Republicans who were absent on Monday and present on Wednesday. Five GOP members on each side of the question switched from yes to no or vice-versa.
Among Democrats, four members absent on Monday voted yes on Wednesday, while two Monday absentees voted no. Only one Democrat switched sides, voting no on Wednesday after voting yes on Monday. 
Under the bill, the Missouri Lottery would be given the job of licensing video lottery terminal vendors and regulating their use in retail locations. While there would be a cap of eight machines in any location, the total number of machines that would be in use statewide is not capped.
The House added an amendment so counties and cities will be able to authorize — or ban — video lottery games in their home communities. It also added an amendment that declares any unlicensed games that offer cash prizes to winners to be illegal slot machines.
The games resembling casino slot machines that can be seen at retail locations throughout the state are unregulated. Called gray market or “no chance” games, operators claim they are not illegal under current law because a player can learn the outcome of the next play before committing their money.
The options for a player with a pending losing bet are to change games in search of a winner, ending their playing session or deliberately losing the bet to get to the next outcome.
The Missouri State Highway Patrol has tried to initiate prosecutions under anti-gambling laws, but most prosecutors have been reluctant to file charges.
And after years of operation, convenience store owners, fraternal lodges and other establishments have become dependent on the revenue.
The video lottery machines will be more trustworthy, supporters say, because the machines will be required to pay out at least 80% of the money wagered in prizes. 
The remainder will be split three ways — the lottery will receive 34% of the net to support state education programs, with retailers and operators splitting the other 66%. The fiscal note for the bill estimates that within three years, there will be $1.1 billion annually for the three-way split generating approximately $350 million in state revenue.
Some opponents of the measure argue it is not strong enough to force gray market machine operators to shut down. Others said they do not support any expansion of gambling.
“I fully support my American Legion and VFW,” said state Rep. Dean Van Schoiack, a Republican from Savannah, “but they better be able to find a better way to raise funds than stealing from their members and their patrons.”

Sam Zurier offers one way to plug the $32.6 million hole in the Rhode Island Public Transit Authority’s upcoming budget: increasing the bus agency’s share of the gas tax.
The Providence Democrat’s bill — one of four proposals seeking to solve the cash-strapped bus network’s funding woes — would increase RIPTA’s share of the state’s tax on gasoline from 26% to 30%. It’s a funding strategy that’s garnered support from transit advocates and the agency’s leader.
“With a $32 million shortfall, that’s helpful,” RIPTA CEO Christopher Durand told the Senate Committee on Finance at a hearing on Tuesday.
But the chairman of RIPTA’s board of directors is opposed to the idea, arguing Zurier’s gas tax shift would take away from the state department he leads.
“It would result in an annual loss of approximately $7 million, significantly impacting our capital program,” Rhode Island Department of Transportation Director Peter Alviti Jr., who the state mandated to steer RIPTA’s board in 2023, wrote to the committee. 
Alviti did not attend Tuesday’s three-hour hearing.
Zurier argued Alviti’s stance goes against RIPTA’s board-supported goal of finding a sustainable funding source — which the gas tax has become less stable as more drivers shift to more fuel-efficient and electric vehicles.
RIPTA now gets about $40 million in annual gasoline tax revenues, based on its existing allocation of 9.75 cents per gallon. That revenue is projected to drop over $1 million when fiscal year 2026 starts July 1, according to projections from the Rhode Island Department of Revenue.
“This would only restore the share RIPTA had,” Zurier said. “It’s very common sense.”
Three other proposals were heard by the committee:

A bill by Sen. Meghan Kallman, a Providence Democrat, would add a 75-cent fee to each fare collected by rideshare companies in order to fund mass transit.
A bill by Sen. Robert Britto, an East Providence Democrat, would earmark the state’s existing tax on rideshare trips toward mass transit.
A resolution by Sen. Mark McKenney, a Warwick Democrat, would allocate $32.6 million from the general fund to fill RIPTA’s latest budget gap.

All four bills were held for further study by the committee as is standard procedure for an initial vetting by a legislative panel.
Higher fares, layoffs, pushing ad sales
Realistically, Durand said RIPTA can only cut around $10 million from its deficit because most of the expenses in the agency’s $154 million spending plan are funded with federal money or tied into existing operations.
“There really isn’t a whole lot to trim,” Durand said.
The agency projects about 300 employees losing their jobs if lawmakers don’t provide any new funding.
There are ways RIPTA can try to generate revenue. A presentation Durand gave the committee floated a 5% fare increase, which the agency projects would bring in $470,871 annually. But such a change could decrease ridership by 100,000 trips, according to RIPTA’s presentation. 
Durand had promised the agency’s board of directors last December that raising fares would not be on the table.
Another potential source could be by courting more businesses to buy ad spots on sheltered stops, which the agency projects would bring in $440,000 annually.
Committee Chairman Lou DiPalma, a Middletown Democrat, suggested RIPTA could take over non-emergency medical transportation for Medicaid enrollees, something the agency used to provide until the service was privatized some years ago.

About that efficiency study
State leaders are still waiting on RIPTA to submit an independent efficiency study of its operations, as mandated in the state’s fiscal 2025 budget. 
The study was supposed to be done March 1, but the agency’s board of directors delayed the bid process last year until it could find a permanent CEO Durand, who was the interim CEO for seven months, took over the agency permanently last November.
RIPTA’s board finally awarded a contract to do the efficiency study on March 27 to Canadian engineering consulting firm WSP, which likely won’t have a final report complete until the summer — after the General Assembly likely wraps up this year’s legislative session.
Durand provided lawmakers with a two-page memo from WSP detailing how transit agencies nationwide are dealing with ridership and workforce challenges following the pandemic.
DiPalma called the lack of a final study at this point “extremely disappointing.”
“We need facts and data,” he said. “This is not going to satisfy what we need for the budget.”
But DiPalma did not blame Durand for RIPTA’s latest financial crisis, instead placing it on Gov. Dan McKee for leaving it unaddressed in his recommended budget and passing the buck to the General Assembly.
“That’s categorically what happened — we’re given the charge to figure it out, and we’re going to figure it out,” DiPalma said. “Rhode Islanders expect to have a public transit authority that serves their needs — in an efficient and effective manner.”

(Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)The leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.

Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.

The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.

Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

(Screenshot courtesy of the Democratic Party of New Mexico)As U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was visiting a conservative charter school in Gallup on Wednesday morning, the head of New Mexico’s Democratic Party held a news conference to denounce Kennedy as a “conspiracy theorist and an amateur cabinet secretary.”
“It’s disgraceful that he’s visiting a part of the state that lost so many lives to COVID, a disease that he consistently spread misinformation about,” said Jessica Velasquez, chair of the Democratic Party of New Mexico. “RFK’s platform isn’t just fringe, it’s deadly, especially for people in our rural and tribal areas. He’s proved time and again that he shouldn’t be trusted with our lives, our health or our communities.”
The office of Navajo Nation President Buu Nygren published a schedule showing that it was hosting Kennedy for two hours on Wednesday morning. According to the schedule, Nygren and Kennedy were expected to hike on the Window Rock trail, attend a welcoming address by the head of the nation’s health department, take part in a blessing ceremony and watch a performance by the Dineh Tah’ Navajo Dancers.
The schedule shows Kennedy then headed to Hózhó Academy in the Navajo Nation border town of Gallup, which Source NM on Tuesday revealed to be one likely stop during his visit.
As Kennedy was scheduled to visit the school, Velasquez told reporters in a virtual news conference it’s “ironic” that Kennedy is visiting the Navajo Nation, “which was ravaged by the COVID-19 pandemic, almost more than any other community in our country.”
The Navajo Nation in May 2020 reported one of the highest per-capita COVID-19 infection rates in the United States. Velasquez said Donald Trump’s first presidential administration botched the response to the COVID-19 pandemic, “and we can’t afford another.”
At least one Indian Health Service building in Gallup is on a list of lease terminations proposed by the so-called “Department of Government Efficiency,” which Velasquez also mentioned on Wednesday.
“Our tribes know the cost of public health failure,” she said. “They experienced one of the highest COVID-19 death rates per capita in the United States. If RFK had been in charge during COVID, I think it’s safe to say that more people would have died, especially in rural and Indigenous communities where access to health care is already limited.”
‘What’s next, polio?’
Velasquez also pointed to the measles outbreak in southeastern New Mexico and west Texas, with nearly 60 cases in New Mexico.
New Mexico’s health department on Tuesday said an unvaccinated child in Chaves County has measles, adding a third county to the ongoing outbreak in the state’s southeastern section.
Velasquez said she has strong feelings about Kennedy’s visit because she has school-aged children, and she “can’t imagine what those families in southern New Mexico are going through, dealing with a disease that should be extinct in this country.”
“The consistent misinformation from Kennedy has contributed to this measles outbreak, a disease that was all but eradicated in the United States,” Velasquez said. “With RFK at the helm at Health and Human Services, what’s next, polio?”
In response to questions on Tuesday from Source about the measles outbreak and Kennedy’s visit, Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham noted the HHS Secretary’s remarks over the weekend endorsing the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine after he visited with families in Gaines County, Texas who lost children to the disease.
“I hope that, given that he’s been exposed to measles, I assume he’s now immune, given his age and that I think he got a measles vaccine younger. I don’t know what his entourage looks like and I hope that they are vaccinated and, if they’re not, I hope they’re not coming into New Mexico exposing anyone else, because it would be the worst public-facing engagement of a health secretary in anyone’s lifetime,” she said, adding: “I appreciate that he’s all about the vaccine, but spread is spread.”
Velasquez said John Enders, the scientist who helped culture the virus that causes polio in human muscle and tissue in a laboratory setting, “must be rolling in his grave,” along with Jonas Salk, another scientist who developed the techniques that lead to the polio vaccine, and Louis Pasteur, whose studies helped popularize the germ theory of disease.

(Photo: Screenshot from NCGA video feed)North Carolina lawmakers have proposed at least nine bills this year that seek more regulation on the sale and purchase of gummies, drinks, and vaping products containing compounds from hemp. 
Most of the bills seek to make it illegal for youth to buy snacks, drinks, and vape products containing hemp-derived cannabinoids or to keep them off school property. Legislators and sheriffs talked about one of the bills, House Bill 680, The Protect Children from Cannabis Act, at a Wednesday news conference. 
The bill would make it illegal for shops to sell consumables containing hemp compounds without a permit, and would make it illegal for people under 21 to buy them. The Alcohol Beverage Control Commission and the ALE would have investigative and enforcement powers. 
“Currently, there’s no age restriction on purchasing these intoxicating cannabinoids, and children do use these and buy these every day,” said Rep. Timothy Reeder (R-Pitt), one of the bill’s primary sponsors.
Onslow County Sheriff Chris Thomas said vape shops have opened near schools in his county to take advantage of the young customer base.
It appears sellers are focusing on young customers, he said, “because the young clientele is a customer for a long time.”
An effort to regulate snacks containing hemp cannabinoids and banning the products from schools faltered last year when the state Senate attached medical marijuana legalization to a House bill. The House and Senate have been at an impasse over medical marijuana for several years. 
Reeder said he anticipates parties interested in regulating edibles will work together to pass a bill this session. “I hope we can do something versus nothing,” he said. 
The Child Fatality Task Force noted in its annual report that the rate of emergency department visits in North Carolina related to cannabis increased 600% for children and teens younger than 17 and by more than 1000% among older teens since 2019. A 2018 federal law legalized hemp.

The Legal Defense Fund, or LDF, announced it sent the university’s administration a letter Tuesday, alongside the National Women’s Law Center, Asian Americans Advancing Justice and Latino Justice, in an effort to push back against federal pressures to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policies.
The push comes in response to emails LDF says in a news release students at the University of Michigan’s law school received recently from a conservative group asserting the university unfairly expresses preferences for certain students under DEI policies, amid Trump’s executive order to withhold federal funding for organizations and programs with DEI policies.
Late last month U of M announced it would be closing its Office of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion with university officials saying that the school would pivot their efforts to “core responsibilities”.
According to LDF, students are already seeing the consequences of divestment into diversity with a mass email that was sent out to students at the law school from conservative group Faculty, Alumni, and Students Opposed to Racial Preferences or FASORP.

The group is represented by prominent conservative attorneys Jonathan Mitchell, regarded as the legal mind behind anti-abortion heartbeat laws and Stephen Miller, President Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff.
According to LDF, the letter that was sent to students in the law school on March 31 alleged that the Michigan Law Review, the university’s law journal, shows discriminatory preference towards women, students of color and LGBTQ+ students, with the implication that students of those demographics are not deserving of being published by the journal.
“We strongly condemn these threats as an unjust attack on students’ abilities and an attempt to perpetuate harmful stereotypes and discrimination,” LDF said in a news release. “No student should be told that their identity makes them undeserving of their accomplishments. We hope the University of Michigan Law School will further affirm its commitment to diversity, equal opportunity, and excellence, ensuring that the hard work and talents of students from all backgrounds are valued and respected.”

Both universities declined to provide additional information to protect the privacy of affected students.
The number of Colorado students who lost their visas doubled from the counts the universities provided a week ago: four students from CU and six students from CSU.

(Photo by Kenny Holston-Pool/Getty Images)Republicans in the Minnesota Senate and House on Wednesday were unconvinced by Democrats’ proposal to implement a first-in-the-nation tax on social media companies that collect data on Minnesotans, arguing the costs of the comparatively small tax on the nation’s largest corporations that earn billions annually would eventually trickle down to middle-class Minnesotans.
The bill, chief authored by Senate Taxes Committee Chair Sen. Ann Rest, DFL-New Hope, would impose an excise tax on social media companies based on the number of monthly active Minnesota consumers from whom the company collects data.
Minnesota is facing a looming multi-billion dollar budget deficit, and lawmakers are working to cut spending and generate new revenue to offset the imbalance — the new tax on social media is among the ideas.
Under the bill (SF 3197), the largest social media companies — those that have over 1 million Minnesota consumers — would be taxed $165,000 per month, plus 50 cents times the number of consumers over 1 million.
The Department of Revenue estimates the tax would apply to 14 social media companies. The tax would begin in January 2026 and would generate around $46 million in the first fiscal year, $92 million in the second and about $100 million annually after that.
Meta, the parent company of Facebook, reported $62 billion in profit in 2024, on $164 billion in revenue.
Republicans on the Senate Taxes Committee said the new tax would hurt Minnesota businesses. Local businesses advertise on social media, and platforms like Facebook and Instagram would pass on the cost of the tax onto Minnesota businesses, said Sen. Bill Weber, R-Luverne.
“Quite frankly, if you don’t believe that the cost of their advertising is going to go up as a result of a new tax, I think you’re kidding yourself. It is going to be a cost to Minnesotans at the end of the day,” Weber said.
Rest on Wednesday acknowledged that the bill will likely lead to litigation, as companies could interpret the legislation to be in violation of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which prohibits state and local governments from imposing taxes directly on internet access or online activity.
University of California Davis School of Law Professor Darien Shanske, who studies digital taxation, testified that Minnesota would have a strong case.
“It would be inappropriate for legislatures to give up on sound tax policy in the face of novel legal arguments that will ultimately be defeated,” Shanske told the Senate Taxes Committee Wednesday. Courts have generally ruled in states’ favor in disputes over revenue generators, he said.
Even as social media companies make hundreds of billions of profit, social scientists are sounding the alarm on the widespread use of the apps, especially by young people.
Democrats on the Senate Taxes Committee framed the tax as one worth fighting for, resembling sin taxes on tobacco and alcohol.
Sen. Grant Hauschild, DFL-Hermantown, compared the social media tax to state taxes on mining. When you mine the earth, Hauschild said, companies pay taxes so people in the area can benefit from social services funded by mining taxes. The same should be done for social media, he argued.
“These are leeches on our society. Leeches that we have come to accept, but they are leeches nonetheless,” Hauschild said of the billionaires who run social media companies. “There’s no reason that we shouldn’t, as Minnesotans, decide to fight the fight, take the legal recourse and try to tax these people who are benefiting most from us.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Lawmakers in a House Ways and Means Committee Wednesday advanced a bill, and uttered a number of bee-related puns, to exempt the sale of honeybees from state sales tax.
The bill would bring honeybees in line with the tax protocol of other livestock, which are exempt from state sales tax.
Richard Vonderohe, a beekeeper in Mason City and president of the North Iowa Beekeepers Club, said the bill would help beekeepers, — especially those who have suffered from bee losses over the winter.

Commercial beekeepers lost on average 62% of their colonies from June 2024 to January 2025, according to results from a survey of beekeepers, administered by Project Apis m. and other bee industry groups.
Project Apis called it the largest honeybee loss recorded in the country, and estimated the economic impact, caused by lost revenue and the cost of replacing colonies, to be $600 million on beekeepers. The broader economic impact could be even greater, as honeybees are responsible for pollinating $15 billion worth of U.S. crops, annually, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Researchers are uncertain what is causing the losses, though many, including Vonderohe, wonder if commercial pesticide use is to blame. Honeybee colonies can also be harmed by parasites, disease and starvation. 
“I’ve had enough losses,” Vonderohe said. “We need help with our bees.”
Rep. Mike Vondran, R-Dubuque, called House File 247 the “sweetest bill” of the day. He said exempting honeybees from the state tax has a fiscal note of less than $20,000 annually.
“But it’ll really do a lot with regard to helping spur on a growing industry in the state of Iowa,” Vondran said. 
Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, supported the bill that she said has had “lots of buzz.” 
According to USDA report from March, Iowa has around 41,000 honeybee colonies, though this number is likely higher as USDA only reports on producers with five colonies or more. 
HF 247, called a “bee-utiful bill” by Vondran in his closing remarks, passed unanimously from the committee and is now eligible for floor debate.
More than just honeybees 
There are more than 4,000 native bee species in the country and according to the U.S. Geological Survey, bees are the primary pollinators for the majority of agricultural crops.
While they won’t get any honey out of the deal, Iowans have an opportunity this summer to engage with native bee populations as part of a national survey project.

The Iowa Department of Natural Resources is seeking participants in its second Bumble Bee Atlas and will host online trainings April 19 and May 10.
The citizen science project aims to identify the bumblebee species of Iowa, where they’re located and their preferences in flowers. 
Last year, participants conducted nearly 150 surveys and identified 10 bumblebee species. The brown-belted bumblebee was the most common species identified last year and DNR estimates there are more species to be found in Iowa.  
Participants need a net, cellphone or other camera, bee-holding container, a cooler and about 45-minutes to dedicate to catching and identifying bees. Those interested can register online.
Twenty states participate in the Bumble Bee Atlas and collectively have observed 36 species of bumble bees and engaged more than 4,000 citizen scientists.

“Mark my words, Florida citrus is not going down on my watch. We’re on the edge of something special. Florida citrus is making a comeback, one tree at a time,” Senate President Ben Albritton said in a news release.
“This heritage industry is not only vital to our state’s economy, but it is truly a part of our DNA. Citrus has been a pillar of our state since the 1500s, serving as a key economic driver within our vital agricultural industry.”
The remaining $10 million would go to the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services for an 80% cost-share with citrus packinghouses for equipment maintenance or purchase.
FAMU research
While the Senate focuses on funding research to revive the citrus industry (Albritton is a fourth generation citrus farmer), it is looking to support farmers who could grow other crops in the meantime.
The Senate cast unanimous yeas to research crops better suited to sustain Florida’s agriculture industry as citrus greening ravages the state’s crop of pride. 
Sen. Darryl Rouson, a Democrat representing parts of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties, led SB 178, which would commission a Florida A&M University study to determine whether there are “viable crops or products” that agricultural producers could raise instead of citrus. 
Citrus industry, ‘decimated’ by greening, clings to hope, Simpson says

“FAMU is uniquely positioned to lead this study as a university with a strong history of agricultural research,” Rouson said on the Senate floor Wednesday. “Their expertise will ensure that the study will provide practical and science-based recommendations to support our growers and maintain Florida’s leadership in agriculture.”
The Senate budget proposes $1 million in general revenue for the study. 
FAMU, if appropriated the money, would research alternative crops’ environmental impact, suitability to Florida’s climate, and expected economic benefit.

‘Decimated’
Over the past 20 years, the citrus industry in Florida has declined by 90%. 
According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Florida farmers produced nearly 300 million boxes of citrus in 2004. By 2024, harvests yielded about 20 million boxes. The forecast for 2025 is 14.1 million boxes, according to the USDA.
Citrus greening, the insect-carried tree disease that first hit Florida in 2005, has “decimated” the industry, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson told the Senate Agriculture Committee on Jan. 14. Psyllids, or plant lice, infect citrus trees, damaging yields and ultimately killing the tree.
In 2019, citrus farmers reported that about 80% of their trees were infected. 
Researchers at the University of Florida announced earlier this year that they’ve found “one of the most promising discoveries to date” related to greening, although growers are still about five years away from determining how effective UF’s findings are. 
The bill heads to the House, which does not have a companion bill.

(Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)The Trump administration has so far cancelled $296,455,163 in federal funds promised to Minnesota, with an additional $55,989,150 in funding temporarily disrupted.
Those figures come from a new Walz administration tracker of federal funding pauses and recissions, which officials say will now be updated daily.
“By tracking these changes, we’re doing what we can to keep Minnesotans informed on what we know and what’s to come,” Gov. Tim Walz said in a statement. “Decisions made by billionaires in Washington are cutting real programs that save Minnesotans money, monitor disease outbreaks, and keep us safe.”
The bulk of the funding cancellations, totaling roughly $230 million, affect the Minnesota Department of Health, which has been forced to lay off 170 employees in grant-funded positions. Another 20 employees who were slated to start new positions with MDH have had those offers rescinded.
The largest contributor to the MDH cuts is the cancellation of $179 million from the CDC, for “flexible funding” to respond to future infectious disease outbreaks. 
The Minnesota Department of Education is losing $18 million in higher education funding, while the Department of Human Services is reporting a loss of around $27 million to help people with substance abuse and mental health problems.
Additionally, the Department of Agriculture is losing $18 million in funding for programs that purchase local food for schools and food shelves.
Nearly all of the federal funds the state lists as “temporarily disrupted” would affect the Department of Public Safety. Those funds consist of FEMA grants to help the department prevent and respond to natural disasters and terror threats.
“One in every three dollars Minnesota state government spends currently comes from the federal government,” said Minnesota Management and Budget Commissioner Erin Campbell. “Consistent, timely access to federal dollars is needed to continue providing the services Minnesotans depend on.”
The figures included in the state tracker do not include funding cuts to colleges, non-profits, and other non-governmental organizations. Those cuts, depending on how they’re implemented, could add tens of millions or more to the totals, including for medical research conducted by institutions like the Mayo Clinic.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/NN250405_1035-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 16:10:50.699121

Chris Van Hollen and Democratic Rep. Glenn Ivey, whose district includes the family’s home in Beltsville, criticized the Trump administration for not only accidentally deporting Abrego Garcia, but labeling him as a MS-13 gang member, despite his lack of a criminal record in any country, including the U.S.“He was whisked off without any due process, and is now in a torturous … jail in El Salvador,” Van Hollen said.Senators send letterIn 2019 Abrego Garcia was given removal orders to his home country.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A bill that would repeal the work permit requirements for West Virginia 14- and 15-year-olds seeking employment is nearing a vote in the House of Delegates.
The House Government Organization Committee on Wednesday signed off on Senate Bill 427 on Wednesday. 
The minimum legal age to work in West Virginia is 14. Currently, state law requires 14- and 15-year-olds who want to work to get a permit from their school superintendent. The permit includes age certification, a commitment by the employer to employ the child legally, a description of the work the child is applying to do, a signature by the child’s principal saying that they’re attending school, and parental consent. 
If SB 427 becomes law, employers seeking to hire the teenagers would be required to obtain an age certificate verifying the child’s age from the state Division of Labor and the written consent of the child’s parent or guardian. 
The age certificate would include the child’s age, name and date of birth as well as information about the job they’re seeking, among other things. 
The committee adopted an amendment from Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, that the job description listed on an age certificate be supplied by the employer as opposed to the child. 
Brooke Farber, deputy commissioner and counsel for the state Division of Labor, testified that the agency prefers that the job description come from the employer to ensure that the job doesn’t violate restrictions on children working in hazardous working conditions. State and federal law prohibits minors from working in certain hazardous occupations, including roofing, mining, operating fork lifts and others. 
“We just want to make sure, and a 14 or 15 year old might not necessarily be familiar with a hazardous occupation, so that would be it,” she said. 
The bill will next go to the floor of the House of Delegates to be read three times before delegates vote on the bill.",https://westvirginiawatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kayla-Young-20250409.jpg,,,2025-04-09 16:10:50.699121

His executive order, issued Tuesday, directs the Department of Justice to challenge a huge swath of state laws and regulations. The order aims at measures that seek to cut carbon emissions, penalize energy companies and limit drilling permits. It also targets state-led lawsuits against fossil fuel companies over the damages caused by climate change.
Trump’s directive orders Attorney General Pam Bondi to “stop the enforcement” of any state laws related to climate change, including any that are seen as “burdening” the use of domestic energy resources. Such language could include state laws that mandate a transition to clean electricity sources.
The order specifically calls out “climate Superfund” policies in Vermont and New York, which require fossil fuel companies to pay for some of the damages caused by climate change. It also targets California’s cap-and-trade law, which places a limit on emissions through auctions of carbon credits.
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

While Trump’s order says such state policies are unconstitutional, climate-focused state leaders say his administration has no legal basis to unravel their efforts.
“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement from the U.S. Climate Alliance. “We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred.”
Hochul and Lujan Grisham co-chair the alliance, a coalition of 24 governors focused on reducing emissions.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Politico that the order is “toothless.”
“[Trump] has no authority on his own to nullify state laws,” he told the outlet.
But the order throws the might of the federal government into a sprawling legal battle over states’ authority to set climate policy and seek damages for disasters.
It could force states to face expensive litigation and years of legal uncertainty. Trump-appointed judges on the U.S. Supreme Court and elsewhere have at times been hostile to environmental regulations. And it’s unclear whether the order will have a chilling effect on state efforts to craft more climate legislation.

Amy Regier, R-Kalispell, seeks to block obscene content from reaching children. (Getty Images)Following passage of laws last session requiring adult websites to require age verification, a bill in the Montana Legislature seeks to go a step further and add a filter on electronic devices.
House Bill 408, brought by Rep. Amy Regier, R-Kalispell, seeks to block obscene content from reaching children and establishes liability for someone who removes the filter as well the device manufacturer.
The bill was tabled in the Senate Judiciary Committee, though it could come back.
“Nothing is truly considered dead until sine die,” Regier said.
Protection from content deemed harmful to children, especially surrounding technology, has been key to a number of bills this session. 
“Parents have the ultimate responsibility to train their children in moral and character development. Modern technology has potential for great good but also harm. Montana can help parents and protect our children,” Regier said in an emailed comment to the Daily Montanan. “Requiring a device filter to be activated for all minors helps to safeguard against obscene content. Obscene content that can lead to risky behaviors, addictions and vulnerability to sexual predators.”
The bill passed the House 82-19 on third reading to move it over to the Senate, with the dissent including a mix of Republicans and Democrats.
In its Senate hearing, proponents included the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, the Montana Family Foundation and Alex Sterhan with the Montana Department of Justice.
Former Republican Montana State Rep. Scott Reichner, speaking for the National Center on Sexual Exploitation, said the legislation would help with the “mass spread of human trafficking in the state.”
Opponents to the bill included the Taxpayers Protection Alliance, the Montana Chamber of Commerce, the Parkview Institute — an organization that supports economic freedom — as well as the Computer & Communications Industry Association.
Their argument was HB 408 was a barrier to businesses and an increase in potential liability.
“HB 408 presents serious technical and legal issues. Internet service providers, not device manufacturers, are the ones equipped to manage content access,” Aodhan Downey, state policy manager for CCIA, said in a statement. “Requiring a state-specific default filter not only creates unworkable compliance challenges but also leaves many devices — especially those without location-tracking or that are sold online — beyond the bill’s regulatory reach.
“What’s more, the bill imposes steep penalties based on vague determinations of obscenity, leaving businesses to either over-filter lawful content or face costly litigation.”
Some opponents stated it would stifle competition or could wrongly censor classical artwork that contains nudity. A similar bill has floated around the Utah Legislature.
Legislators in Senate Judiciary supported the spirit of the bill, but did have some concerns. 
“I think it’s a great effort, but I don’t think it’s the solution,” Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, said on April 8 when the committee took executive action on the bill.
Sen. Theresa Manzella, R-Hamilton, said she was originally going to support the bill, saying she did recognize the state had a “very serious problem” with minors accessing obscene content. But “untended consequences” on device manufacturers helped sway her decision.
“I think we have done some very good work in this body in past sessions and the reports are that it’s working,” Manzella said during executive action. “Another issue is that I support parental rights, and I support parental responsibility to parent their children and work through these issues with their children.”

(File photo by Getty Images)COLUMBIA — South Carolina drivers caught holding or scrolling on their cellphones while driving would face upwards of $100 in fines under legislation approved by the House. Repeat offenders could see their insurance rates increase.
The “hands-free” bill was approved 85-25 on Wednesday. All but three of the “no” votes came from Republicans.
A perfunctory third reading, expected Thursday, will send the measure to the Senate.
“We’ve all seen people going down the highway. They’re driving blind. They are not looking at the road,” Rep. Bill Taylor told reporters after the vote. “They are six times more dangerous than a drunk driver. It has got to stop.”
The Aiken Republican has long been a proponent. But for more than two decades, the state Legislature has ducked such efforts.
Now, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration is threatening the state with the loss of $50 million or more in annual federal highway funding.
A 2011 federal rule required states to pass laws banning handheld cellphone use for drivers of commercial vehicles, but proposals failed in the House year after year.
In 2022, the Senate passed a version of the legislation, but that one never even reached the House floor.
Without a hands-free driving law, SC could lose upwards of $40M in federal road funding

Late last year, the federal agency sent a warning letter to Gov. Henry McMaster’s office and the state Department of Motor Vehicles: Put a law in place by July 2025, or the federal government will start docking 4% of funding it sends to the state for road construction. The penalty would go up to 8% every year after that until the law is changed.
Under the proposal, drivers caught holding a cellphone — either in their hand or in their lap — reading a text, or watching videos would be fined $100 on first offense. Each additional violation in a three-year span would cost $200 and add two points to a driver’s license.
Those points impact a person’s car insurance rates, acting as a deterrent, Taylor said.
Hands-free phone calls and voice-to-text messaging would still be legal. Stiff penalties for drivers who severely injure or kill someone while distracted by a cellphone were removed from an earlier version of the bill.
The House also added a measure requiring officers to have an “unobstructed view” of a person holding or using their cell phone before they have the probable cause necessary to pull them over.
If ultimately passed, the law would take effect a year after it’s either signed by the governor or becomes law without his signature.
For the first three months of enforcement, police officers would write warning citations only.

(Getty Images)Lawmakers in several states are pushing bills to prohibit unauthorized sales of hard-to-get restaurant reservations.
Proposed bills in California, Florida, Illinois and Louisiana take aim at online platforms such as Appointment Trader that allow diners to sell coveted reservations on the open market — sometimes without a restaurant’s knowledge.
In Louisiana, the issue gained attention surrounding February’s Super Bowl, when one customer paid more than $2,000 for a table at a top New Orleans restaurant, the Louisiana Illuminator reported.
Proponents of the platforms say these services provide customer flexibility and can boost restaurant business. But restaurant groups have opposed their entry into the market, arguing that they undermine the dining experience and can leave restaurants with empty tables.
The Illinois and Louisiana legislation follows New York state’s Restaurant Reservation Anti-Piracy Act, which went into effect in February. The law aims at curbing the “black market” in which reservations are scooped up as soon as they go live, Gothamist reported.
The Louisiana Restaurant Association asked state lawmakers to file a similar measure.
Wendy Waren, spokesperson for the association, told the Louisiana Illuminator that online platforms are selling reservations without restaurant’s permission or knowledge. If no one purchases reservations, tables can sit empty, preventing legitimate customers from getting a reservation, Waren said.
“It creates artificial scarcity,” Waren said. “It’s like somebody’s hijacking the process.”
Someone paid $2,138 for a reservation at a French Quarter restaurant. Should this be outlawed?

The Republican-sponsored bill, which would require platforms to have contracts with restaurants, is pending before the state House Commerce Committee.
A similar bill just won unanimous approval from the Illinois state House and now moves onto the state Senate for consideration.
The legislation would require a written agreement between restaurants and reservation platforms and would create a civil penalty of up to $1,000 for each violation of the new law.
State Rep. Margaret Croke, the Democrat who sponsored the bill, characterized the move as a “commonsense” measure to protect restaurants and consumers alike.
“At a time when local restaurants are operating with extremely tight margins and working to recover from the impacts of COVID-19, they shouldn’t have to deal with third-party services snatching up their reservations and selling them at a premium, which leads to no-shows and confusion that only hurts their bottom lines,” Croke said in a statement.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

The laws do not affect a restaurant’s ability to contract with reservation platforms such as OpenTable and Resy, which have applauded state crackdowns on other third-party sites.
Jonas Frey, who founded Appointment Trader, told the New York Times he launched the platform to help people get tables for a “fair market price.”
Last summer, he acknowledged that computer bots making reservations and then selling them were an issue, and said he had tried to prevent them from exploiting the website. But he said his website had only become popular because it was already difficult to get a reservation, especially in the New York City area.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)  A Senate subcommittee moved forward with the second step in amending the state constitution Wednesday to require a two-thirds majority vote of the Legislature for income tax increases.
Senate Study Bill 1221 is a follow-up from House Joint Resolution 2006, passed in 2024 with the same language. To amend the Iowa Constitution, lawmakers must pass the amendment language in two consecutive general assemblies, before the measure goes before voters on a general election ballot for final approval. If the measure is approved in the 2025 or 2026 legislative session, the amendment will appear on Iowans’ ballots in the Nov. 5, 2026 election.
Several advocates spoke in favor of the legislation at the subcommittee meeting, saying that it will provide more certainty to individuals and businesses that their taxes will not increase. Opponents argued the measure will limit state lawmakers’ ability to respond to financial crises.

Mike Owen with Common Good Iowa, a progressive policy organization, said he was opposed to the measure not only because “it puts the thumb on the scale for bad tax policy,” but because it violates the “basic principle of one person, one vote,” giving significantly more power to lawmakers who oppose tax increases.
“That 17 senators could block the will of 133 other legislators and the governor is absurd,” Owen said. “That would be the case if the two-thirds requirement were made the other way, to lower taxes, or for any other policy matter to come before you. Locking in decisions now by representatives and senators who are elected for only two- and four-year terms disrespects future legislators and future voters who choose them, for years to come.”
Sen. Cindy Winckler, D-Davenport, who did not sign off on the bill, said the Iowa Legislature has always been “very judicious” in making tax policy decisions since she took office. However, she said Iowa, alongside the rest of the country, is in “uncharted waters” with cuts to federal aid and economic volatility caused by tariffs. Federal financial uncertainties, combined with Gov. Kim Reynolds’ budget proposal for fiscal year 2026 being higher than projected state revenues, show the need for Iowa lawmakers to have the ability to make the best tax decisions for Iowa.
“This causes me great concern, and I don’t necessarily think this is the time that we would pass something like this, that would take away one of the tools that we currently have,” Winckler said. “Always, we are very careful in increasing any kind of cost to Iowans. But we need to have the tools in the event that we need them.”
Tyler Raygor with Americans for Prosperity, a conservative organization, said the measure was a “prudent safeguard” for Iowa taxpayers. He said when tax increases may be necessary, he believed Iowa lawmakers would be able to reach a consensus, pointing to the deal reached in March 2020 to keep the state government funded during COVID-related shutdowns.
“In emergencies, we believe the Legislature can work together if it ever was necessary to raise taxes,” he said. “But in the event that it is, we think having a broad consensus requiring two-thirds is prudent.”
Raygor also pushed back against comments that the proposed constitutional amendment would unfairly restrict future lawmakers’ actions.
Jake Highfill with Iowans for Tax Relief was among other supporters of the measure who said amending Iowa’s constitution is a difficult process when compared to other states like California that allow ballot initiatives, meaning the measure will be difficult to reverse in the future.
“Something like this will outlive all of us,” Highfill said, calling the proposed constitutional amendment “one of the best policies you guys are going to pass this General Assembly.”
Sens. Jason Schultz, R-Schleswig, and Rocky De Witt, R-Lawton, voted to advance the bill. It will need approval by the full Ways and Means Committee before it advances to the Senate floor.
“I think people are waiting to vote on this, and it’s our job to get it to them on a ballot,” Schultz said.
In 2024, the original version of the amendment also included language that would have enshrined a flat income tax rate in the state constitution — preventing future lawmakers from returning to a graduated tax rate system that places a higher income tax rate on people with higher incomes. This proposal gained approval last year as a separate measure, Senate Joint Resolution 2004. Sen. Dan Dawson, R-Council Bluffs, said in 2024 these measures were separated so Iowans would have the opportunity to weigh in on both proposals as independent items on a ballot.
The proposed amendment requiring Iowa to have a single rate income tax has not been filed so far this session — it would also have to be passed by the lawmakers during the current general assembly to make it on to the ballot.

In a statement to StateImpact, Oklahoma State University spokesperson Mack Burke said eight OSU student visas have been recently revoked by the federal government. He did not provide further information as to the reasons behind the revocations or if the students had been deported.
According to the statement, OSU is monitoring the situation and “providing appropriate guidance and support to those impacted.”
The University of Central Oklahoma told StateImpact “as many as four” of its students have had visas revoked.
A recent report by Inside Higher Ed found roughly 150 students at 50 institutions have had their visas revoked, though the actual number is likely higher. Secretary of State Marco Rubio has said the U.S. has revoked 300 or more student visas, calling the affected persons “lunatics.”
A spokesperson for the University of Oklahoma said it was unable to confirm if any of its students have been affected due to student privacy laws.

(Photo by Dana Wormald/New Hampshire Bulletin)What could be more Republican than the two-year state budget under construction in Concord? Revenue is down, in part because the GOP keeps cutting and repealing taxes to help out corporations and the wealthy, and meanwhile hundreds of state positions are being cut, critical agencies eliminated, and spending on public services slashed. But guess what’s expanding? A school voucher program that siphons money away from public education and gives it to private and religious schools, at a budgeted cost of $91 million over the biennium.  
All this while the Republican-controlled federal government snatches back critical funding while extorting compliance from state governments and institutions, all to serve the whims of a couple of bomb-tossing billionaires.
Classic.
But this is exactly what the majority of people in America and New Hampshire chose last November, and voters can’t even claim to have been misled. This mess is what the GOP was openly selling, the whole time, and they found plenty of willing buyers.
So hats off to the Republicans, who are pretty awesome at winning elections. The fact that they win despite running against services that benefit the people themselves makes it all the more impressive. And it really all starts at the top.
“Make America Great Again” is just genius sloganeering, for the past decade inviting every disaffected, disillusioned, and disgruntled American to assign their favored era to the key word “again.” That little trick alone is worth countless millions of votes — and enduring, head-in-the-sand support — in this wistful society with its walleyed fixation on bleached past glories. But when you’re as talented as this administration at conjuring all of the supposed enemies (migrants, LGBTQ people, public educators, doctors, etc.) conspiring to block good, hard-working people from returning to the “again” times, that’s a sure-fire winner at the polls. 
Nostalgia + insecurity = electoral victory. It’s simple math.
Here in New Hampshire, all Republican Kelly Ayotte had to do to win the corner office in this environment was copy the blueprint, and so she came up with “Don’t Mass Up New Hampshire” and locked in on some of the same “threats” isolated by Trump. She even copied billionaire Elon Musk’s DOGE with millionaire Craig Benson’s COGE to attack that towering, undefined enemy known as The Bureaucracy. While Ayotte inherited some of what’s punitive in this state budget, it’s got her party’s fingerprints all over it. And she’s been a champion of the same bad policies that helped lead us here — tax cuts and repeals, the maniacal expansion of vouchers, arbitrarily redefining what it means to be “vulnerable” in order to legitimize cuts — while simultaneously avoiding the herd of elephants in the room: punishing property taxes, the prohibitive costs of scarce housing, a lack of investment in child care, etc. (So many etc.’s.)
Ayotte proved that you don’t need any new ideas to notch a W in the Granite State. It’s enough to be anti-Massachusetts.
Tax cuts + gutting public services and education + downshifting costs to property-tax payers + Massachusetts stinks = victory in New Hampshire. Again, that electoral math is straightforward. (The equation, slightly more complex than the president’s, is unironically called The New Hampshire Advantage.)
It would be a mistake, though, to assume what’s happening in Concord and D.C. is part of some painful transition to something else, something better. This, right now, is in fact the Republican destination. Always was.
If you think about the human predilection for compact narratives — the clarity of white-hat/black-hat politics and policies — it adds up that Republicans are good at winning elections. But unfortunately for all but the top wealth holders in the nation, their economic orthodoxy is incompatible with good governance. That’s true In New Hampshire just as it is in D.C. It’s not just the obvious terrible choices either, like the tariff mess, Musk’s triple-blindfolded piñata swings at crucial agencies and programs, or New Hampshire Republicans’ years of rich-guy tax cuts and repeals while non-wealthy property-tax payers get the shaft. It’s that the party’s foundational principles — tax cuts for the wealthy and smaller government to pay for those tax cuts — not only don’t do what Republicans argue they will (the enduring Reagan-era myth of trickle-down economics) but actually undermine the social safety net that’s meant to strengthen society at its foundation so we can build up from there.
You see, it’s one tiny slice of the American public that benefits from all these cuts, and it’s with them that the “savings” remain and multiply. Modern conservative economic philosophy, die-cast in fool’s gold nearly a half-century ago, makes sure that wealth in the richest country in the world flows in one direction and one direction only.
By design, the golden age promised to the masses — the Shangri-La of “Great Again” — is fused to a horizon just out of sight and forever out of reach.
Sometimes people write to me and say that I should take my “liberal” policies to Massachusetts where they belong. (Score one for Kelly!) I usually just thank them — sincerely — for reading the piece, because economically I’m on their side even if they don’t realize it. I don’t care much for party politics, and although Republican leaders are openly and brazenly against the public good, there have been enough times when Democrats have lost the trail.
I mean, there’s a reason Sen. Bernie Sanders felt the need to challenge Hillary Clinton in 2016. And Democrats haven’t done enough soul-searching about why Nancy Pelosi has waged a behind-the-scenes campaign against Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, one of the party’s most effective communicators, over the years. And the left should worry that political fundraising in the wake of Citizens United has pushed congressional Democrats toward the center and congressional Republicans further right.
There is, however, no comparison between the parties when it comes to draining public services for the sole purpose of further enriching the wealthy. It is what Republicans live for.

In early 2024, I was assigned to the Ramsey County Probation Unit represented by Teamsters Local 320. The unit had fallen into disarray from a lack of leadership from both county administration and the previous union reps.
More than 200 Ramsey Count probation officers serve in several specialty units within the Community Corrections Department. The officers supervise over 11,000 adult and juvenile clients.
Probation and parole is at the intersection of rehabilitation and law enforcement. 
Probation and parole has been subject to increased regulatory and administrative changes in the past few years. More probation officers are required to wear bullet-resistant vests and body-worn cameras, even as officers are moving away from punitive models to more holistic community supervision.
These system-wide changes had resulted in internal tensions and poor morale within the officer corps, exacerbated by a lack of leadership from agency managers and policymakers.
The question posed to me as I took over the assignment was: Could union solidarity promote unit cohesion and establish internal leadership? 
The answer is “yes!” Union solidarity brought pride and purpose to probation officers in Ramsey County.
When I first assumed the role of business agent with the probation unit, I was viewed with skepticism and suspicion.
I immediately got to work and dealt with every issue — no matter how large or small — to build credibility with the officer corps. I soon discovered most issues were valid, and that labor/management power dynamics were weighted heavily towards management.
Probation officers are classified as “non-essential” status in state statute, unlike peace officers, correctional officers, county prosecutors and public safety dispatchers. This means probation officers have the right to strike over collective bargaining disputes.
Building strike capacity for probation officers proved less difficult than initially anticipated due to the desire of the officer corps to reclaim identity as vital professionals for public safety and rehabilitation. And, they demanded self-determination in defining their work and its impact.
Collective bargaining disputes can amplify issues and solve others, but usually do not result in transformational change. That type of change is hard work and takes time, dedication and compromise.
I knew long before we organized for a strike action that we would eventually get an agreement, and once we did so, momentum would wane. So we had to systematize lasting change within the final agreement.
We needed regular meet-and-confer sessions with county officials to elevate professional development discussions above the heads of department leaders, who failed to listen to officer concerns. 
We also needed a new officer training program that would place a lasting imprint from the officer corps on the institutional instruction and best practices of all future officers. 
As strike planning ensued, the county dug in. This only further solidified the officer corps’ resolve to strike if necessary.
In full transparency, I am a supporter of the liberal power structure in Ramsey County. It has been a positive force for working people, but just as the officers refused to be defined by others, I too refused to allow Teamsters in Ramsey County to be defined by prevailing systems.
The threat to strike was made public after four months of negotiations and mediation. By that time, the county started to buckle and brought us close to attaining a settlement on all items including wages, but the county proposed a two-tiered professional development system for senior officers and less senior officers. This move would narrow the path for junior officers to professionally develop into the senior classification.
For a negotiation predicated upon professional identity, this was a red line. 
The officer corps had voted by 99% to empower the union bargaining committee to call a strike if necessary. 
After we filed our strike notice, we held a massive rally at the Saint Paul courthouse to amplify our issues to the press and legal establishment. Officers chanted, “Teamsters don’t break.” After the rally the officers marched into the courthouse rotunda and continued chanting. 
The echo from the chanting in those halls could be heard outside the building onto the street.
The strike was averted when the county presented acceptable language on professional development. 
During this year-long process, there are a few important details to mention.

The union negotiating team was formed organically within the officer corps. It was self-organized by competent and committed union members who brought experience and expertise to the process.


Had it become necessary, the officers would have executed a successful strike against Ramsey County and won the support of the community.


Bureaucratic inertia has become a hindrance to union mobilization.

Overall, union organization brought pride and unity to the officer corps, which will wind up paying major dividends for Ramsey County taxpayers, who can count on a professional officer corps dedicated to service. 
A last point: Union probationary employees, who are usually young people of color, remain unprotected. In Ramsey County the probationary period for a new probation officer is one year. I have witnessed probationary employees make it to their last month or week of probation only to be let go just before the deadline. I have seen this not just with Ramsey County, but at the Board of Public Defense, and the University of Minnesota.
Unfortunately, I have had to tell union probationary employees that until their probationary period is complete, they are at-will and have the same rights as fast food or Walmart workers. .
We should demand a just cause threshold for any employment termination. You want to fire someone? You should need just cause.  
In Montana, no liberal bastion, just cause is required to discharge any employee.
When workers have a union in Montana, their union will enforce just cause. If the worker does not have a union, then they can seek out legal representation to enforce their rights. 
Minnesota should implement just cause as a fundamental right to empower workers in all 87 counties.

One of them directs the Justice Department to challenge state climate policies.(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)President Donald Trump has launched an all-out legal attack on states’ authority to set climate change policy.
His executive order, issued Tuesday, directs the Department of Justice to challenge a huge swath of state laws and regulations. The order aims at measures that seek to cut carbon emissions, penalize energy companies and limit drilling permits. It also targets state-led lawsuits against fossil fuel companies over the damages caused by climate change.
Trump’s directive orders Attorney General Pam Bondi to “stop the enforcement” of any state laws related to climate change, including any that are seen as “burdening” the use of domestic energy resources. Such language could include state laws that mandate a transition to clean electricity sources.
The order specifically calls out “climate Superfund” policies in Vermont and New York, which require fossil fuel companies to pay for some of the damages caused by climate change. It also targets California’s cap-and-trade law, which places a limit on emissions through auctions of carbon credits.
Wind and solar power opponents make headway in state legislatures

While Trump’s order says such state policies are unconstitutional, climate-focused state leaders say his administration has no legal basis to unravel their efforts.
“The federal government cannot unilaterally strip states’ independent constitutional authority,” New York Gov. Kathy Hochul and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, both Democrats, wrote in a joint statement from the U.S. Climate Alliance. “We are a nation of states — and laws — and we will not be deterred.”
Hochul and Lujan Grisham co-chair the alliance, a coalition of 24 governors focused on reducing emissions.
Climate disasters are on the rise. These states want to make oil companies pay.

Michael Gerrard, faculty director of Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, told Politico that the order is “toothless.”
“[Trump] has no authority on his own to nullify state laws,” he told the outlet.
But the order throws the might of the federal government into a sprawling legal battle over states’ authority to set climate policy and seek damages for disasters.
It could force states to face expensive litigation and years of legal uncertainty. Trump-appointed judges on the U.S. Supreme Court and elsewhere have at times been hostile to environmental regulations. And it’s unclear whether the order will have a chilling effect on state efforts to craft more climate legislation.

(Micah Drew/ Daily Montanan)On the 69th day of the 69th legislative session, the Montana Senate adopted permanent rules for the chamber, more than three months after gaveling in to do business.
Less than 10 minutes into the start of the 2025 Legislature, the Senate was thrown into disarray when a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans blocked the GOP majority from passing the rules agreed upon by leadership. The dispute was mostly centered around committee assignments, which the coalition said diluted their ability to influence legislation.
The upper chamber has been operating under temporary rules ever since that first day, but finally reached an agreement this week on permanent rules.
“I think we’ve ironed out most of our differences,” said Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, during a press availability with reporters ahead of the vote. “It’s nice to have a set of rules you can take in the next session, get a rule book.”
On the Senate floor Tuesday, McGillvray outlined the changes to the existing rules structure, which included removing an Executive Review Committee that drew ire early on, changing several procedural deadlines for the chamber, and giving the minority leader approval over minority appointments to committees.
The new rules also require the Senate president to receive “advance concurrence,” or approval, from the minority leader on the composition of conference committees — a select group of lawmakers assigned to iron out amendments to bills if both chambers do not agree on a final product — giving Democrats more power heading into the final weeks of the session when more bills are expected to end up workshopped that way. Previously, the minority leader only had to be consulted.

(Photo: Aire images/ Getty)Voters in South Portland may be asked on the November ballot to choose between natural grass and artificial turf at the high school athletics complex, but that project could face a hiccup from Augusta with a bipartisan group of lawmakers trying to pause synthetic field projects. 
The Maine Legislature’s Environment and Natural Resources Committee held a public hearing Wednesday for a proposal to put a three-year moratorium on installing and replacing artificial turf fields while the Department of Environmental Protection studies whether it is a risk to public health and the environment.
“I urge you to consider the safety of both our children, our environment and to support this legislation,” said Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) when presenting LD 1177.
While supporters of the bill echoed Gramlich’s concern for microplastics and other chemicals that could leach into waterways and human bodies, its opponents wondered why that sort of analysis can’t be done without a moratorium that could cause costly disruptions to efforts to build and maintain these fields.
Gramlich said current data and studies about the potential risks from artificial turf is scattered, so asking the department to vet and compile those findings would make it easier for Mainers to access reliable information to apprise decisions in their communities. 
South Portland resident Mary Linneman spoke of the time-consuming research she and others in her community have undertaken to advocate for a natural grass field. She supports LD 1177 because delegating that work to the state could make the process more efficient for other communities who may face similar questions. 
Gramlich also spoke of health risks to children who play on these surfaces, such as increased chance of dehydration since artificial turf can get hotter than regular grass. Though, there is also evidence that natural grass could pose a greater risk of concussions, especially while playing football.  
A senior at Mount View High School in Thorndike told the committee he experiences more knee and hip pain after playing soccer on a turf field, when sharing the reasons why he is in support of the bill. 
Other proponents of the bill raised concerns about the toxic chemicals found in artificial turf including phthalates, which have been known to increase risks of cancer, asthma and other negative health outcomes. There was also discussion about the presence of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, also known as PFAS, in the artificial turf; however, fields with intentionally added PFAS will already be banned in the coming years under current state law.
Despite industry improvements to eliminate PFAS and move away from using recycled rubber in these fields, testing may not capture all types of forever chemicals, said Sarah Woodbury, vice president of policy and advocacy for Defend Our Health. At the same time, she said the organic materials to replace the rubber are often still treated with chemicals for durability.
Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford), a cosponsor of the bill, also expressed worries about these fields ending up in landfills when Maine is already facing a solid waste “crisis.” Turf fields generally need to be replaced every 10 years. 
Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Melanie Loyzim testified neither for nor against the bill. She said there are logical questions around using turf, but certain language in the bill should be clarified and the department would need more resources to complete the proposed work. 
Dennis Walton, athletic director for Biddeford Schools, argued it violates the principle of local control and fails to recognize the environmental hazards such as pesticides, mowing and high water usage needed to maintain natural fields. 
Superintendent Jeffrey Porter also opposed the bill because MSAD 51 is in the process of installing a turf field for the Cumberland-North Yarmouth district after a 20-person committee spent three months researching and deciding on a PFAS-free product to replace its current grass field that is in poor condition. 
Athletics facilities at the University of Maine are undergoing overdue maintenance, including the addition of artificial turf fields, said Samantha Warren, chief external and governmental affairs officer, testifying against the bill. She said the university contracted with manufacturers whose products align with the state’s current PFAS regulations, but this proposal would “move those goalposts” and cost the university more money to redesign the project. 
Additionally, artificial turf is important when recruiting students to play at the state’s only Division I school, Warren said.
While turf is used at many collegiate facilities across the country, professional athletes have come out against its use including the NFL Players Association and the U.S. Women’s National Soccer Team. 
Mayor Mark Dion said Portland has invested in artificial turf to provide safe, accessible and durable athletic spaces throughout the city. Rather than implementing a moratorium, Dion suggested in his written testimony that the state should collaborate with municipalities while trying to better understand the environmental impacts.

Drew Roach, R-Farmington, during floor session on March 13. Photo by Michele Jokinen/House Information Services. Minnesota Rep. Drew Roach, R-Farmington, and Sen. Bill Lieske, R-Lonsdale, called the Jan. 6 insurrection a “hoax” and repeated a false conspiracy theory that the Trump supporters who stormed the Capitol were “actors,” during a video podcast posted Monday on YouTube and the popular right wing platform Rumble.   
Lieske and Roach host a show called “Minnesota Liberty Network.” On Monday, the two discussed the state Senate floor vote on a resolution condemning President Donald Trump’s blanket pardon of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes related to the Jan. 6. insurrection. Lieske was absent for the vote, and all 22 of the Republicans present voted against the resolution.
“If I would have been there, probably would have ended up voting no. I think that was such a stupid resolution,” Lieske said on the podcast. 
Roach then launched into an explanation of why he believes the Jan. 6. was a “hoax.” 
“You had people that were actors that were wearing the uniform of the Trump supporter that made it look like they were there to support Donald Trump,” Roach said. 
MAGA supporters at the time were upset with mask mandates, Roach said, arguing that because some insurrectionists were wearing masks, “those were not real, true MAGA Donald Trump conservative supporters.”
As evidence for the “hoax” hypothesis, Roach cited the timing of the Capitol breach — while Congress was debating whether to certify the election results in Arizona, which Joe Biden won — and floor speeches made by members of Congress immediately after the riot, all using the word “insurrection.” 
“It was all prepared,” Lieske said. 
“I had never heard the term insurrection in my life until that day,” Roach said. 
He continued: “So you’re telling me you were scared for your life, you were in the basement calling your family, but you were rewriting a new speech? I call bullshit.”
Around 140 law enforcement officers were injured in the insurrection, and more than 1,500 people were charged with crimes ranging from disorderly conduct to carrying a weapon on Capitol grounds and assaulting a law enforcement officer. More than 1,000 pleaded guilty, with 281 cases going to trial. 
Among those convicted were 14 members of the far-right organizations Proud Boys and Oath Keepers; members of a Telegram group chat called “PATRIOTS 45 MAGA Gang” who brought tactical gear to the Capitol to “violently remove traitors”; and numerous people who posted on their personal social media accounts or livestreamed while breaching the Capitol.
The U.S. Capitol Police chief testified Tuesday that Trump’s pardons had negative repercussions on morale within the department and for police across the country.
“I think there was an impact, not only to the Capitol Police, but an impact nationwide when you see folks that are pardoned — and I’m really referring to the ones that were convicted of assaulting police officers,” J. Thomas Manger said during a hearing on the department’s budget request.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-1.50.26 PM-1024x439.png,,,2025-04-09 15:14:16.495208

Laura Kelly signs pair of campaign finance bills in addition to legislation on municipal government whistleblowers and fees assessed on KORA requests.,"SenSen. Tim Shallenburger, R-Baxter Springs, welcomed Gov. Laura Kelly's signature on a bill designed to shield municipal government employees in Kansas who step forward as whistleblowers to expose wrongdoing, unlawful behavior or misappropriation of funds. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly signed a bill doubling campaign contribution limits to statewide and legislative candidates and a separate bill establishing new boundaries for the state commission responsible for enforcing campaign finance law.
The content of House Bill 2054 and House Bill 2206 was a point of contention at the Capitol because the Kansas Governmental Ethics Commission — renamed the Kansas Public Disclosure Commission by the legislation — had launched a controversial and politically sensitive investigation of Republican officials, consultants and activists for potentially coordinating campaign cash in ways contrary to state law.
The final version of HB 2054, which passed the House on a vote of 72-52 and the Senate by a margin of 26-14, increased aggregate limits for donations in primary and general elections from $2,000 to $4,000 for candidates for statewide office, including governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state, insurance commissioner and state treasurer.
Donations to candidates for Kansas House, district court judge, district attorney and local offices in jurisdictions of less than 50,000 people were doubled to $1,000 from the current cap of $500. In contests for Kansas Senate, the state Board of Education as well as local office candidates in positions with a population greater than 50,000, the limit also doubled to $2,000 from $1,000.
The bill raised the amount of cash a person could donate to a candidate or candidate committee for any primary or general election from $100 to $200.
In addition, the law eliminated limits on political party committees making donations to candidates in general elections. The bill declared expenditures by a Republican or Democratic committee in support of a candidate wouldn’t be counted as contributions. The law raised to $35,000 per calendar year how much a person could give to a state party committee and political committee of the House and Senate.
The governor also signed HB 2206, which was development to constrain the state commission tasked with regulating Kansas campaign-finance law.
This bill created a new definition for “cooperation or consent” in relation to express advocacy expenditures. For example, it would exclude a candidate’s or political party’s expenditures in response to inquiries about positions on legislative issues or the endorsement of a candidate.
This legislation also changed the way Kansas viewed contributions given in the name of another person. The bill raised the limit from $10 to $50 the amount political contribution an individual could accept without knowing the identity of the donor.
 Municipal whistleblower
Meanwhile, Kelly signed House Bill 2160 to establish the Municipal Employee Whistleblower Act. It extended legal protection for municipal employees who reported or revealed unlawful or dangerous conduct.
“This bipartisan bill will enhance transparency and accountability in local government, ensuring that municipal employees can report wrongdoing without fear of retaliation,” Kelly said. “Protecting whistleblowers is vital for maintaining public trust, safeguarding taxpayer resources, and promoting ethical governance.”
Historically, whistleblower protections had been limited to state and federal employees and were aimed at protecting people who reported misconduct or corruption from retaliatory actions. The bill sought to distinguish whistleblowers from disgruntled employers unhappy with lawful decisions.
“Municipal employees don’t have to fear reprisal any more for exposing wrongdoing, unlawful behavior, or misappropriation of funds,” said Sen. Tim Shallenburger, a Republican from Baxter Springs. “This piece of legislation gives the necessary protection to those, who in good faith, bring to light what the government wants to keep in the dark.”
The governor signed House Bill 2134 to limit fees charged by a public agency in response to Kansas Open Records Act requests and allowed a person requesting a record to appeal a fee’s reasonableness to the secretary of the Kansas Department of Administration if the material in question was linked to the executive branch.
In addition, the bill altered state law so a public agency wouldn’t be required to disclose closed investigations of violations of civil law or administrative regulations when no violation was found. In addition, the list of exempted records was expanded to include material viewed as obscene.
Kelly signed House Bill 2149 to modernize state law on installation of solar panels on a home or business. She endorsed Senate Bill 114 to authorize nonpublic and virtual school students to take part in public school activities.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/P4060215-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 15:14:16.495208

Bingham will replace Bryan Slone, who earlier had announced his departure from the chamber following seven years in that position. Slone said he planned to pursue other possibilities in Nebraska, including a possible political bid, though he didn’t provide details.
Slone, in a statement, said he was pleased about Bingham’s appointment. He said Bingham’s connections across the country and experience in urban and rural business development make him a great choice to continue the chamber’s work.
Joel Russell, chamber chair, said: “Todd is a wonderful addition to the Nebraska Chamber, bringing backgrounds in public policy and manufacturing, two of the chamber’s largest endeavors.” 
Bingham comes with 30 years of experience as a registered lobbyist. He has been an advocate for business and industry, specializing in governmental and regulatory affairs.
According to a chamber news statement, Bingham has served as national chair of the Council of State Manufacturing Associations and is a current board member of the National Association of Manufacturers.
He has served on various state boards and councils, including the Utah Employers Council and an OSHA advisory board, and has contributed to such groups as the Utah Labor Commission’s Workers’ Compensation Advisory Council.

(Photo by Robert Zullo/States Newsroom)OKLAHOMA CITY — Differing ideas of how to create residential setbacks for wind turbines have advanced through the Oklahoma House and Senate, but the chambers have yet to find a compromise on bill language. 
The Senate bill would create statewide setbacks a quarter of a nautical mile, which is slightly more than a quarter of a mile, from residential dwellings and nonparticipating properties, but allows property owners to waive these setbacks. The House version has larger setbacks and would not affect the whole state, but is targeted by population density in counties. 
Rep. Brad Boles, R-Marlow, asked the House Energy Committee to move the Senate version forward to continue conversations with the opposite chamber. 
“What I will say about Senate Bill 2 is it’s not our final language, we still are in negotiation with the Senate,” he said. “They have our bill that we passed, which we’re working with them on that language as well trying to get a compromise between both chambers. I will say on record, we do not have a compromise between both chambers at this point.” 
The continued legislative disagreement over bill details comes as pressure mounts on lawmakers to regulate one of the state’s most prominent renewable energy industry. 
The House sent its own proposed regulations version to the Senate, which would require turbines to be at least 1.5 times the tower’s height from nonparticipating properties and half a nautical mile from occupied buildings. County commissioners could refer the issue to a vote of county residents under this plan. 
The House version has been referred to the Senate Energy Committee, but has not been heard yet as of Wednesday. 
Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow, said he and Boles have visited with Senate leaders and was supportive of moving the bill out of a House committee to push the conversation forward. 
“This bill does have some things we need to improve about it. I much prefer the House version of the bill,” he said. “They did commit to giving a hearing to the House version of this legislation, but Rep. Boles and I did commit to doing what we could to help keep this bill alive through the process so we can continue to have a vehicle and then make changes as necessary.”
Rep. Dick Lowe, R-Amber, who was one of the four House committee members to vote against the Senate’s plan, said he didn’t like that the House version would not affect the whole state, but didn’t like the length of the Senate’s setbacks. 
Rep. Jared Deck, D-Norman, who voted against the plan, said the legislation creating these setbacks miss out on the opportunity to create wealth for landowners. He compared wind energy to mineral rights which have been “wealth building multi-generationally for families around the state.” 
Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, has previously said the setback proposed by the Senate is “more rational.” He said the proposed House setbacks “pretty well bans the industry.”

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)Discussion of legislation to afford the Wabanaki Nations more authority over their land revealed that Gov. Janet Mills does not support the change, presenting a steep path for a plan that otherwise has bipartisan support. 
After not testifying during the public hearing last week, the governor’s counsel, Jerry Reid, told the Judiciary Committee on Wednesday that Mills’ concerns stem from the inability to predict the future needs of state government, an issue also raised in written testimony from the Maine Department of Transportation, which was made available after the hearing. 
When pressed by committee members, Reid said he doesn’t have a specific example of an infrastructure project that would warrant seizing tribal land but that, “We need to write the law mindful for potential for problems.” 
While Reid and Wabanaki leaders noted that progress has and continues to be made to improve the relationship between the state and Wabanaki Nations, Reid added, “the fact that we have such a good relationship right now might not always be true.”
The U.S. government can seize private property for public use, a principle known as eminent domain, however that authority is restricted by the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which requires just compensation for land taken, as well as some federal laws.
The 1834 federal Indian Nonintercourse Act prohibited land transactions with tribes unless authorized by Congress. However, the 1980 Maine Indian Claims Settlement Act specified that that federal law was not applicable to the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians, the Passamaquoddy Tribe and the Penobscot Nation.

This is the act that has overall resulted in the Tribes being treated more akin to municipalities than sovereign nations. So far, sweeping changes to the act have failed due to opposition from Mills, but the governor, lawmakers and Wabanaki leaders have successfully made some targeted adjustments, including expanding tribal authority to prosecute crimes last year. 
The legislation being considered this session, LD 958, would amend the Settlement Act to prohibit the state from exercising eminent domain on trust and reservation land, which is protected under federal law, though fee land — or private property for which the owner owns the title — would still be subject to the state taking.
The bill would also amend the 2023 Mi’kmaq Nation Restoration Act to make this change for the Mi’kmaq Nation, which wasn’t included in the Settlement Act.
On Tuesday, the Taxation Committee unanimously voted in favor of a bill to ensure equal tax treatment among all of the Wabanaki Nations, which Mills supports. LD 982 would provide the Mi’kmaq Nation the same rights to sales tax revenue on its land that the other three tribes of the Wabanaki Nations were granted in 2022 through an amendment to the Settlement Act.
State hasn’t exercised this authority in decades, but argues it’s necessary
The state hasn’t exercised eminent domain over tribal lands since the Settlement Act. However, testimony from Wabanaki leaders and state government officials underscore that it is a possibility. 
In its testimony, MDOT raised concern about the uncertainty over the future location of tribal trust land, which is land the federal government holds the legal title of on behalf of a tribe. 
Bipartisan lawmakers, Wabanaki leaders propose next change to Settlement Act

Each of the Wabanaki Nations are eligible to acquire up to 150,000 acres of trust land in specific areas identified in the Settlement Act. Several tribes have already acquired most of that. 
“It is impossible to know how the eventual location of these lands could impact public transportation needs in coming years, and certainly not decades into the future,” wrote Meghan Russo, director of government affairs at MDOT.
Reid said the governor shares that concern. While noting that Mills doesn’t like the concept of eminent domain, he said, “it’s one of those things that when you need it, it suddenly is critically important and it’s an essential tool that government needs in order to be able to deliver on the needs of modern society.”
The governor believes the state needs to be mindful of the interests of the 1.4 million non-tribal Maine citizens as well, Reid said, to which Passamaquoddy Tribal Rep. Aaron Dana questioned whether the relatively small acreage the tribes could acquire would make a sizable impact on the state’s ability to do so. 
“We don’t know,” Reid said, “but it could be.” 
While arguing for the state’s right to eminent domain over tribal land, Reid emphasized the state’s record in the past several decades of negotiating with the Tribes rather than exercising that authority, an apparent contradiction pointed out by lawmakers.
“If the state is saying that they won’t do this and they don’t need to and they would never be bad neighbors like that, then ask the state, why can’t they abide by this law?” questioned the bill sponsor, House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor). “Then put it into statute that they won’t do that, because if you need some land or access to some land for a project or something, then go to them and make a deal and buy it.”
Faulkingham also pushed back on what he described as a false notion of trust land being the “boogie man,” given the limited acreage permitted to the Tribes.  
While eminent domain of tribal land hasn’t been used recently, Maine’s proposal to build an offshore wind port, although effectively stalled at the moment, has given the Wabanaki Nations cause for concern. 
Reiterating worry shared by William Nicholas, chief of the Passamoquoddy Tribe at Indian Township, during the bill hearing, Passamaquoddy attorney Corey Hinton said on Wednesday that the state did not appropriately involve the Wabanaki Nations in planning discussions, particularly when considering Estes Head in Eastport as a possible location. 
The more distant past should also not be dismissed, Hinton added. 
“The State of Maine has numerous times relied on the taking of tribal lands and resources to promote industrialization and infrastructure development,” Hinton said. “It’s a simple fact of the history of Maine.” 
A related line of questioning revealed the persistent tension around tribal sovereignty. 
Rep. Adam Lee (D-Auburn) said, for him, this bill is easy: the state of Maine can’t take another government’s land. 
“I fundamentally think of our relationship with the tribes as a government to government relationship,” Lee said. 










The State of Maine has numerous times relied on the taking of tribal lands and resources to promote industrialization and infrastructure development. It's a simple fact of the history of Maine.


– Corey Hinton, attorney and citizen of Passamaquoddy Tribe


“We can’t take a part of New Hampshire. We can’t take a part of Greenland or Panama,” Lee added, referring to President Donald Trump’s desires to do so, a comment that received some laughs from other committee members.
Reid argued that Lee’s view is overly simplistic since the federal government has the authority of eminent domain. 
An argument about relative permanence 
The Mills administration, lawmakers and tribes are also at odds regarding whether changes to the Settlement Act are permanent. 
“An amendment to the main implementing act is, for all intents and purposes, a permanent change in the law,” Reid said. “It’s the only context in which you all can bind future legislatures. It is a more profound commitment than an amendment to the state constitution, which can be undone by the will of the Maine voters.” 
Russo with MDOT also made the same point in written testimony, that the Legislature cannot unilaterally repeal or amend the new language if issues arise once implemented. 
Federal law authorizes the Maine Legislature to make changes to the Settlement Act and Mi’kmaq Restoration Act but only with the consent of the affected Tribes.
Dana, the representative for the Passamaquoddy Tribe, asked Reid how he squared that idea of permanence with the fact that the Legislature is currently with this bill deciding whether to amend the Settlement Act, and has made changes in the recent past. 
“That’s one of the biggest things that you and your office really fight against with the Tribes, yet we have the ability to make those changes as of right now, and why can’t we do those in the future?” Dana questioned. 
Mills’ philosophy when it comes to the Settlement Act has been to ensure any changes and consequences are understood by all parties, Reid said, adding that the consequences are too uncertain for the governor in this instance.  
“I take your point that it’s theoretically possible that, with the consent of the Tribes, this amendment could be repealed,” Reid said, “but presumably, if there comes a point when there’s a contentious issue involving the use of eminent domain in the future the affected Tribe wouldn’t be in a position to agree to repeal this law because they wouldn’t be on the same page as the state.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed 41 more bills into law Tuesday, including several to boost New Mexico’s ability to install solar panels in small communities and allow utilities to seek rate changes for technology to improve electricity transmission. 
She has until April 11 to sign or veto legislation.
House Bill 128 establishes a $20 million dollar fund to provide grants for solar energy and battery storage for tribal, rural and low-income schools, municipalities and counties. 
“This fund is an investment in our infrastructure, our economy, and our future,” Sen. Harold Pope (D-Albuquerque) one of the bill’s sponsors, said in a statement. “It fills crucial funding gaps for rural and underserved areas, ensuring that all communities — no matter their zip code — can implement solar projects that cut energy costs, lower emissions, and enhance our resilience during fires, blackouts, and intense storms. I’m proud that we passed it.”
House Bill 93 will allow larger electric utilities to incorporate advanced grid technology projects into their grid modernization plans, and incorporate those plans into the ratemaking process before the Public Regulation Commission.
Co-sponsor Kristina Ortez (D-Taos) told Source the alternative: building more transmission lines can be “100 times to 1,000 times more expensive” than using technologies that boost lines capacity to carry more electricity, and state law allows electricity companies to pass on those costs to customers.
“Advanced grid technologies are way cheaper for ratepayers,” Ortez said. “These utilities now have incentives to try to make their existing lines more efficient rather than building a whole new one.”
HB93 is limited to investor-owned utilities, such as Public Service Company of New Mexico Xcel Energy and El Paso Electric, and does not impact smaller electric cooperatives, she noted.
The governor also signed : House Bill 10, which establishes a new enforcement division under the state’s Regulation and Licensing Bureau to enforce state cannabis laws; House Bill 63, which proposes changes to the public school funding formula to generate more money for low-income, English-language learning students and students in seventh through 12th grades; andSenate Bill 19, which requires that members of university governing boards undergo 10 hours of training on ethics, student services and best practices. 
Four of the bills she enacted related to water treatment for ongoing climate impacts, addressing so-called “forever chemicals” contamination and pollution control.

Senate Bill 25-276 passed its first legislative committee on a party-line vote Tuesday night. It needs to clear the Senate Appropriations Committee before getting a full debate on the chamber floor.
“We’ve seen the Trump administration wield attacks against immigrants, regardless of their immigration status, with increasing frequency and with less and less regard for due process,” Sen. Julie Gonzales, a Denver Democrat, told supporters and journalists ahead of the committee hearing.
“This bill creates clarity amidst the chaos, confusion and uncertainty that our communities are facing,” she said.

Gonzales is running the bill alongside Sen. Mike Weissman, an Aurora Democrat, Rep. Lorena Garcia, an Adams County Democrat, and Rep. Elizabeth Velasco, a Glenwood Springs Democrat.
It comes in the wake of immigration raids in the Denver metro area and the arrest of immigration activist Jeanette Vizguerra outside her work in March. Colorado university students have had their visas revoked, following a national push by the Trump administration to target students who have protested against Israel’s war on Gaza and other contentious issues.
A CBS 60 Minutes report recently found that of the over 200 people that federal authorities transported to a prison in El Salvador, only about 22% have a criminal history in the United States, mostly for non-violent crimes. Some of the people detained in Colorado also had no criminal record, as reported by Colorado Public Radio.
“What we know about the administration’s actions thus far — and good luck trying to find the truth right because it’s a new thing every day — they’re not targeted just to people who’ve committed offenses, despite what they say. They put fear into a broader universe of people,” Weissman said.
Builds on previous laws
Colorado has existing laws that restrict local law enforcement cooperation with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, prohibiting them from arresting a person on behalf of immigration authorities or holding them in jail past their release time so ICE can pick them up. SB-276 would further clarify that local law enforcement cannot delay a person’s release for an immigration enforcement operation. It would also restrict ICE from physical access to non-public spaces in a jail without a warrant.
“When a person posts bond, they need to be released. That’s it. That’s how we roll in the United States of America. And so when those jails are holding people for up to six hours to facilitate ICE apprehension, the jail and the county commissioners for that jail are looking at a Fourth Amendment lawsuit,” immigration lawyer Hans Meyer said. “This is a way for us to make sure that those lines are clear. I don’t like ICE, but ICE can do their job as long as they’re doing their job lawfully.”
State agencies are not allowed to share personally-identifying information — data that is not publicly available such as a birthday, tax identification number, vehicle registration information or fingerprints — with immigration authorities. The bill would extend that prohibition to local governments.
It would also repeal requirements that a person without permanent legal status submit an affidavit saying they intend to, or already have, applied for status when seeking in-state tuition at a public university in the state or for a driver’s license.
“These affidavits serve no constructive purpose, no public benefit, all while collecting sensitive data and private information that potentially exposes individuals to constitutional rights violations,” Velasco said.
Additionally, the bill would prevent federal immigration officers from accessing non-public spaces in schools, hospitals and child care centers without a warrant. Many supporters testified on Tuesday that fear of detention and deportation has created a chilling effect in the immigrant community, creating fear around attending school and seeking medical care.
The bill would also allow immigrants to ask a court to vacate a guilty plea for some additional misdemeanors not currently allowed under law, traffic violations and petty offenses if they weren’t advised by their lawyers of immigration consequences of that plea.
Guilty pleas can make it nearly impossible for immigrants to obtain legal status, such as a green card and eventually apply for citizenship. Aubrey Lesso said her husband’s marijuana conviction from a decade ago prevented him from getting permanent residence after their marriage.
“My husband wasn’t advised of the immigration consequences of this petty offense, so he pleaded guilty and, as he was a minor, all he needed to do was pay a fine instead of going to more court dates,” she said. “We have spent almost four years trying to clean up my husband’s record, but he still doesn’t have a pathway to status.”
That has created a ripple effect, she said, because her husband can’t get a Social Security number or work authorization.
“I always fear that my husband will be detained by ICE, leaving me and my son alone,” she said.
Republicans vote against bill
The bill would set civil penalties, up to $50,000, for violations that would go to the state’s Immigrant Legal Defense Fund. The Colorado Municipal League asked for an amendment Tuesday to exempt local government employees from that liability.
The testimony on Tuesday was almost entirely in support of the bill, including from immigrant rights groups, education advocacy organizations, and groups like the ACLU of Colorado.
Three organizations are officially registered in opposition to the bill: the town of Castle Rock, Strong Advocates For Enforcement in Colorado, or SAFE Colorado, and the Colorado Association of Chiefs of Police.
“This bill is not about civil rights, as its supporters claim. It is about shielding criminal illegal aliens under the guise of virtue signaling,” said John Fabbricatore, a former ICE regional director and leader of SAFE Colorado.
Republican Sens. Rod Pelton of Cheyenne Wells and Byron Pelton of Sterling voted against the bill in committee, a likely foreshadow to universal Republican opposition in the Senate.
Democrats hold majorities in both the Senate and House and do not need Republican votes to pass legislation. The bill now heads to the Senate Appropriations Committee.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Legislation regulating a marijuana-like drug already available throughout Indiana inched closer to reality Wednesday, after clearing its third committee vote — and another round of revisions — in the House. It next heads to the chamber’s floor.
Delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol — the major psychoactive component in marijuana — remains illegal in Indiana. But the delta-8 THC business is booming.
Attempts to regulate the isomer have failed repeatedly, typically in the Senate. But when Senate Bill 478 crossed out of that chamber, House lawmakers got to work.
Committees focused on commerce and finance vetted the measure, making substantive changes each time. On Wednesday, the House Courts and Criminal Code Committee got its turn, approving another set of edits intended to curry Senate support and avoid potentially messy negotiations.
“I certainly am one that thinks that the status quo is unacceptable,” Rep. Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty, told the committee. “And so, we need to get this bill in a position where we can get a concurrence over in the Senate.”
Senate Bill 478 sets out advertising, age-limit, licensing, packaging, testing and other requirements for the hemp-derived products. The Indiana Alcohol and Tobacco Commission would gain regulatory power over the industry.

A major amendment, taken by consent on Wednesday, sets a cap on the number of retail permits at 9,400. Chris Serrack, the commission’s deputy director, said that’s an estimate of how many retailers carry the products today — about 75% of the current 12,000 tobacco certificate holders. The calculation doesn’t include alcoholic beverage permittees with on-premise-only services, he said.
The first-come, first-serve system would function in contrast to the population-based model governing alcohol permits. Doing that for delta-8 would be “burdensome,” per Serrack, because it requires auctions and records-keeping.
Several committee members feared those factors combined would lock businesses already selling the products out of the industry.
The amended legislation also blocks the commission from issuing permits to grocery stores larger than 2,500 square feet or to any drug stores. It limits eligibility to convenience stores, and to current alcoholic beverage permittees for on-premise consumption.
When asked why, Teshka told the committee, “Again, … my interest here is that we get a concurrence in the Senate.”
The rationale, he continued, “is that, you know, we want to limit the proliferation of these products. So, where they’re being sold now is where we should keep them.”
Another provision would require permit-holders to keep all craft hemp invoices and make them available for commission inspection. Other additions offer punishments for products “adulterated” with illegal substances and bans driving under the influence of any craft hemp products.
The amendment also removed tax language added last week by the House Ways and Means Committee. Teshka said the provision would get moved elsewhere because new taxes must go in House-originated legislation.
Rep. Matt Pierce, D-Bloomington, accentuated the rare third round of committee vetting while questioning Serrack about the new penalties.
  Rep. Wendy McNamara leads a committee hearing on Wednesday, March 19, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
“I had a quick question on the penalties, since I guess that’s what this committee is supposed to worry about the most,” Pierce quipped. “Were you involved in figuring out what the penalty should be?”
Serrack affirmed his agency’s involvement, and that the penalties were essentially mirrored from existing alcohol law.
Earlier, Teshka indicated a third hearing wasn’t always the plan.
“I appreciate you all. I know we’re getting to the end (of the legislative session) and we put an extra meeting on your calendar that wasn’t there before,” he told lawmakers, one day before the Thursday committee hearing deadline.
Rep. Wendy McNamara told the Capital Chronicle that Senate Bill 478 was recommitted to her committee because it would create a new penalty structure. She said any new felonies typically come her way.
The committee advanced the legislation on a 9-3 tally. Republicans were all three “no” votes.
It heads to the House floor for potential further amendments, then a final vote. If the House’s numerous changes don’t earn a Senate concurrence, representation from each chamber would have to negotiate a final version.

(iStock/Getty Images Plus)Colorado health officials warned Tuesday that measles may be spreading undetected in Colorado following the confirmation of the state’s third case this year in an Archuleta County resident.
The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s warning comes after two previous measles cases in Pueblo and Denver. Unlike in those two cases, the Archuleta County resident, an adult whose vaccination status has not been confirmed, did not recently travel internationally.
“This case does not appear to be linked to the other cases reported in Colorado and the individual did not travel outside of Colorado, which leaves open the possibility of community transmission,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “We urge Coloradans to monitor for symptoms if they may have been exposed, and to make sure they are up to date on their (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations.”



Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine provide about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado has not had three measles cases confirmed in the same calendar year in at least 12 years, according to state data.
The infections come amid an alarming rise in measles outbreaks nationwide, including several clusters in west Texas and neighboring states that have caused at least two deaths of unvaccinated children. Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. While state law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, it allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
CDPHE officials say people may have been exposed to measles at the Wolf Creek Ski Area and Resort between March 28 and 30; the Pagosa Springs City Market on March 31; and the Pagosa Medical Group clinic at 27B Talisman Dr. on March 31 and April 2. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

The Hamilton County Principals Association represents principals in 79 public schools in the Chattanooga-area district of Republican Sen. Bo Watson, who is cosponsor of Senate Bill 836.
The bill would require public charter and K-12 schools to verify student immigration status and allow them to charge tuition — or deny enrollment entirely — to children who cannot provide proof of their legal immigration status.

“Our schools are not only institutions of learning — they are the heart of our neighborhoods, and they reflect our shared values of inclusion, dignity, and opportunity for all,” a news release from the principals’ association said.
“Denying this right not only contradicts our professional ethics and moral responsibilities, but also violates legal precedent grounded in the U.S. Constitution,” the release said, citing the 14th Amendment’s equal protection guarantees and Supreme Court precedent.
Watson and the bill’s cosponsor, House Leader William Lamberth, have said they hope the bill will be challenged in court and go onto serve as a vehicle to overturn the 1982 Supreme Court Plyler v. Doe decision that established all children have equal access to a public education, regardless of immigration status. The sponsors have also cited rising costs of English-language learning in public schools, but acknowledged there is currently no way to ascertain the immigration status of children receiving the instruction.
The two versions of the bill different in one key respect:  The House bill would make it optional to check student immigration status. The Senate version makes this mandatory in Tennessee’s more than 1700 public school and all public charter schools. Both bills allow schools to charge tuition or bar enrollment.
‘Economically reckless’ Small businesses slam bill to bar immigrant kids from school

The bill earlier this week drew opposition from more than two dozen small business owners in Watson’s district represented by the Tennessee Small Business Alliance. The alliance called the measure “economically reckless.”
On Monday, more than 240 Tennessee faith leaders issued an open letter to state lawmakers opposing the measure, which they called “cruel” and antithetical to their religious values.
And on Tuesday, a group of Montgomery County residents filed a complaint against Republican Rep. Aron Maberry with the Tennessee Ethics Commission over his support for the measure, alleging his support for the measure violates the School Board Code of Ethics that spells out a duty to provide equal education opportunities to all students.
The bill has drawn majority, but not unanimous support, from Tennessee Republicans. On Monday, the bill narrowly passed a House Committee with Rep. Jeremy Faison, a Republican from Cosby, noting that “nobody in my district asked me to vote for that bill” before he cast a “no” vote.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A bill that would regulate the psychoactive herb known as kratom vetoed last year by Gov. Dan McKee returned to the Rhode Island State House Tuesday night.
And things are different this time around, the lawmakers sponsoring the kratom legislation in the Rhode Island House and Senate assured colleagues in a pair of concurrent committee meetings. Last year’s version went six pages. The new iteration is 25 pages. 
“The governor did not love it,” Senate President Pro Tempore Hanna Gallo, a Cranston Democrat, said of the 2024 bill she sponsored and McKee later vetoed. “So we have worked for a whole year. The Rhode Island Kratom Act is the result of a year-long compromise developed in collaboration with the administration to replace prohibition with sensible regulations.”
Gallo returned as lead sponsor on this year’s bill, The Rhode Island Kratom Act, which was heard by the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services Tuesday. The House companion is sponsored by Rep. Brian Patrick Kennedy, a Westerly Democrat, and was heard by the House Committee on Corporations.    
Kratom is a plant-derived drug with dose-dependent effects that can range from stimulating to sedating to euphoric. Thanks to its activity at the brain’s opioid receptors, people who are attempting to stop using or recovering from opioids sometimes use kratom as a replacement therapy. 
As of February 2024, Rhode Island is one of six states plus the District of Columbia that officially ban kratom. But it remains in legal limbo in many other states that don’t regulate it at all, allowing gray markets to dominate consumer supply — one reason why advocates want strict regulations in place.
Regulation advocates argue the danger of the kratom market lies in wildly potent formulations that are synthesized beyond naturally occurring limits in kratom-containing plants. Although the plant contains at least 45 alkaloids, or nitrogen-based chemical compounds, responsible for its psychoactive effects, most legislation aims to control two active ingredients in kratom products, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH).
Last year, a last-minute advocacy push generated enough support in both the Rhode Island House and Senate for bills posed as consumer protection legislation and based on similar, successful legislation passed in multiple states. Both the House and Senate bills passed on the final night of the legislative session in June, but McKee vetoed the bills about a week later.
Both the House and Senate sponsors pointed to the collaboration that led to this year’s version of the bill.

“I had the opportunity to sit with the governor and some of his staff, and he said, ‘Let’s work on this and try to create a piece of legislation that will work for the state of Rhode Island,’” Kennedy told his fellow state representatives on the House Committee on Corporations.
Kennedy said, adding that multiple state departments, including taxation and health officials, had also offered input on the bill. McKee wrote in his veto letter last year that one of his reasons he defeated the bill was that several state agencies requested a veto because of the bills’ lack of clarity on regulatory power. Which departments would be responsible for what? 
Olivia DaRocha, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, offered a more neutral assessment when asked for comment Tuesday ahead of the bill hearings.
“The Governor will review the bill in its final form if it reaches his desk,” DaRocha wrote. 
Mac Haddow, who spoke on behalf of the American Kratom Association, offered senators yet another interpretation: “The governor has indicated that the bill that’s before you today is acceptable to him, and if it passes the legislature, he will sign it.”
Haddow is not one of the two lobbyists listed in the Secretary of State’s portal who are paid $4,500 an hour to rally on behalf of the kratom association. Instead, Haddow serves as the organization’s senior fellow on public policy, and his name appears on testimony documents from legislatures across the country, like Kansas, North Dakota and Pennsylvania. 
But kratom advocacy exceeds U.S. borders — Matthew Lowe, the executive director of the Global Kratom Coalition, is based in South Africa, for instance. 
“I will say that the bill is complicated. It goes really far, 22 pages,” Lowe said in a phone interview ahead of Tuesday’s hearings. 
Lowe didn’t attend the hearings, but previewed many of the arguments made by proponents in committee hearings, including a 2024 Food and Drug Administration preliminary study of 40 people that found kratom to be tolerated well at most doses, though mild nausea was observed around 12 grams, a very high dose. With new research reinforcing the relative safety of the drug, Lowe argued, now’s the time to legalize and regulate, rather than leave kratom confined to black or gray markets where consumers buy products of questionable purity.   
That’s why the Kratom Consumer Protection Act has passed in multiple state legislatures, Lowe said: “I think it’s even less about the advocacy and more about the science. I think the science is developing,” Lowe added.
What about kratom cocktails?
Representing the Global Kratom Coalition’s interests at Tuesday’s hearings was Legislative Director Walker Gallman, who relayed that the revised bill is good, but still needs tweaking. Bill sponsor Kennedy, however, didn’t want to humor one of Gallman’s suggestions that would enable the sale of products that mix kratom with other substances. 
Kennedy asked Gallman if the industry sought to enable beverages that mix kratom with kava, another plant-based drug used as a mild tranquilizer. 
“That would be one of the products, yes. There are others,” Gallman said, noting that one of the coalition’s manufacturers makes a kratom-kava drink that has “safety studies.”
Kennedy said his bill was crafted with the state health department, and he’d prefer to keep its suggested language intact. Kratom cocktails would have to wait for future legislation, Kennedy said. 
Both bills were held for further study. Both bills also received testimony from Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University, who testified in support of the bill.
“I have no life,” Smith told the House committee of her kratom research. “All I do is study this”
Smith agreed with Kennedy on one count. “I don’t think we should be mixing psychoactive products,” she said.
But, she also told the House committee, “There are real humans who use this very responsibly and depend on it for their longterm recovery.”

The limits of willow bark
Smith encountered more resistance in the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services. Four of the committee’s members voted against the old version of the bill on the Senate floor last June. One was Sen. Pam Lauria, a Barrington Democrat and primary care nurse practitioner who grilled Smith about pharmacology — specifically, about kratom’s binding affinity, which describes how strongly substances interact with receptors in the body.  
“It does connect to the opioid receptor sites. Aside from how you theorize how it reacts there, it does,” Lauria said, adding that this needs to inform attempts about kratom’s interactions with other drugs. 
“It’s not an opioid. There are at least five mechanisms that are not opioid-related, that you can’t just put it in the opioid bucket,” Smith argued. “That’s not to say that the binding affinity isn’t there. It is. But that doesn’t mean it’s as a whole an opioid.”
But Smith conceded that people are going to mix drugs regardless: “If they’re going to do some polysubstance use, which is beyond our control, I would much prefer them to be informed consumers, as opposed to taking some random thing.”
Lauria had more questions for Jeffrey Bratberg, a clinical professor of pharmacy at the University of Rhode Island who spoke on behalf of the Rhode Island Pharmacists Association. Alluding to proponents’ arguments that kratom is natural, Lauria nudged Bratberg to list some other substances that come from plants. Cocaine and opium, Bratberg replied.
“We don’t use willow bark to treat pain. That’s what aspirin is derived from,” Bratberg noted. 
Existing medications like buprenorphine work as opioid replacements because they have been synthesized expressly for that purpose, Bratberg said. He concluded with an anecdote about artemisinin, an antimalarial drug that existed in raw plant form for thousands of years in Chinese medicine. It didn’t reach its true potential until being chemically extracted in 1972. 
“Purification matters,” Bratberg said.

Many of his columns, highlighting a wide variety of concerns in his home community, included the refrain, “Is anybody there? Does anybody care?”
That plaintive question came to mind Tuesday as I listened to Iowa senators debate what is likely to be the lone bill this year addressing nursing home regulation. Actually, “debate” is the wrong word. What happened was a refusal to debate.
Democrats introduced 14 bills this session in an effort to address critical failures in Iowa’s nursing homes. Failures like the one Iowa Capital Dispatch’s Clark Kauffman reported  Tuesday that led to what must have been agonizing pain, weeks of suffering and the eventual death of a resident at Sanford Senior Care in Sheldon.
State inspectors reported that in January, the resident had developed a “reddened area” on his coccyx, or tailbone. Nursing home staff did nothing, state records show – no assessment, treatment or physician contact – even after the sore developed into an open wound in February.
The man “looked absolutely awful,” an aide told inspectors later.  “There was bloody skin on both sides of the buttocks and continuing down it looked like hamburger,” the aide said, according to inspectors’ reports.
In March, the man was finally taken to the hospital with a Stage 4 wound that exposed muscle, bone or tendons. He died two days later of a staph infection.
Is anybody there? Does anybody care?
As anyone who reads Iowa Capital Dispatch regularly already knows, stories like this happen with shocking regularity.  Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner brought up several of them Tuesday on the Senate floor:

A resident at a care facility in Keota died from complications resulting from a fall after being found lying with bleeding head wound but not being transferred to a hospital until 15 days later.
In Wellman, where a nursing home worker found a woman lying on the floor with a “big goose egg” on the side of her head but was put to bed instead of being provided medical assistance. She was admitted to the hospital the next day and diagnosed with a brain bleed, fractured clavicle and urinary tract infection. She died a few weeks later of her injuries.
In Story City, a nursing home was cited for inadequate staffing twice in a month. The second time was after a resident known to need supervision while eating choked to death on a caramel brownie.

Not enough examples for you? Here are some others.

Nursing home sued after resident falls down concrete stairs in wheelchair
Resident chokes to death, home cited for rodents and staffing issues
Iowa care facilities recently cited for death, abuse and neglect
Nurse faces sentencing for wanton neglect in death of nursing home resident
Woman dies at Iowa nursing home recently acquired by private equity firm
Burns, ‘grapefruit-size’ wound and death trigger nursing home lawsuit
 Care facility fined $9,000 for infection, death

Is anybody there? Does anybody care?
The bills introduced by Sen. Claire Celsi, D-West Moines, would have required more frequent inspections of nursing homes and added 30 new inspectors to do the work. They would have increased fines for violations and allowed family members to install cameras in their loved ones’ rooms to help them monitor care. They would have prevented predatory private equity firms from buying out nursing home chains — a situation that has degraded care in Iowa facilities.
None of the bills received a hearing before a committee deadline, making all of them ineligible for debate in their original form.
That left Democrats to try to attach some of the proposals as amendments to the only nursing home bill the majority party has been inclined to consider. That bill would give nursing home operators an extra opportunity to avoid being cited for critical violations.
All of the amendments that would have expanded oversight were ruled out of order on Tuesday. The majority party senators could have chosen to debate these measures anyway. They did not.
Is anybody there? Does anybody care?
One might wonder what other issues the GOP majority in the Legislature finds more compelling than the safety of our elderly loved ones.
As an example, here’s what was happening in Des Moines while a man was dying in Sheldon:
On March 6, the same day the patient in Sheldon was admitted to the hospital after weeks of neglect, the Republican majority in the Statehouse was pushing its priority bills through the first of two deadlines for committee action. What were those priorities?
Well, they kept alive a bill to make sure 18-year-olds can carry a firearm, because that will make the rest of us feel a whole lot safer. They pushed forward election changes that will mean any Iowan with a foreign-sounding name or brown skin will want to carry their passport if they want to vote without a whole lot of red tape. And they backed the badge by passing a law to allow Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird to target a county sheriff who said in social media that he wasn’t going to comply with detainer requests from federal immigration enforcement unless they were “valid” ones.
What they weren’t doing is lifting a finger to make our elderly loved ones safer in long-term care.
There’s at least one more opportunity this year for lawmakers to do something meaningful for nursing home residents. They could include some of the Democrats’ oversight proposals and funding for additional inspectors in the state budget.
Sen. Kara Warme, R-Ames, said Tuesday she was “sympathetic” to the concerns raised by the Democrats – as she was seeking to have their proposals dismissed.
“I’m sympathetic to the concerns raised by the senators, and I believe resident safety is a top priority in our nursing facilities,” she said.
Iowa has a lot of excellent nursing homes with caring staff, to be sure. But turning a blind eye to the abuse, neglect and literal torture that residents are enduring in some facilities is the opposite of sympathy.

In Iowa, court-ordered awards for noneconomic losses stemming from medical malpractice are capped at $250,000, except in cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body.”
Attorneys for the CHI and Mercy One hospital are arguing the cap on damages still applies in cases where the “loss” is that of a fetus or unborn child.

CHI’s status as a nonprofit, tax-exempt entity is based on its stated mission of providing health services “in the spirit of the gospel.” The ethics guidelines it approved in 2018 state that the corporation is committed to “respect the sacredness of every human life from the moment of conception until death.”
The lawsuit in which CHI is currently embroiled involves the treatment provided to Miranda Anderson of Poweshiek County. Anderson was 34 weeks pregnant when, on April 13, 2021, she arrived at Pella Regional Health Center for evaluation due to elevated blood pressure, headaches and edema.
Citing concerns that she was experiencing preeclampsia — a condition that can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby and may require early delivery — Anderson was transferred to MercyOne’s Obstetrics Emergency Unit via ambulance.
According to the lawsuit later filed by Anderson and her husband, Landen, Miranda Anderson was discharged after two days of monitoring and testing. After further evaluations over the course of the next several days, she was again discharged to her home — until, during an April 21 evaluation, her doctor was unable to detect any fetal heartbeat. The next day, she underwent a cesarean delivery of a nonviable baby girl, Eloise.
The Andersons’ lawsuit seeks damages for negligence, alleging CHI, MercyOne and its physicians failed to recommend early delivery of the baby while it was still viable and Anderson showed evidence of preeclampsia. The defendants have denied any wrongdoing.
Citing the state’s $250,000 cap on noneconomic damages in malpractice cases — a cap that was approved by state legislators in 2017 — CHI and MercyOne are arguing that while the cap on damages includes an exemption for cases that entail the “loss or impairment of mind or body,” that exemption should not apply to a case where a fetus or unborn child is lost.
They argue the Iowa Legislature did not intend for the loss of a baby prior to delivery to be included within the exemption and that Anderson’s lawyers are attempting “to put words in the Legislature’s mouth … There is no case law, and plaintiffs cite to none, finding ‘loss of pregnancy’ is a ‘loss or impairment of a bodily function.’”
As evidence of this, they cite the fact that in 2023 — two years after the Anderson pregnancy — state lawmakers explicitly added “loss of pregnancy” to the exemption on the cap for damages. Attorneys for Anderson argue the 2023 change was enacted merely to clarify the scope of the 2017 statute, not to expand the exemption on the caps for damages.
In recent court filings, attorneys for CHI and MercyOne argue that “finding an unborn child to be a ‘person’ would lead to serious implications in other areas of the law.” They also argue the Andersons’ unborn child should not be considered a “patient” for purposes of calculating damages.
“There is no statute or binding case law finding an unborn child to be a ‘patient’ under the law,” attorneys for the hospital have told the court, citing an Iowa Supreme Court ruling in a 1971 case that held “there can be no recovery (of damages) on behalf of, or for, a nonexistent person.”
As part of their case, attorneys for CHI and MercyOne also argue that the Iowa Legislature’s decision to cap noneconomic damages in medical malpractice cases was motivated by a desire to “reduce the size of medical malpractice verdicts to increase the affordability and availability of medical care and protect the public treasury.”
The hospital is now seeking a court order affirming the Andersons’ recovery for any noneconomic damages that might be awarded shall be limited to $250,000 under the cap approved by legislators in 2017. A hearing on that issue is expected later this month, while the case itself is scheduled for trial on May 12, 2025.
Catholic Health Initiatives-Iowa and MercyOne did not respond to calls and emails from the Iowa Capital Dispatch on Wednesday.

(Adam Gray/Getty Images)An immigration judge plans to decide as soon as this week whether or not Mahmoud Khalil – a former Columbia University student targeted by the Trump administration over his involvement in student-led protests  – can be deported or not.
After a brief hearing on Tuesday at the LaSalle Immigration Court in Jena, Judge Jamee Comans ordered attorneys for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to hand over evidence against Khalil, by the end of the business day on Wednesday. Comans said she will rule on, whether Khalil, a Syrian-born Palestinian who is a legal permanent U.S. resident, can be removed from the country at a hearing later this week.
Comans indicated that she intends to make a decision as quickly as possible since Khalil has already been held in immigration detention since early March.
“Your client’s detained and if he’s not removable I don’t want him detained,” Comans said. “I’m not gonna keep him detained while attorneys argue about his removability.”
Khalil’s case, which is playing out in both LaSalle Parish and New Jersey, has drawn international attention since Khalil was picked up in his New York City apartment last month by federal immigration agents as part of a Trump administration crackdown.
Khalil is being targeted because he worked with protesters during large protests against Israel’s war in Gaza on Columbia’s campus last year. Top officials in the Trump administration, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, have accused Khalil of supporting Hamas, the group that controls the Gaza Strip, which the U.S. government considers a terrorist organization.
But civil rights advocates say the administration is focusing on Khalil — as well as other student protesters swept up in recent ICE actions —  over his political speech, violating his First Amendment rights under the U.S. Constitution.
Khalil — who has been held in the Central Louisiana ICE Processing Center for about a month — appeared before an unusually crowded courtroom for the Tuesday hearing. Khalil sat alone at a desk facing the judge and a screen where his lawyers and his wife appeared. Khalil fingered Muslim prayer beads in his right hand as his lead attorney, Mark Van Der Hout, discussed with the judge how to proceed on the case.

Van Der Hout pushed for more time to prepare for the case against Kahlil’s deportation because his team had neither  seen nor been able to respond to evidence from DHS attorneys. Comans repeatedly said a full hearing with the evidence would allow her to rule on whether Khalil should be deported or not.
She said if she orders Khalil removed, then his attorneys will have an opportunity to argue for some form of relief from deportation.
The matter before Comans is separate from a legal case his attorneys are pursuing in a New Jersey federal court. Attorneys in the New Jersey case are arguing that Khalil’s arrest and continued detention in federal immigration custody are unlawful. The Louisiana case is based on the Trump administration’s claims that Khalil should be deported.
On Tuesday, however, Comans said she would delay ruling until after DHS provides evidence backing up the Trump administration’s charges against Khalil.
In government filings, Khalil is charged with posing a serious threat to U.S. foreign policy. DHS, which is prosecuting the case, also claims Khalil intentionally withheld information about his former employment and about his membership in a Pro-Palestine university organization when he applied for his green card. He is being charged under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which allows the Secretary of State to remove any non-citizen deemed to be a threat to U.S. foreign policy.
The government has until 5 p.m. Wednesday Central time to submit that evidence. Comans has set another hearing for Friday, during which she will rule.

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A bill that would permit motorcyclists to stand up while driving their vehicle is nearly headed to the governor’s desk.
“Standing up on the foot pegs just gives you so much more control when a bump is coming up. Your legs act like shock absorbers,” said Sen. Mark Maynard, R-Wayne, who voted in support of the measure. “This is just heinous that if somebody does this, they would be ticketed.”
The Senate signed off on the measure, House Bill 2752, Monday evening with a vote of 27-6. The bill passed out of the House of Delegates March 19, spurring a viral video that showed Del. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, yelling, “Vroom! Vroom! West Virginia,” before criticizing the Republican-backed bill, saying it was unnecessary and did nothing to help residents of the state.

Senate Minority Leader Mike Woelfel also questioned why lawmakers were spending time on the legislation. He called it the “Organ Donor Act of 2025.”
“I’ve put up with a lot of shenanigans this session,” said Woelfel, D-Cabell. “But why are we taking up the Senate’s time with a bill to allow people legally to stand up on their motorcycles while the motorcycle is moving forward?”
“Of all the issues we have in our state, we’re going to make legislation to let people be Evel Knievel? I’d like to have a no vote to send a message down the hallway,” he continued.
Sen. Patricia Rucker, R-Jefferson, said she had been told that the bill, which originated in the House, was needed. 
“Right now if you stand up – you still have your feet on the foot pegs — it is a crime. They needed this legislation to allow them to stand up.”
Motorcyclists are already instructed to stand up in certain situations as part of their required instruction to obtain a motorcycle license, according to bill sponsor Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam. The bill also includes mopeds and motor-driven cycles. 
The House will have to concur with the Senate’s vote before the legislation heads to Gov. 
Patrick Morrisey’s desk for consideration.

The Nasdaq index saw the biggest single-day hike in five years as of Wednesday afternoon, according to financial media.The pause will not extend to China, which he announced will see a further hike to 125% on imports to the U.S. “effective immediately,” he said.“At some point, hopefully in the near future, China will realize that the days of ripping off the U.S.A., and other Countries, is no longer sustainable or acceptable,” Trump posted on Truth Social just after 1 p.m. Eastern.The president said more than 75 countries have reached out to negotiate, and that because “these Countries have not, at my strong suggestion, retaliated in any way, shape, or form against the United States” he is dropping their tariff rates to a universal 10%.Several rounds of tariffs the president enacted in March will remain in place, including 25% import taxes on foreign steel, aluminum and cars — charges which sparked the European Union to approve retaliatory tariffs Wednesday.Canada and Mexico, which both face up to 25% tariffs on a sizable chunk of products, will continue to see the levies but will not face an additional 10% stacked on top.Trump’s 25% tax on imports from any country that buys oil from Venezuela also remains unchanged.Americans ‘yippy’The president told the press outside the White House Wednesday afternoon that he saw people getting “queasy” and “yippy” about the market turmoil.“You have to have flexibility,” Trump said about his decision to pause the levies.The tariffs, which the administration maintains are “reciprocal,” though under a formula disputed by economists, went into effect just after midnight Wednesday.When asked by reporters if he’ll consider exempting any large companies that lost big in the market crash from paying the baseline 10% import tax, Trump said he’ll rely on his “instinct” to make the decision.The announcement came just hours after the president posted on social media “BE COOL!” and “THIS IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY!!! DJT.”Trump’s sudden pause also came just after U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer defended the steep tariffs to nervous lawmakers for the second day in a row.Administration officials quickly claimed the sudden pause was part of Trump’s strategy all along — despite several saying over the last few days that the tariffs were here to stay and that Americans needed to have patience as the market crashed. More than half of Americans are invested in the stock market.White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller characterized Trump’s about-face on tariffs as “the greatest economic master strategy from an American President in history,” in a post on X Wednesday afternoon.A rollercoaster few daysTrump’s tariff plan sent shock waves through the economy after he unveiled import taxes on trading partners and allies, including 46% for Vietnam, a major tech exporter to the U.S.The administration calculated the steep tariff rates based on each country’s trade deficit with the U.S.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told reporters outside the White House Wednesday that the tariffs were “a successful negotiating strategy.”“As I told everyone a week ago in this very spot: Do not retaliate, and you will be rewarded,” Bessent said.The administration met with Vietnamese officials Wednesday, according to Bessent, and meetings with Japan, South Korea and India are expected shortly, though he didn’t provide details.When asked by reporters if Trump’s tariff policy was mainly now focused on China, Bessent said “it’s about bad actors” but added that China “is the biggest source of the U.S. trade problems.”The trade war — a term Bessent rejected — between the U.S. and China expanded rapidly overnight Wednesday when Chinese officials raised levies on U.S. goods to 84%.“The US's practice of escalating tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake, which seriously infringes on China's legitimate rights and interests and seriously damages the rules-based multilateral trading system,” according to a translation of a statement Wednesday from the country’s State Council Tariff Commission.Pressure from lawmakersA Trump campaign account posted on X a screenshot of the president’s morning message urging people to buy stocks and asked “Did the Panicans listen to @POTUS’s advice this morning?”“Panicans” is a term Trump used recently to mock lawmakers who openly criticized losses to retirement funds and questioned how the tariffs would affect small businesses in their districts.Republican Sens. Thom Tillis of North Carolina and James Lankford of Oklahoma grilled Greer Tuesday during a hearing before the Senate Committee on Finance.“Whose throat do I get to choke if this proves wrong?” Tillis asked.Greer faced questions Wednesday morning from the House Committee on Ways and Means, where Chair Jason Smith of Missouri cheered on Trump’s choice to unleash tariffs on almost every country at once.Rep. Richard Neal, the panel’s top Democrat, told Greer that his office has been “inundated” with calls from constituents worried about their 401k funds.“They don't know what to expect, trillions of dollars of market value being lost even as we meet,” the Massachusetts Democrat said at the morning hearing before Trump called off the tariffs.   Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff said Wednesday that he’s asking the White House if any insider trading occurred while Trump was “creating giant market fluctuations with his on-again, off-again tariffs.”“Who in the administration knew about Trump's latest tariff flip flop ahead of time? Did anyone buy or sell  stocks, and profit at the public’s expense?” Schiff wrote on X.Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington and Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa introduced a bipartisan bill to claw back Congressional power over trade decisions from the president, who currently has near-unilateral authority.GOP Rep.

Senate Bill 754, which is entitled “School Calendar Flexibility: A New Alternative” would offer school districts two options for commencing the new school year. One follows the current law, which requires a start date no earlier than the Monday closest to Aug. 26 and an end date no later than the Friday closest to June. The second and new option would allow schools to start on the Monday closest to Aug. 19, with the school year ending no later than the Friday before Memorial Day.
The bill is sponsored by Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), and Sens. Amy Galey (R-Alamance), and Michael Lee (R-New Hanover).
On Wednesday, Galey told members of the Senate Education/Higher Education Committee that the bill represents a compromise between the forces that helped enact the current law in 2004 (the state travel and tourism industry and a group of parents concerned about preserving summer vacations) and local education officials who would prefer even greater flexibility in setting the public school calendar. She said that as many as a quarter of the state’s 116 districts are out of compliance with the current law.
Though the bill was approved on an almost unanimous voice vote and forwarded to the Judiciary Committee (among other things, the measure includes language that would allow businesses to sue local boards that set school calendars in violation of its specified dates), two Democratic senators voiced concern that the bill does not go far enough in addressing the needs and expertise of local school districts.
Both Sens. Gladys Robinson (D-Guilford) and Sophia Chitlik (D-Durham) argued that there are many situations in which local school districts would be better able to meet the needs of children in their communities by starting the school year earlier in August – a freedom, Robinson noted, that’s already given to charter schools.

Galey, with support from Sen. Bobby Hanig – a Republican who represents several coastal counties – responded that there are many families and businesses who are severely burdened by earlier start dates and that the bill was an attempt to find a middle ground.
In addition to the potential legal liability included in the bill for counties that fail to abide by the new start date, the measure also includes language – sought most aggressively by mountain counties that must cope with more snow days in the winter – that would permit the school year closing date to be extended in situations where districts experience closures due to extreme weather.

(Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.

“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.

“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.

Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.











It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician



From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.

In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.

Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

(Photo: John Partipilo)Straight off a prison stint cut short by a presidential pardon, former Tennessee Sen. Brian Kelsey is maneuvering for legislation to pay his legal expenses.
The ex-Germantown Republican who served two weeks in federal prison for directing an illicit campaign finance scheme is lobbying lawmakers to pass legislation that would enable him to use his state campaign account to pay legal fees after three years of court battles.
Republican Sen. Richard Briggs of Knoxville confirmed Wednesday that Kelsey called him twice to ask him to put an amendment on a campaign finance bill he’s sponsoring this session. Republican Rep. Tim Hicks of Washington County is sponsoring the House version of the bill, and Democratic Rep. Caleb Hemmer of Nashville is a co-sponsor.
Briggs wasn’t certain what sort of amendment Kelsey was seeking. Kelsey also contacted Hicks, according to Briggs.
But Bill Young, executive director of the Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance, said the former senator wants to be able to use state campaign funds to pay for legal expenses. 
Former Tennessee Sen. Brian Kelsey gains Trump pardon two weeks after heading to prison

Kelsey hired at least six attorneys after being indicted for violating federal campaign finance law by funneling more than $80,000 through two political action committees to the American Conservative Union, which paid for ads in his failed 2016 congressional race. It is illegal to use state campaign money to pay for a federal campaign because the funds are raised under different rules.
The Bureau of Ethics and Campaign Finance turned down Kelsey’s previous request to use funds left in his state account to pay legal fees. Kelsey had $197,519 in his state account before transferring it to his Red State Political Action Committee in June 2023. The PAC has more than $180,300, according to the latest filing with the state.
Briggs’ bill is stuck in the Senate finance committee because of a provision that would take part of the professional privilege tax paid by lobbyists to hire auditors and pay for a new campaign finance reporting system for the Registry of Election Finance and Ethics Commission.
Kelsey served two weeks in a federal prison in Kentucky this year before receiving a pardon from President Donald Trump. The former senator stepped down from his Senate post four years ago after being indicted. He pleaded guilty to federal campaign finance charges but then rescinded his plea, claiming he didn’t violate any laws.
Kelsey hired a handful of attorneys after releasing his first legal counsel team. He also claimed his decision to plead guilty was clouded by the birth of twin sons and the illness of his father, who later died. Kelsey also said he didn’t understand the criminal law system even though he was an attorney and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Christian Chenet, 28, was being held in the Cole County Jail. Bond will be set later today, Cole County Prosecuting Attorney Locke Thompson said in an email and Chenet will have his first court appearance Friday if he does not post bond.
The first degree harassment charge is a felony and the assault charge is a misdemeanor.
“Harassment and assault cases are kept on an automatic 24 hour hold, so he won’t have the ability to bond out until the judge sets a bond,” Thompson said.
The incident that led to charges began about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday when Chenet, who is a legislative assistant to state Rep. Kem Smith, a St. Louis Democrat, went to Izzy’s Burgers and Shakes to retrieve a purse left behind by state Rep. Kathy Steinhoff, a Columbia Democrat.
Smith declined to comment on Chenet’s arrest. Steinhoff also declined to comment. There is no attorney yet listed for Chenet on Casenet.
The incident became heated when the owner of Izzy’s, Taisir Yanis, refused to turn over the purse, looked inside to determine the owner and stated he could only release it to Steinhoff.
“This enraged the defendant and he became angry that the victim was in the purse,” according to the probable cause statement from Jefferson City Police officer Mitchell Rossian.
Chenet called Yanis a “f**king racist,” Rossian wrote, who told Chenet to leave and followed him outside.
Yanis told officers that he told Chenet not to come back to the business, Rossian wrote. Yanis told officers that is when Chenet told him, “stay here. I’m going to go get my gun.”
Chenet went to a vehicle and told responding officers that he had a gun in the car. A search found a Glock 9mm pistol.
Chenet told officers that Yanis pushed him and he ran to his vehicle. He said had called 911 and “mentioned shooting (Yanis).”
Under questioning, Rossian wrote, Chenet “still thought his actions were justified during the interview.”

Gretchen Whitmer called on lawmakers to work across the aisle to improve on the nation's shipbuilding, aviation and semiconductor chip manufacturing efforts during her Build, America, Build Address in Washington, D.C. on April 9, 2025 | ScreenshotStepping on stage in Washington, D.C. Wednesday morning, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer laid out her plan to rejuvenate American manufacturing, centering her strategy on shipbuilding, aviation and semiconductor chips. 
However, that vision faces a big hurdle, as President Donald Trump launches a global trade war, placing tariffs on allies and enemies alike and creating broad uncertainty for businesses in Michigan and across the nation. 
While Whitmer played to her bipartisan background, she didn’t mince words on the way Trump’s tariffs have impacted Michigan, noting that 20% of the state’s economy is tied to the auto industry, which depends on international trading partners. 
Michigan is also home to the busiest international border crossing in the U.S. With more than 10,000 trucks carrying parts and materials between Detroit and Windsor every weekday, the state is already seeing impacts from Trump’s tariffs. 
“Auto companies are stockpiling parts and laying off workers. Suppliers are facing higher costs and delaying expansions. Dealerships are forced to raise prices by up to $15,000 amid the slowing sales. And since every auto job supports three others in the community, the impact is being felt by all of us including small businesses across my state,” Whitmer said.

Looking beyond the auto industry, these tariffs represent a triple whammy for U.S. residents, Whitmer said, bringing higher costs on everyday goods, fewer jobs and increased uncertainty. 
While she agrees with Trump’s reasoning for the tariffs — supporting fair trade and increasing manufacturing in the U.S. — Whitmer called for a tariff carveout for autos and energy, and proposed working with U.S. allies to compete against its adversaries and leveraging increased investments into manufacturing. 
“I’m proud that the amount of money being spent to build factories in America has more than tripled over a decade. In Michigan, we’ve secured dozens of new facilities to build chips, batteries, cars and energy. Just this year, major companies have announced huge investments in America to build data centers and factories, and research facilities. Here’s my pitch: let’s keep going,” Whitmer said.

“Let’s make more ships, planes and semiconductor chips in America. Let’s cut red tape and unleash the extraordinary potential of American industry. Let’s give more hardworking people a fair shot at a decent life. And let’s usher in, as President Trump says, a ‘golden age’ of American manufacturing,” she said. 
She laid out the threats and challenges the nation faces as it works to support manufacturing in these industries, noting that each American shipyard is short more than 100,000 workers, while the aviation industry faces a similarly shrinking workforce. 

While the U.S. builds 0.1% of the world’s ships, China builds 53%, Whitmer said, with its largest state-owned ship company building more ships by tonnage last year than the U.S. has in the past 80 years. 
“Last September, the United States Navy set an ambitious goal of building hundreds more ships and submarines over the next few decades. If we don’t progress toward that goal, China’s naval fleet could be 50% larger than ours by 2030,” Whitmer warned, later calling for the expansion of job training programs for maritime manufacturing like Michigan’s M3 initiative. 
The Governor also noted that China’s largest passenger plane company, the Commercial Aircraft Corporation, is now making planes that are competing with the best selling American models on the market, and is on the verge of challenging the American-owned Boeing and European aircraft manufacturer Airbus, with the company receiving funding from the Chinese government.
“This should serve as a wake-up call to this country,” she said. 
“If we don’t hit the throttle while we lead in commercial and military aviation, China will pass us. That’s something we can’t afford. We must protect our lead, and Michigan is ready to do what it takes to win this. We can lean on our manufacturing expertise and skilled workforce to boost domestic aviation manufacturing,” Whitmer said, pointing to the precedent set in World War II when automakers shifted from producing cars and trucks to airplanes, tanks, guns and shells. 
While Michigan is doing its part, it can’t support the aerospace and defense industry on its own Whitmer said, calling on Washington to put together a national strategy and make bipartisan investments into America’s aviation industry and workforce.
“If we are proactive, we can create tens of thousands of good-paying jobs and protect our national security, and lower costs for travelers around the world and here at home.” Whitmer said. 
She also called for additional investments into semiconductor chip manufacturing, pointing to the role of the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act in boosting chip manufacturing, with the U.S. on track to make 20% of the world’s logic chips and 10% of D-RAM chips. 
“Both Democrats and Republicans agree that we must stay on the bleeding edge of technology. The President even mentioned chips in his speech to Congress and set up a new United States investment accelerator to oversee semiconductor projects. We have the momentum right now, and we cannot risk stepping back or faltering. We need to continue strong, bipartisan efforts at the state and national level to make more chips,” Whitmer said. 
While partisanship has infected every aspect of American lives, there’s more common ground than people think Whitmer said, pointing to the consensus between Democrats and Republicans to manufacture more goods in the U.S. 
“Building an industrial economy is no small task. It’s thousands of small tasks, and each of us—government, industry, entrepreneurs, workers—we’re part of the same pit crew…. If we do our jobs, we can get America back on the track better and faster than ever,” Whitmer said. 
Just as pit crews in the Detroit Grand Prix use teamwork, data driven strategies and the best products to get their car refueled, tuned up and heading toward the checkered flag as soon as possible, Whitmer said the U.S. should do the same in boosting its manufacturing economy.
“I know there’s been a lot of talk recently about government efficiency. But all the proposed solutions have been solely focused on firing people from the crew or stripping away critical parts. That’s no way to win a race. If we really want to win — and keep winning — we need to reinvest in our crew and build better parts. In our darkest hours, that’s exactly what we did,” Whitmer said, pointing to the manufacturing strategies of World War II and the coordination of Operation Warp Speed during the COVID-19 pandemic, which worked to speed up development of a vaccine for the disease. 
“I still remember the pride I felt when I watched the Pfizer vaccine get packed into trucks rolling out of Portage, Michigan. People stood outside on the road even though it was bitter cold, waving the Stars and Stripes, proud of what we had done. It was an extraordinary achievement that showed us what’s possible when we work together to streamline government and allow America to do what it does best: innovate and build,” Whitmer said. 
Following her speech, Whitmer sat down with journalist and Lift Our Voices Co-Founder Gretchen Carlson to talk more about tariffs, bipartisan collaboration and the state of the Democratic Party. 
When asked how she would have implemented tariffs differently, Whitmer said the current approach of treating trade partners in Mexico and Canada like adversaries would cost everyone, from lost auto jobs to increased prices on cars and blueberries from Mexico. 
“The big loser in this is American manufacturing and is the American consumer,” she said before underscoring the importance of enforcing the law against Chinese companies coming into the U.S.

She later explained that while she agrees there should be more manufacturing in the U.S. for both the economic benefits and to stem national security concerns, the supply chains that the U.S. has built with its North American neighbors rely on a seamless flow. 
“Perhaps we should be onshoring and the goal is great, but we need to be realistic. That doesn’t happen overnight. There are suppliers that are still trying to recover from inflation and COVID who are on the bubble and don’t have the resources to weather this up-and-down, uncertain time that, you know, where the rules keep changing,” Whitmer said. 
While Trump’s announcement of tariffs on Canada and Mexico won support from United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain, who said the levies could help bring auto jobs back to U.S. soil, Whitmer argued these efforts would harm everyone including autoworkers, pointing to the harm the auto industry has already seen from the tariffs. 
Carlson noted that Whitmer could have given this speech at home in Lansing, and asked whether her trip to D.C. was an indicator of presidential ambition. However, Whitmer dismissed the notion.
“No, no. This is my way of saying —this is similar to speeches that I’ve given in Michigan too, by the way — this is, I think, a blueprint for success. This is what we did in Michigan during World War II. This is what we are capable of as a nation,” Whitmer said. “We need leadership that stays focused on doing these things so Americans can get to work doing the big manufacturing that we are falling behind on globally, so that we can harness the strength of American companies, American institutions of education and the American workforce. That’s what this is all about.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-09-at-8.36.14 AM-1024x640.png,,,2025-04-09 13:19:56.431331

The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment’s warning comes after two previous measles cases in Pueblo and Denver. Unlike in those two cases, the Archuleta County resident, an adult whose vaccination status has not been confirmed, did not recently travel internationally.
“This case does not appear to be linked to the other cases reported in Colorado and the individual did not travel outside of Colorado, which leaves open the possibility of community transmission,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “We urge Coloradans to monitor for symptoms if they may have been exposed, and to make sure they are up to date on their (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccinations.”

Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine provide about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado has not had three measles cases confirmed in the same calendar year in at least 12 years, according to state data.
The infections come amid an alarming rise in measles outbreaks nationwide, including several clusters in west Texas and neighboring states that have caused at least two deaths of unvaccinated children. Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. While state law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, it allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
CDPHE officials say people may have been exposed to measles at the Wolf Creek Ski Area and Resort between March 28 and 30; the Pagosa Springs City Market on March 31; and the Pagosa Medical Group clinic at 27B Talisman Dr. on March 31 and April 2. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

Great Lakes Gun Rights and Michigan Open Carry, Inc. filed a lawsuit in April 2023 in an attempt to halt mandatory background checks for the purchase of firearms, as well as other procedures, that were proposed following the February 2023 mass shooting on Michigan State University’s campus that killed three students and critically injured five others.
The lawsuit was filed the same day Gov. Gretchen Whitmer signed into law legislation mandating background checks for all firearm purchases in the state and that all guns be stored safely in homes where minors could access the weapons. 
A Michigan Court of Claims judge determined in November of that year that while the state House had violated the open meetings law, by failing to “enact adequate rules regarding the right to address committees,” the injunction requested by the groups was not warranted and dismissed the suit.
In an opinion issued Tuesday, the appellate court upheld the Court of Claims decision, agreeing that the Legislature’s acceptance of both oral and written communications during the overall hearing process satisfied open meetings law requirements.

“The sole issue before us in this case is whether the trial court erred by deciding that ‘the Legislature intended to allow the public’s right to address public bodies under the OMA to be satisfied through oral and written submissions.’ We conclude that it did not,” said the opinion.
As for the OMA violations, which involved a failure by the House Judiciary Committee to have clear rules outlining who gets to testify in-person and for how long, the appeals panel noted the committee later adopted a rule in February 2024 that mirrored that of its Senate counterpart, bringing it into line with the OMA.
Following the opinion’s release, both Great Lakes Gun Rights and Michigan Open Carry, Inc. denounced the finding, saying it signaled a “chilling erosion of transparency and accountability in Lansing.”
Casey Armitage, president of Michigan Open Carry, Inc., said the ruling was a further attempt to “muzzle” gun owners.
“This isn’t just about meetings—it’s about our right to stand up and say ‘no’ to gun control in person, not just on some ignored scrap of paper. This decision emboldens every anti-gun politician to shut out the people they’re supposed to serve,” said Armitage in a statement posted to social media.
Both groups vowed to explore all avenues, including “legal challenges, legislative pressure, and grassroots mobilization” to reverse the decision, according to the statement.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1135138396-scaled-1-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 13:19:56.431331

Bring penguins.
That’s what the staff at the Florida Aquarium in Tampa did Wednesday, bringing four penguins to the Capitol for lawmakers, staff, and reporters to get a glimpse of.
It brought attention to the budget appropriation made by Tampa Republican Rep. Karen Gonzalez Pittman in the House and Tampa Bay-area Republican Danny Burgess in the Senate for $1 million for the aquarium’s storm and flood protection project, which is designed to provide total perimeter protection for  animal habitats and life-support systems against wind and flood damage.
“Because we are building and investing in this large outdoor habitat, for not only our African penguins but we’ll have California sea lions out there as well, with all the recent impacts from the hurricanes that we had this past fall, we’re really looking forward to being able to have a more resilient outdoor space, so we’re seeking funding for a seawall that will protect us during those times,” said Emily Vazir, development coordinator at the Florida Aquarium.
That project is just part of the $45 million expansion that the aquarium has been working on since 2023 and expects to complete in 2026.
Archibold, or Archi, was on display at Senate Majority Leader Jim Byrd’s office on Wednesday. At 4 years old, Archi is the youngest penguin in the aquarium colony, according to Vazir. There are nine at the facility. Three other penguins accompanied Archi in making the visit to the Capitol.

HB 437, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, would require the Alabama Department of Conservation and Natural Resources to develop a system to send wireless alerts about unprovoked shark attacks or after a “credible report” of shark activity that may pose an “imminent threat” to beachgoers in Mobile or Baldwin counties.
“It will set up a system, like an Amber Alert, that will be geofenced, when there has been a previous shark attack, an unprovoked shark attack near a coastline,” Faulkner told members of the House Public Safety and Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday.  said to members of the committee. “And it will allow professionals, emergency management, people who are in the business of doing this, for them to be able to send a notice. It puts a tool in the toolbox.”
The bill is named for Lulu Gribbin, a 16-year-old from Mountain Brook who was attacked by a shark last year while swimming off a beach in Florida, losing an arm and a leg in the process.
Gribbin underwent months of intensive care and rehabilitation and founded a foundation called “Lulu Strong” to advocate for prosthetic technologies for people with amputated limbs.
“Since then, I have had so many opportunities and my life has changed completely,” Gribbin told the committee on Wednesday. “With this bill in place, we can prevent further accidents in the future, and I am so excited to be able to pass it.”
The system will be activated in case of a triggering event, such as “a confirmed report of an unprovoked shark attacking an individual.” It may also be activated if the Conservation receives a report of the presence of a shark in the area posing a danger to potential swimmers nearby. The Legislative Services Agency did not have an estimate of the cost of the system.
Shark attacks are generally rare. According to the Georgia Aquarium, there are only 60 to 65 unprovoked shark attacks around the world each year, with only about six of those being fatal. By comparison, the National Safety Council said 1,039 Alabamians died in automobile accidents in 2022. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 1,278 Alabamians died by firearms in 2022.
Faulkner’s bill follows a congressional bill filed by U.S. Sen. Katie Britt of Alabama in honor of Gribbin that would alert people at a beach to their phones if a shark attack had taken place recently.
The bill moves to the House of Representatives for further consideration.

(Photo:  Jerod MacDonald-Evoy / Arizona Mirror)The leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix, Arizona Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights, and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.

The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.

Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

HB 234, sponsored by Rep. Alan Baker, R-Brewton, passed the House of Representatives 58-30 in March. The legislation would require public school employees who are around students to be equipped with an emergency button. It also mandates regular training for employees with the technology.
“We’ve heard the expressions like every second counts time equals lives. These are expressions that are often heard in crisis and emergency incidents,” Baker said. “With this mobile rapid response technology in place, if this bill passes, then teachers, administrators, office, staff, custodians, lunchroom workers, maintenance and other education employees become the eyes and ears, internally and externally across the school campus to activate an alert that immediately notifies school officials and law enforcement of the exact location for the most rapid response to the incident.”

An amendment that would extend the implementation time of the technology on the condition of additional funding specifically for school public safety starting in 2030 was adopted unanimously by the Senate Education Policy Committee.  
“That actually sort of extends it possibly even beyond that, if there is not annual dedicated funding for school safety,” Baker said.
Baker said the technology would improve response times with first responders receiving the exact location of the emergency. Baker said on the House floor in March that an emergency is not limited to a shooting threat, but could also be used for a medical emergency.
Most of the concerns toward the bill in the House revolved around whether schools had the resources to install and maintain the technology. 
Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, said he is concerned about the legislation not addressing the root of the issue of safety in schools. He said there is a lack of discipline in the home that leads to safety issues at schools.
“We continually address these issues of school safety, and I’m 100% for that, but my concern is that we never seem to really address the reasons that we have these issues,” Stutts said. 
The bill will now be considered by the full Senate.

Daniel Grossberg has gained a second primary challenger for his seat in the state legislature. 
Cassie Lyles, a high school teacher in Jefferson County Public Schools, announced her candidacy for the 30th House District Tuesday. The primary will be held in May 2026. 
“For years, I’ve been in the classroom, on the front lines, shaping young minds and ensuring that every student has the opportunity to succeed,” Lyles said in a press release. “Now, it’s time to take that passion to a broader level. Teachers see first-hand how the decisions made in Frankfort affect Kentucky’s kids and families. Everything affecting our communities walks into our classrooms as well.  We need more educators in office, and I am ready to step up.”
Lyles kicked off her campaign during a Tuesday event at the Jefferson County Teachers Association office where she was introduced by Kentucky AFL-CIO President Dustin Reinstedler and former U.S. Rep. John Yarmuth. Lyles aims to make “future of public education, workers rights, the needs of her community” a focus of her campaign. 
In December, Max Morley, who has worked as a teacher in Jefferson County Public Schools and is a Democratic political adviser, announced his candidacy for the primary election. 
Grossberg faced no opponent in the 2024 general election after narrowly winning his primary. However, prominent Kentucky Democrats, including Gov. Andy Beshear and House Democratic Caucus members, said Grossberg should resign following Lexington Herald-Leader investigations that detailed allegations of inappropriate behavior from Grossberg, including receiving a lifetime ban from a Louisville strip club after inappropriately touching a dancer and instances of alleged sexual harassment toward women in Kentucky politics. The Kentucky Legislative Ethics Commission has opened investigations into allegations against Grossberg.
Grossberg has repeatedly denied the allegations and vowed to remain in office.

Laura Kelly's vetoes, but also needs to complete work on annual public school funding legislation.","A deputy commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education informed members of the Kansas State Board of Education the 2025 Legislature has yet to approve collection of an estimated $875 million in property taxes to fund public education statewide in 2025-2026. (Kansas Reflector screen capture of Board of Education livestream)TOPEKA — The Republican-controlled Kansas Legislature returns to work Thursday after neglecting to perform during the regular part of the 2025 session an annual obligation to affirm collection of $875 million in property taxes to finance public schools statewide.
It’s assumed by education administrators and advocates the wrap-up portion of the legislative session — typically reserved for attempts to override vetoes by Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly — would allow time for passage of a bill clarifying the 2025-2026 funding picture for school districts serving more than 450,000 students throughout the state.
“Unless they fix that this week, that’s an $875 million hole in next year’s budget,” said Frank Harwood, deputy commissioner of fiscal and administrative services at the Kansas State Department of Education.
He said the Legislature could take advantage of the brief end-of-session window to address a bill triggering collection of 20 mills in property tax for public schools. State law requires every school district levy a 20-mill tax on property in their district to help finance public education. This money didn’t stay in the taxing district, but was sent to the state to create the pool of money to fund all districts.
“If this doesn’t get dealt with, we’re going to be coming back for a special session,” said Sen. Cindy Holscher, a Democrat from Overland Park.
Without the property tax levy, the Legislature would have to replace the revenue with an appropriation from the general treasury or reduce funding to public school districts.
The Legislature risked running afoul of Kansas Supreme Court decisions in the Gannon case that resulted from a finding the Legislature failed to abide by the Kansas Constitution in terms of funding a suitable education for children.
Meanwhile, a second education budget issue emerged regarding the Legislature’s decision to designate $1.25 million for public schools and $250,000 to private schools for CPR training and to acquire defibrillator or AED equipment.
The appropriation, inspired by survival of an Emporia teenager who suffered cardiac arrest, would be drawn from an anticipated increase in base-aid school funding. This category of K-12 funding was adjusted annually based on changes in the Midwest version of the consumer price index for urban consumers or CPI-U.
Leah Fliter, assistant executive director of the Kansas Association of School Boards, said CPI-U funding was to be directed to public education, but the state budget presented to the governor directed a portion to private schools.
Fliter said the school board association wasn’t opposed to state spending for training or equipment to address cardiac emergencies in private schools, but suggested lawmakers ought to select a funding source other than CPI-U aid for public education.
“We are very concerned about that taking of CPI funding for AEDs,” she said.
Harwood, the deputy commissioner at the state Department of Education, said questions had been raised about constitutionality of the $250,000 appropriation to private schools.
“Because most of the private schools are parochial, it may actually be a violation of the Constitution because state aid can’t go to parochial schools,” Harwood said.
The Legislature scheduled work sessions Thursday and Friday in anticipation the governor would issue vetoes. As of Tuesday, Kelly had vetoed 10 bills approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature. The governor has been working through the state budget bill and could make line-item vetoes.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Kansas-board-of-education-2-1024x567.png,,,2025-04-09 12:23:50.902520

Michelle Lujan Grisham's decision to deploy the National Guard to Albuquerque to help with public safety issues,"Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham discussed her executive order deploying the National Guard to Albuquerque with reporters at an April 8, 2025 event in Santa Fe to pick up trash on Cerrillos Road (Julia Goldberg/Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham’s executive order deploying the National Guard to help the Albuquerque Police Department amounts to “a show of force, not a show of solutions,” ACLU New Mexico policy advocate Daniel Williams said in a statement released by the organization on Tuesday afternoon.
The governor had announced the deployment earlier that day in a news release that cited an emergency request from the Albuquerque Police noting the fentanyl epidemic and rising violent juvenile crime “as critical issues requiring immediate intervention.” According to the governor’s office, between 60 and 70 National Guard personnel will be deployed to Albuquerque starting in mid-May, following training that has already begun under the supervision of the New Mexico Department of Homeland Security, Department of Public Safety, State Police and APD. The governor’s office said Central Avenue and other specific corridors would receive particular focus.
In remarks to reporters Tuesday afternoon in the midst of a clean-up event on Cerrillos Road in Santa Fe, the governor said those areas were chosen “based on call volumes, arrests and risk.” She noted that any Albuquerque who drives through downtown has seen the crime in the area.
“I see drug dealing, drug use, prostitution,” she said. “I worry about human trafficking…if we don’t…do appropriate, fair interventions, you get to a place where you can’t get neighborhoods safe for the people who live there. It’s not fair to the people who are driving to and from work, and the people who live there. Frankly, it’s not fair to the whole city.”
The governor emphasized that the National Guard would not be engaged in direct policing but, rather, in support roles, such as transportation to hospitals, additional security and medical assistance.
Only a “very select number of National Guard” would be in a position to do direct policing, she said. “It’s the military police,” Lujan Grisham said. “They don’t have a relationship with anyone in those communities…so that can create more risk, not less.” The “best thing they can do,” she added, “is to allow the folks who know that area, who can get that work done in a much more coordinated, direct environment, to let them to do their job quickly.”
In its news release, ACLU-NM expressed concern that “militarizing civilian law enforcement will lead to civil rights violations and further criminalize homelessness rather than address the root causes of public safety issues.”
Williams’ statement, moreover, said Lujan Grisham’s “past policy proposals too often have centered on efforts to criminalize and institutionalize unhoused New Mexicans, without a commensurate emphasis on solving the root causes of crime. New Mexicans should be confident that their governor is truly working to keep them safe, not doubling down on failed strategies that will fuel mass incarceration and multiply the harms our communities already endure. In a state so heavily impacted by police violence, the answer to safety cannot and will not be found in increased police presence, especially not through collaboration with the military.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1180-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-09 11:12:17.702207

“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones.

(Courtesy of Glenda Nixon)Anti-Trump protests are nothing new. They’ve been occurring with regularity in America, and I’ve been attending them here in Rapid City, ever since Donald Trump’s first election in 2016. So I was expecting all of the usual suspects, and about the usual response when I went to the Hands Off protest last weekend here that was part of a larger national movement. A protest in Rapid City, or anywhere in South Dakota, usually means a gathering of not more than a couple hundred people whose actions go largely unnoticed by the rest of the state.
This one felt, if not exactly new, at least different.
For starters, there was not one, but two, rallies in Rapid City on Saturday. Both of them were larger and more enthusiastic than past rallies have been. There were better signs, more encouraging honking from passing motorists and, most significantly, what appeared to be a wider, broader base of angry voters. Most of the vitriol was reserved for President Trump, of course, but there was plenty left over for South Dakota’s congressional delegation.
Crowd size is difficult to estimate, but I’m guessing perhaps a thousand people stretched out along Omaha Street at Rapid City’s Founders Park on Saturday morning for the Hands Off event. At noon, a second rally had begun a bit farther east in front of City Hall, where a similar sized crowd — no doubt many of the same protesters — continued their anti-Trump messaging at a 50501 event. Protests occurred across the state, in cities including Pierre, Brookings, Aberdeen, Mitchell and Watertown. In Sioux Falls, thousands of people showed up, to the surprise of protesters and observers alike.
Thousands gather in Sioux Falls to protest Trump’s actions

In Rapid City, there were plenty of signs telling President Trump and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency to keep their “Hands Off!” of schools, libraries, feeding programs, Medicare, Social Security, voting rights, free speech, health care, transgender kids, democracy, federal employees, gay rights, the courts, reproductive rights … and on, and on, and on. The Hands Off list was as long as the flurry of executive orders issued by Trump in the first few weeks of his presidency. I especially liked the “You Can’t Spell Felon without Elon” sign and the many inventive reinterpretations of the MAGA acronym, such as “Morons Are Governing America.” One of my personal favorites was a sign carried not by a person at all, but affixed to a fluffy little dog that read, “Good DOG; Bad DOGE.”
There were also plenty of signs letting South Dakota’s congressional delegation know what protesters think of them. What they think is that Sen. John Thune, Sen. Mike Rounds and Rep. Dusty Johnson are complicit in Trump’s blatant disregard for federal workers, his dismantling of federal agencies and his abandonment of democratic norms.
Photos of the three incumbent Republicans appeared on numerous signs that were critical of Congress for conceding its power to Trump’s executive branch, with slogans like: “Anybody Here Seen Our Old Friends?” “Can You Tell Me Where They’ve Gone?” “Do Your Jobs!” “Support Democracy, not Fascism.” “History Will Remember Your Complicity.”
While the three men could not escape the creativity of the rally signs, it remains to be seen if they will manage to escape angry voters at the ballot box. South Dakota is a very red state, after all, and they have all cruised to easy election victories in the past. But we are also a state with a rich history of showing longtime incumbent politicians the door once voters decide an elected official has become more responsive to the powers-that-be in Washington, D.C., than to South Dakotans. Even many Trump voters may eventually decide they’ve had their fill of tariff trade wars and stock market losses. Some of them, likely some of the federal employees carrying AFGE signs supporting the American Federation of Government Employees last Saturday, already have. Thune, Rounds and Johnson would be wise to consider them.
Back on Jan. 25, I went to a March for Democracy in Rapid City, just days after President Trump’s second inauguration. It all felt futile that day, and I bemoaned to two friends in the crowd, “What is it we’re doing here … again?” Perhaps the small crowd and the lack of enthusiasm we felt that day could be blamed on the freezing temperatures and the bitter cold wind. But it was clear that we were also feeling the dispiriting chill of another four years of a Trump presidency and what it meant for our country.
Fast forward two months, and the protest climate in Rapid City felt different to me. Maybe that was nothing more than last weekend’s sunshine and the spring-like temperatures, but I suspect there is something else heating up voters all across America.

Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.

“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.
The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.

Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.

Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.
Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.
And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

The Judiciary 1 Committee voted in favor of House Bill 549 after presentations from sponsor Rep. Brenden Jones (R-Columbus), the second-ranked Republican in the House, and Kirk O’Steen, the director of government affairs for the state auditor’s office. It will now head to the Committee on State and Local Government for further debate.
The bill expands the auditor’s investigative powers to encompass any entity receiving state or federal funds, requiring the office to pursue any reports of “improper governmental activities” among those agencies, their employees, and any individuals who receive public funds — including fraud, misappropriation and waste of public resources, and violation of state or federal laws.
If enacted, the auditor’s office would also receive “continuous and unrestricted access” to any databases, datasets, and digital records deemed necessary for investigations, allowing the auditor to seek a court order if access is not provided. The bill also exempts the state auditor’s office from a number of statutory requirements, including legislation around the use of information technology and the North Carolina State Human Resources Act — a level of independence Jones said is similar to that of the General Assembly and the state courts.
Jones said in introducing the bill that it was largely directed by State Auditor Dave Boliek’s staff, telling lawmakers, “it’s not my dog, I’m just walking it.” He said the additional powers were crucial for improving government accountability and transparency.
“It strengthens the auditor’s independence, ensuring the office can do its job without red tape or delays or interference from other branches of government,” Jones said. “It allows the auditor to better follow the money by clarifying the ability to investigate individuals and organizations that receive state or federal funds.”

The bill comes amid a substantial increase in the state auditor’s authority after the office flipped from Democratic to Republican in the 2024 election, the only Council of State office to do so. The House committee action came on the same day the state Senate approved a measure to establish a new team in the same office to scrutinize state spending and job openings. Lawmakers also gave Boliek’s office administrative authority over the State Board of Elections and the ability to make appointments to it just weeks after the election, though the law is currently being challenged in state court.
Rep. Brandon Lofton (D-Mecklenburg) raised concerns about the breadth of the new definition for “state agencies,” calling the bill’s proposal to open up any entity that receives state funds to the auditor’s full scrutiny “broad and onerous.”
“Any church that receives any grants, any factory that receives state incentives, any hospital or farm that receives subsidies, any private school that receives voucher money — all these entities, no matter how much money they receive, are now subject to these requirements,” Lofton said. “That means that any of these entities would have to subject themselves to the auditor having continuous and unrestricted view of databases, data sets and digital records.”
O’Steen, the auditor’s office staffer, said the bill’s intention is to be able to track any public funds that are issued and “follow the money.” He said the bill’s primary purpose is to “clarify” the auditor’s power rather than expand it, as the office already has “ample authority” for conducting investigations and audits.
Rep. Pricey Harrison (D-Guilford) said she found the bill’s provision around investigating any individuals who receive state funds to be excessive, noting that it opens up anyone receiving money for Hurricane Helene relief for auditing. O’Steen said those are the sorts of funds that the auditor’s office should be following.
“As far as going after individuals, it’s not the intention of the auditor’s office. Even if it was, there’s no capacity to go that deep into individuals. That’s not the intention or the vision of the Auditor,” O’Steen said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/20240430_163039-1024x709.jpg,,,2025-04-09 10:07:10.078532

Sharice Davids pushes to restore federal family planning funding frozen by Trump,Tim Carpenter,,,,,https://kansasreflector.com/2025/04/09/rep-sharice-davids-pushes-to-restore-federal-family-planning-funding-frozen-by-trump/,U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas is introducing a bill to reverse a Trump administration freeze on Title X funding for family planning clinics.,"U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas, said she would introduce legislation in the U.S. House to restore and shield funding to Title X family planning clinics that was halted by the administration of  President Donald Trump. (Anna Kaminski/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids of Kansas endorsed the introduction of legislation to increase and protect funding to the federal family planning safety-net program after the Trump administration withheld millions of dollars for reproductive health clinics.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said the pause in distribution of appropriated Title X funding allowed for investigation of possible violation of federal laws or executive orders. The review included compliance with Trump’s ban on promotion of diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, policy.
“In Kansas and across the country, people are being turned away from the only places they can afford to get basic, lifesaving reproductive care — all because the Trump administration is playing politics with their health,” said Davids, a Democrat serving the 3rd District in eastern Kansas.
“This bill protects trusted providers and ensures access to cancer screenings, birth control and STI testing, no matter your income, where you live or how you vote,” she said.
The proposed Expanding Access to Family Planning Act would deliver federal funding to help sustain clinics serving an estimated 4 million people annually. In 2023, more than 1.5 million visits to Planned Parenthood health centers were made possible by the program.
Under the U.S. House bill ready for introduction Wednesday, annual federal funding for Title X would be shielded from Republican efforts to eliminate the program. The bill would deliver $512 million annually for 10 years and address the current funding shortfall. The proposal also would allocate $50 million for clinic construction, renovations and infrastructure improvements.
Davids said the legislation would protect Planned Parenthood from being excluded from federal appropriations by the Trump administration.
The bill would reinstate federal regulations prohibiting discrimination against providers of Title X services, while ensuring comprehensive, affordable reproductive health care for patients regardless of income, race, immigration status or gender. It would make certain information and services related to prenatal care, delivery, infant care, foster care, adoption and pregnancy termination were provided.
The Guttmacher Institute, which works to protect sexual and reproductive health and rights, estimated the freeze by HHS could impact access to health care for up to 1.25 million people, many of whom had modest incomes, were people of color or lived in medically underserved communities.
“Data shows that restrictions appearing to target one type of reproductive health care have ripple effects on all aspects of reproductive care, including abortion and contraception,” said Kelly Baden, vice president of public policy at the Guttmacher Institute.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/250228_davids-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 10:07:10.078532

Trump-appointed U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. ordered the closure of five of the nation’s 12 regional offices, as part of an agency-wide consolidation that included cutting 10,000 employees. That included closing the Seattle-based Region 10 office serving Alaska, Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. 
The office was a critical resource for Alaska Head Start programs, for grant administration and compliance, said Katrina Ahlfield, executive director for Kids’ Corps Inc., an Anchorage Head Start program. She also serves on the board of the Alaska Head Start Association.
“​​Thousands of children and families potentially are impacted in the longer term,” she said of the closures nationwide. “If this creates a delay in grant processing, or programs receiving the immediate support that they might need.”
The federal department did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.
Head Start provides early learning programs through schools and nonprofits that serve children from low-income families, from supporting pregnant mothers up to age 5. Foster youth, families who receive supplemental assistance like food benefits, and those who are experiencing homelessness are automatically eligible. 
“We’re looking at some of the most vulnerable children and families in Alaska,” Ahlfield said.
Ahlfield said Kids’ Corps Inc. is one of four Head Start programs impacted directly, currently serving 1,076 children.
Ahlfield said the Alaska Head Start Association heard the news of the regional office closure on March 31 second-hand, and had no direct notice or further direction from federal officials. 
That day, federal staff arrived to work in Seattle and were locked out, according to news reports, and staff were placed on immediate administrative leave until June, without warning.
With that office closed, Ahlfield said there’s a loss in administrative and technical support. 
“They were your experts really on the Head Start performance standards and all of the compliance requirements that come along with operating any federal program,” she said. “So they were kind of your go-to as a director, or go-to for technical assistance and questions. They also help to process your grant applications.”
While there are no immediate cuts or closures, she said the loss of administrative support impacts her organization, as well as and also CCS Early Learning in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley, Thrivalaska in Fairbanks, and the Rural Alaska Community Program, or RuralCap, which serves children and families throughout Alaska. 
Ahlfield said regional administrators would answer questions, or give advice related to health and safety requirements. 
“These people had worked there for, you know, over 10 years, and really knew our programs well, and knew Alaska well,” she said. 
“So right now, we don’t have anyone to contact about any of those kinds of questions or needs,” she added. 
Kids Corps Inc. serves 189 children in the Anchorage area, and Ahlfield said she’s most concerned about their pending grant funding, which she expects to cover costs for the next six months. 
“My most urgent concern is, is this going to create a delay in programs receiving grant approvals and funding on time in order to be able to continue providing services without a temporary, you know, delay and or needing to temporarily close?” she said. 
She said there have not been Head Start funding delays reported in Alaska yet. But the uncertainty is difficult; any program cuts or closures would hit families and staff hard. 
“We have an early-childhood and an educator crisis, where we don’t have enough people in the field already,” she said. “And so it just makes the situation worse for people. It definitely has the potential to create hard times.”
Alaska Head Start receives $68 million in federal funding each year, she said, with a 20% match totaling $13 million provided by the state through the Alaska Department of Early Education and Childhood Development. DEED provides state grants to 17 Head Start programs across the state, in classroom and home-based settings. 
DEED did not respond to requests for comment on Monday. 
Ahlfield said Head Start administrators and communities are calling on the Alaska congressional delegation to urge the Trump administration to reverse the cuts, or provide a clear plan. 
“If it’s not possible to reinstate our regional office, and that would be our first preference, … then we really need and want a well communicated, coordinated plan on how this is going to work, so that it doesn’t impact these vital services,” she said.

The DACA recipient and Kansas father of three feared that he wouldn’t be able to return from Mexico, a country he left at the age of 4. His Roeland Park family embraced in a tearful and joyful reunion at Kansas City International airport.
U.S. Customs and Border Protection had stopped Cortez Martinez at the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport more than two weeks ago, after he took a short trip to Mexico to visit his grandfather’s grave.
He was trying to return to Kansas City.
Instead, he was detained and questioned, then put back on a plane to Mexico City on March 23.
Cortez Martinez is a recipient of DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.
He had never been back to his birth nation, having been brought to the U.S. by his parents as a toddler. His farmworker father tended grapevines in California.
Prior to his scheduled trip to Mexico, Cortez Martinez had applied for and received permission to travel and return to the U.S., a process called “advance parole.”

His case is an example of an immigrant who “did everything the right way” and still ran into problems, said Rekha Sharma-Crawford, the Kansas City-based immigration attorney who filed a lawsuit April 2 on behalf of Cortez Martinez with the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Texas. The case, first reported by The Beacon, drew national attention.
“The lawsuit has been dismissed because you are home and that was really the point of the lawsuit,” Sharma-Crawford told her client at the airport.
The government had asked for time to respond, indicating that the issue could be resolved without the judge hearing the case, said Sharma-Crawford.
There seemed to be some confusion at the time when he was detained in Dallas, Cortez Martinez recalled, because a supervisor had been called over.
Still, Cortez Martinez said he was told that he’d been ordered removed in absentia on June 11, 2024, and that his documents allowing him to travel had been issued in error.
Cortez Martinez said he was never made aware of that order.
“I never got any notice,” he said. “I check everything because there is all of the paper that we get for DACA renewal.”
His current DACA is valid until October 2026.
Cortez Martinez will now have an opportunity to resolve the re-calendaring of removal proceedings in Kansas City’s immigration court, said Sharma-Crawford.
“I trust you,” Cortez Martinez said to Sharma-Crawford. “Let’s talk as soon as possible.”
His children carried a poster they’d made, each signing a note to their father.
They also brought mylar “Happy Birthday” balloons.
Cortez Martinez turned 40 while he was gone. Several other family members also had recent birthdays.
Laughing, Cortez Martinez hugged his wife and declared, “We’ll have one single party.”

Kennedy Jr. and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, one of Utah’s top legislative leaders said he is “excited” about the prospect of making Utah into a “national experiment.”  During a news conference highlighting Kennedy and Zeldin’s visit to Utah on Monday [&#8230;]","U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert Kennedy Jr. (left) and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin (right) listen as Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, (center) speaks during an event at the University of Utah on Monday, April 7, 2025. (Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) After meeting with President Donald Trump’s Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, one of Utah’s top legislative leaders said he is “excited” about the prospect of making Utah into a “national experiment.” 
During a news conference highlighting Kennedy and Zeldin’s visit to Utah on Monday to applaud a slate of “MAHA” bills the GOP-controlled Utah Legislature recently approved, House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, told reporters that during their meetings state and federal officials also talked about the prospect of states taking over the management of a variety of federal programs. 
“We’d like to stand as a national experiment, allowing us … the state of Utah, to keep some of its federal dollars and tax dollars and run some programs,” Schultz said. 
Utah leaders want the state to be a “pilot project” to “help discontinue the federal oversight” of various federal programs, Schultz said, “whether it’s education, transportation, Medicaid, public health, public lands.”

“We manage more effectively, more efficiently and more affordably than the federal government, certainly, but more so than any other state in the action,” Schultz said. “Sign us up. Please.”
The House speaker said “the request has been made” to the Trump administration — which has already made moves to shift regulatory power to the states, most recently with his executive order to dismantle the U.S. Education Department. 
“I’ve been so excited to hear the response back from both” Kennedy and Zeldin, Schultz said. 
When asked about Schultz’s comments, Kennedy told reporters the Trump administration welcomed the idea. 
“President Trump’s vision for this country is that the states should be 50 laboratories around the country, that they should be able to run their own affairs and the best ideas … are coming from the bottom up,” Kennedy said. “We are determined to do that, and we’re talking about doing it already, and we’re going to move very quickly.”
Trump administration to Utah: ‘Get us a list’ of what Utah wants
In an interview with Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday, Schultz shared more details about his meetings with the top Trump administration officials, as well as what he hopes will come of them.
“Such a huge day for the state of Utah and certainly for me and some of the things I’ve been pushing,” Schultz said. 
He pointed to his speech on the opening day of the 2025 Utah Legislature, when he issued a rallying cry for Utah to wrest control of public lands away from the federal government — something Utah’s GOP is more optimistic about than ever given Trump’s election. 
During that speech, Schultz shared the same words as he did Monday: “We’d like to petition the federal government to allow Utah to stand as a national experiment, allowing us to keep a portion of our federal tax dollars, run the programs, and discontinue federal oversight.”

“To our federal delegation, I have three words: Sign. Us. Up,” Schultz said at the time, claiming as he did this week that the state can better manage education, transportation, Medicaid and public lands
Schultz said the meetings with Kennedy and Zeldin “couldn’t have (gone) better.” 
“I mean, it was just like, ‘Absolutely, that’s one of the directives from Trump, giving states more autonomy to deal with their affairs, pushing states can do it better than the federal government can,” Schultz said. “They talked about Utah and how we’ve led the nation on so many fronts, how we’re better managed. So they are very open to it.”
Schultz said their response was “get us a list of the things you want us to look at and focus on.” So now, the speaker said he plans to work with Gov. Spencer Cox’s administration, Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and other state agencies to “see what we can come up with.” 
Adams, in a prepared statement issued Tuesday, focused his comments on paving the way for Utah’s future, especially when it comes to energy production and “independence.” He said “it was great to sit down” with Kennedy and Zeldin to “discuss Utah’s efforts to become an energy hub and how we’re working to build a brighter, healthier future for our children and communities.” 
“Our state and nation need more energy, and Utah is uniquely positioned to lead the charge toward energy independence,” Adams said. “With its abundant resources and innovative spirit, Utah is ready to help ensure a future with reliable, safe and affordable energy. America must become the AI capital of the world because the nation that leads in AI will shape the future — driving economic growth, military power and global peace.”
How would Utah gain more autonomy?
Ideally, Schultz said he’d like Utah’s federal funding to come in the form of “block grants” that would let the state, rather than federal officials, manage the programs. 
“Heck, we’ll do it cheaper,” Schultz said. “Block grant us the money that you’re spending, and, you know, even reduce it 10%, 15%, 20%, or whatever that money is, we’ll have to look at it. But we can do it so much cheaper, so much more efficient and more effective and affordable here in the state of Utah.” 
It’s not yet clear to what extent Utah could take control over federal dollars and programming. Schultz acknowledged there could be limits on what the president or his administration could do without facing lawsuits or other hurdles. 
“There’s some things that Congress has probably given enough authority to the EPA, HHS, and transportation, to make those determinations,” Schultz said. “And then there’s some that probably can’t happen.”

However, Schultz said that if necessary, Utah state leaders will be ready to convene a special session to take action. 
“It’s a priority for myself, President Adams, and Gov. Cox,” Schultz said. “We will come into a special session and make changes necessary on the state side, set policies, to do this.” 
Schultz pointed to Utah’s Department of Environmental Quality, which answers to the EPA, and said that Utah already has more “autonomy” than other states. 
“Here we run a lot of the programs at the state level with guidance from the EPA, instead of having the EPA run those. And so we’re going to look to expand those,” Schultz said. “What can the states take over? What will the EPA give to the states, specifically to Utah?”
Monday’s meetings could ultimately save Utah taxpayers “hundreds of millions of dollars, if not billions,” Schultz said. He claimed that if the federal government turns more control over to Utah and if the federal government cuts down on regulations, especially for transportation and permitting within the EPA, it will result in massive cost savings. 
‘Hands off’ protests
Over the weekend, thousands of Utahns joined the worldwide “Hands Off” protest against Trump and Elon Musk. They protested against Department of Government Efficiency cuts that have targeted services, federal workers’ jobs, and more. 
Schultz acknowledged that in the early months of Trump’s return to the White House, his aggressive actions have resulted in some chaos — but he said “most of that has walked backwards, so the chaos isn’t happening anymore. They’ll be more strategic, they’ll be more thoughtful around some of those things.” 
Schultz also defended Trump embracing Musk and DOGE, arguing the federal government’s spending has been “unsustainable.”
“These are things that needed to happen for decades,” he said, adding that “Trump was very transparent in what he was going to do before he was elected. And people elected Trump on the fact that he was going to put Elon in charge of helping reduce government expenses, go look for corruption, go look for efficiencies. … Those are all good things.” 
Utah, however, has been hit by painful federal layoffs, including the loss of dozens of public health workers in state and local health departments. Though he said those layoffs were of “temporary employees,” Schultz also acknowledged that the timing of the announcement that Trump would be cutting COVID-19 funds short was sudden. 
“Having a little bit of time to work through it would have been much better, and we did talk about that with (Kennedy),” Schultz said. “Having even 30 days or two weeks heads up … would have been much better. But you know, we’ll find a way through it.” 
He also acknowledged that some cuts targeted mental health funding, “and we have a shortage of mental health workers in the state of Utah.” 
Still, while “layoffs are tough and never easy,” Schultz also defended the moves as necessary to tamp down on federal spending.

David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, speaks to a colleague on the floor of the Alabama House of Representatives on Feb. 11, 2025 at the Alabama Statehouse in Montgomery, Alabama. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee advanced a bill allowing the state’s dominant agricultural organization to offer its members health benefit plans but not before making several changes to the legislation.
HB 477, sponsored by Rep. David Faulkner, R-Mountain Brook, would allow a nonprofit agricultural organization — fitting the description of the Alabama Farmers Federation (Alfa) — to provide health plan options not subject to state insurance regulations. 
The bill was the subject of a tense public hearing last week in which farmers’ economic fears were pitted against consumer protection concerns. Faulkner told the House Health Committee Tuesday that he had agreed to changes to move the bill forward.
“I think the bill, as is before you, is in great shape, and I don’t think it needs any amendments,” he said. “But still, to address concerns, like we’ve done, we are going to have some amendments today.

Lawmakers introduced eight amendments. A ninth amendment that would have limited who could be denied coverage based on a pre-existing condition was not considered after Faulkner said “it would kill the bill.”
Of the eight amendments, six passed, including one of which Faulkner considered “not friendly.”
That amendment, offered by Rep. Frances Holk-Jones, R-Foley, added a line stating that the Alabama Department of Insurance would enforce the legislation passed. Holk-Jones did not explain the amendment to Faulkner, who claimed he did not understand it, but she said in the public hearing last week that as a career insurance professional, she wanted to be sure that the organization’s plans were explicitly stated in law, instead of an expectation it would be included in the contract.
Faulkner objected to the amendment. 
“This is too vague for me to understand and what that means, and I don’t know that the Department of Insurance would know what that allows them to do or they can do,” Faulkner said.
Another amendment by Holk-Jones, which Faulkner considered “friendly,” requires insurance agents and brokers to be licensed by Alabama, a concern she also shared during last week’s public hearing.
Rep. Bryan Brinyark, R-Windham Springs, offered an amendment that prohibits the nonprofit agricultural organization from increasing premiums if a policyholder utilizes their health benefit plan.
“I hope we’re getting a better product for the members. That’s what I care about. I want to make sure that the people in my district are getting the best plan that they can get under this bill,” Brinyark said.
Faulkner said that he wanted to “just echo [Brinyark’s] comments” and said that had been the intent.
“I just wanted to say because I agree with your comments, and what we’ve said is that once you’re covered on this plan, you’re not going to be canceled or your premium raised based on an individual health condition,” Faulkner said.
Rep. Jeff Sorrells, R-Hartford, offered an amendment that shifted the premium tax from the Department of Revenue to the Department of Insurance. An amendment by Rep. Mark Shirey, R-Mobile, requires the organization providing the health plan to cover some of the out-of-network costs of emergency care.
An amendment by Rep. Neil Rafferty, D-Birmingham, also passed, requiring the health plan to include mental health and substance misuse care, as well as prescription drugs to covered benefits.
“I think I don’t have to go into too much elaborate details on why this is crucial and important for all people in the state,” Rafferty said.
Another amendment from Holk-Jones that would have required the nonprofit agricultural organization to submit an annual report on the number of people it covers failed after Faulkner called it “unnecessary.” Another amendment by Rep. Pebblin Warren, D-Tuskegee, would have prohibited the organization from adding or amending annual or lifetime limits without notice, but Faulkner said he could not accept that.
“It doesn’t mean I’m not willing to continue to talk and work on this. We have been working on this even today, and so I would ask for the committee not to pass this at this time, because I do believe it’s dealing with something that is highly unlikely to ever happen,” Faulkner said.
Holk-Jones pushed back, saying that “if you’re not planning on, if it’s highly unlikely, then it shouldn’t be a problem.”
“All I think Rep. Warren is asking for is the highly unlikely possibility that this is done, that the amendment would say that there would be a 60-day notice,” Holk-Jones said.
Faulkner said after the committee meeting that he expects the House to consider the bill on Thursday.

Joe Lombardo and law enforcement officials from Northern Nevada would turn back the clock on modest reforms passed by lawmakers with bipartisan support in 2019. 
“This legislation was drafted to put teeth back into Nevada’s penal code, hold criminals accountable, empower judges and prosecutors and support victims of crime,” Lombardo said at a news conference Tuesday in front of the Carson City sheriff’s office. 
The bill’s introduction comes on the heels of the revelation that the Nevada Department of Corrections has a $53 million budget deficit. 
“I was convinced the Governor’s crime bill being released at the same time NDOC shockingly shared it paid $60m in overtime and predicted worse deficits in the near future was a joke, but it was apparently serious,” ACLU of Nevada Executive Director Athar Haseebullah said via email. “It’s incumbent on the Governor to share how he plans on paying for his relic-of-the-past crime bill.”
Prison guard musical chairs incurs $60 million in overtime, $50 million shortfall

Last session, Lombardo spearheaded the Crime Reduction Act, which increased penalties for drug dealers, and limited early discharge from probation for gun violations.
“It’s evident that more work remains in our fight to secure our communities,” Lombardo said Tuesday. 
Lombardo, on the campaign trail in 2022, blamed increases in crime on Assembly Bill 236, which was passed in 2019. His current legislation comes amid a reduction in a number of crime categories and increases in others. According to data from the State of Nevada, from 2023 to 2024: 

Property crime was down 12.37% 
Domestic violence was down 2.81%
Violent crime was down 6%
Crimes against the elderly were up 31.86%
Hate crimes were up 88% from 2023, but down slightly from 2020

The legislation, Senate Bill 457, would enact multiple measures to toughen penalties and broaden the scope of infraction on the books.
“Historically, partisanship has prevented meaningful progress for public safety, but I am hopeful we can push past this session,” Lombardo said. 
Lombardo’s Safe Streets and Neighborhoods Act would increase costs for the Nevada Department of Corrections by $3.6 million in the current biennium, by just under $7.2 million for the next biennium, and by $42.2 million in future bienniums, according to a fiscal note. 
“Much of the long-term increase is due to habitual criminal convictions with delayed effects,” NDOC wrote in the fiscal note. “For lesser sentences, this delay will take on average a year after implementation for an effect to begin.”
NDOC projects the reforms would add 38 offenders a year to the prison population, with an average incarceration of 6.5 years. 
“For greater sentences, effects are expected to take up to 20 years to begin to materialize due to sizable average existing sentence lengths, even when the habitual criminal sentence is excluded,” according to NDOC. The department estimates 111 additional offenders would return in the first fiscal year after their release, increasing to 215 the next year. 
“This increase is expected to continue until a plateau is reached at 632 additional offenders. The average total daily cost per offender in FY 2025 is $91.43,” NDOC notes. 
Last week, NDOC director James Dzurenda testified the department is racking up $60 million in overtime a year because of the need to shift correction officers from one post to another to address staffing shortages, resulting in a $50 million dollar budgeting shortfall that took lawmakers by surprise. 
“It’s the utmost importance to me to ensure that the law enforcement community has the tools in order to change the crime picture in our communities, and we will figure out a way through the government processes and all the available funding resources available to us to address those particular issues,” Lombardo said Tuesday, adding he is “evaluating time served for non-violent offenses” and projects a savings of $37 million a year as a result. 
“Additionally, we will work through the existing bills that are going through the state process, and we can balance the budget to address this,” he said. “In my level of importance and triage we deal with in state government, nothing is as important…”  
Haseebullah says Nevada’s district attorneys’ offices should disclose how much it will cost to prosecute the additional cases envisioned by Lombardo’s legislation.
The D.A.s, he says “have opposed record sealing bills for bullshit arrests that were dismissed with their opposition based on cost considerations, but magically, something like this is free for them.”
Lombardo’s legislation:

Enacts tougher penalties for theft, burglary and for repeat offenders;
Provides an additional penalty for offenders who commit new crimes while released from incarceration but are still under sentence; 
Allows separate charges for each sexual image of a person under the age of 16;
Lowers the threshold for felony theft charges from $1200 to $750;. 
Imposes mandatory minimum sentences and increased penalties for trafficking large quantities of fentanyl;
Eliminates diversion programs for offenders who victimize children, the elderly, and vulnerable adults;
Imposes a sentencing enhancement for felonies committed by offenders on pre-trial release; 
Revises stalking crimes to include dating relationships, social media and other electronic means; 
Lowers the threshold of the number of felonies required for conviction as a habitual criminal; 
Expands marijuana and marijuana metabolite thresholds for intoxication; 
Increases penalties for DUI offenses resulting in death;
Domestic batterers would be required to surrender their firearms; 
Increases burglary punishments, which were reduced in 2019;
Extends the time for a bail hearing, set in 2021 at 24 hours, to 72 hours;
Requires that any payments collected from a criminal defendant be first applied to pay restitution to the victim;
Requires that any money collected from a defendant be used to satisfy restitution before it can be applied to court fines and fees;
Ensures that a felony DUI offender who is in a diversion program will be subject to another felony for driving impaired;
Increases the penalty range for DUI causing death to  one to 20 years to five to 25 years; 
And allows DUI offenders to be charged in certain cases with second degree murder.

“Nevada has no money left to experiment on antiquated tough-on-crime policies which continue to devastate our budget and don’t make our community safer,” Haseebullah observed. “We’re about to face cuts statewide on basic services. I have no idea how anyone with any common sense would view this type of exorbitantly expensive regressive idea as a plus, but these types of performative messages seem to be the Nevada way.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama House committee Tuesday approved a bill that would impose new regulations on consumable hemp products amid concerns over youth access and a lack of oversight of the products.
HB 445, sponsored by Rep. Andy Whitt, R-Harvest, would give the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) Board authority to license and regulate the manufacturing, distribution and retail sale of hemp-derived consumables and banning their sale to anyone under 21.
Whitt said that there were “recent developments” that made the bill more urgent and read a press release from Herbal Oasis, a company that produces hemp-derived products that planned to expand to Alabama, saying “their product will be in convenience stores, grocery stores and other locations throughout Alabama and Florida Panhandle, starting in late March.”
“This is exactly what we discussed last week that we were trying to do, was stop this product being served in such a manner,” Whitt said.

In a public hearing Wednesday, opponents of the bill said that there was a lack of data for what Carmelo Parasiliti, founder and CEO of Green Acres Organic Pharms in Florence, referred to as a lawmakers’ “hysteria,” and that data from the Alabama Poison Information Center suggests it is currently affecting less than .1% of children in Alabama. Opponents also suggested a study commission to develop “evidence-based policy” on cannabis regulation.
Under the proposed law, consumable hemp products could only be sold in regulated, 21-and-over retail environments — either standalone hemp product stores or existing off-premise liquor stores approved by local authorities.
The bill sets a five-milligram THC limit per serving and prohibits marketing or packaging that appeals to minors. It also bans vending machines and self-serve displays for such products.
“We do have some bad activities that are our problems,” Whitt said, referencing children’s snacks being used to market these products, but he did not reference evidence supporting the claim. “You’ll not see the Doritos, the Airheads and things like that that are strictly marketed for our kids.”
The bill also creates civil and criminal penalties, such as fines starting at $1,000 for exceeding allowed THC percentages or a Class C misdemeanor, with punishments of up to 30 days in jail and up to a $500 fine, for failing to keep records like invoices for inspection, an excise tax, and a dedicated compliance fund. It would repeal an existing law that currently allows the sale of psychoactive cannabinoids to adults.
Rep. Jeremy Gray, D-Opelika, said he did not oppose the bill but wanted to study the matter further. 
“What I would encourage is that we look at… an economic impact study and maybe a task force… so that way we actually know the facts.”
The bill passed by voice vote and now moves to the full House for consideration.

Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman from Washoe County believes Nevada should replicate a state-managed private insurance program already in place in 34 states [&#8230;]","Flames engulf the vegetation surrounding residential neighborhoods as the Pinehaven Fire burns on November 17, 2020 in Reno, Nevada. (Photo by Trevor Bexon/Getty Images)Thousands of homeowners in Nevada have seen their insurance policies canceled or not-renewed due to wildfire risk, prompting state lawmakers to warn that “a crisis is brewing” and considering ways to combat it.
Republican Assemblymember Jill Dickman from Washoe County believes Nevada should replicate a state-managed private insurance program already in place in 34 states and the District of Columbia.
Dickman is sponsoring Assembly Bill 437, which would establish a Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan – an insurance program of last resort for homeowners who cannot reasonably obtain coverage through standard insurance providers. Her bill is one of two bills making its way through the Nevada State Legislature focused on home insurance availability amid increasing wildfire risk.
FAIR plans, which have been around since the 1960s, provide coverage for homeowners who cannot find policies on the private market. The plans are managed by the state governments, but they are backed financially by a pool of the private insurers.
California’s FAIR plan has received the most public attention and criticism because of its size and the prevalence of wildfires in the state, but Dickman told the committee that Nevada’s FAIR program would not look like its western neighbor’s.
Dickman wants Nevada’s FAIR plan to remain “a true market of last resort” that does not compete with the private market. To ensure that, she has drafted a conceptual amendment specifying that homeowners be denied by three standard insurance companies before being eligible for Nevada FAIR. They must also attempt to secure non-FAIR coverage every two years.
Homeowners would also be required to undergo a wildfire risk assessment and implement its recommendations.
The Nevada Fire Chiefs Association worked with Dickman on AB437. Representatives from the group emphasized the need to mitigate fire risk.
Elko County Fire Chief Matthew Petersen estimated that once a week he receives a phone call from someone asking for help because their home insurance policy is getting canceled.

Dickman has also capped what FAIR will insure – $5 million for commercial properties and $750,000 for residential properties.
She acknowledged those limits are relatively low considering the cost of housing in many parts of the state. The median price of a home in Washoe County is currently around $550,000.
“We have to start somewhere,” said Dickman. “We’ve been talking about this, and talking about this, and talking about it, and there’s never any action taken. We’re looking for the perfect plan.”
Nevada, she argued, cannot afford to delay taking legislative action knowing it will also take time to implement any program. She noted Colorado passed legislation to create a FAIR plan in 2023 and is only beginning to offer coverage this year. 
“If we put it off for two years, it’ll be another two years, and by then we’ll be in a crisis,” Dickman added. 
In 2023, 481 homeowners insurance policies were canceled or non-renewed due to wildfire risk — an 82% increase compared to the previous year, according to the Nevada Division of Insurance. That same year, nearly 5,000 applications for homeowners insurance were declined due to wildfire risk — a 104.8% increase over the previous year.
Cadence Matijevich, a lobbyist for Washoe County, said there is a misguided assumption that wildfire insurance is “an issue of the 1%” involving multimillion homes in Incline Village.
“That’s not true,” she said. “We’ve heard heartbreaking stories from senior citizens who’ve lived in homes for 50 years and are at risk of losing their homes because they couldn’t get property insurance.”
The American Property Casualty Insurance Association and the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies oppose the FAIR plan proposal.
APCIA in a letter of opposition wrote that a FAIR plan “fails to address the underlying issues that result in less affordable or available coverage.”
Instead, the industry is supporting a separate bill meant to give them more flexibility in the types of insurance plans they can offer Nevadans.
Regulatory sandbox
Republican Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill is sponsoring Assembly Bill 376, which would create for insurance companies what’s known as a “regulatory sandbox” that allows them to test out new types of plans that don’t fit under current state regulations. The sandbox program would exist for 4 years, after which the Nevada Division of Insurance would have to submit to the Legislature a report with information and recommendations.
Nevada Insurance Commissioner Scott Kipper, who presented the bill with O’Neill, told the committee the idea is to incentivize companies to create “innovative products” by giving them “some flexibility to generate revenue that is needed to manage risk.”
O’Neill, who represents Carson City and parts of Storey and Washoe counties, said his bill uses model language drafted by the National Council of Insurance Legislators.
AB376 doesn’t mandate any type of product be tested but does provide some potential options, including removing wildfire coverage from the standard homeowners policies and offering it as a standalone package.
The bill received a mixed reaction from committee members. Democratic Assemblywoman Sandra Jauregui said she is supportive of regulatory sandboxes to spur innovation. She pointed out that the Legislature passed one for the fintech industry in 2023.
Democratic Assemblymember Max Carter expressed concern that insurance companies might be attempting to free themselves of having to cover wildfire damage. “Are we turning everyone loose and letting the fires burn down our houses?”
That concern was echoed by the Consumer Federation of America, which opposes the bill.
“This is a shoot first, ask questions later approach that is certain to increase premiums and put consumer financial security at risk,” the organization wrote in a letter of opposition.
The Assembly Commerce and Labor Committee has taken no action on either bill.
Dickman’s FAIR plan bill must clear the committee by Friday or it will be considered dead.
O’Neill’s regulatory sandbox bill is exempt from legislative deadlines, meaning it has more time to advance. Kipper told the committee he is working on ways to get the bill’s fiscal note ($237,000 over the upcoming biennium) removed.
O’Neill and Dickman’s bills are not mutually exclusive, and the latter assemblymember is listed as one of several sponsors on the former’s bill.
Washoe County testified in support of both bills.
Risk in Nevada
Nearly one-fifth of Nevada’s land area has been burned by wildfire in the past 40 years, landing the state fifth in the nation for land area burned by wildfires.
A new study by the Lied Center for Real Estate at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas found that more than 18% of Nevada’s land mass has been torched by wildfire from 1984 through 2024.
Northern Nevada has experienced a significantly larger number and total acres burned by wildfires than Southern Nevada, due to the differences in climate, terrain, and the presence of forested land. 
Rural counties in Northern Nevada were the most affected by wildfires in the state. Elko County had the largest percentage of land area burned by wildfire at 41%, followed by Humboldt at 39%, according to the study. 
One fourth of Washoe County’s land area has been burdened by wildfires. Carson City, the state’s capital, also experienced noticeable burns with 15% of its land impacted by wildfire.
In Lincoln County, a rural county in Southern Nevada, about 18% of land mass has been burned by wildfires since 1984.
In Clark County, Nevada’s most populous county, only about 5% of its total land burned by wild fires in the past 40 years.
The Lied Center’s study was based on Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity wildfire data, a joint program administered by the United States Geological Survey and the United States Forest Service to map wildfires across the country.
Lied Center for Real Estate Research Director Nicholas Irwin, who co-authored the study, told the Current that as more people move into forested areas wildfires are likely to become much more economically destructive moving forward.
“Coupled with the climate change we’re seeing, longer drought, increased temperatures— that’s going to make wildfire seasons a lot a lot worse,” he said.
While other states have experienced more economically destructive wildfires, the number of wildfires impacting infrastructure in Nevada has increased in recent years. 
In September, the Davis Fire broke out in Davis Creek Regional Park, about 20 miles south of Reno. The wind-driven fire rapidly burned through 5,824 acres of private, state, and federal lands, driving the evacuation of about 20,000 people from residential neighborhoods and businesses. The fire ultimately destroyed two commercial buildings and 14 residences.
Nevada’s fire season, once limited to late summer and early fall, now spans nearly the entire calendar year.
High wildfire risk makes areas less attractive for developers,  impacting housing development, said Irwin. Rural areas, which already deal with high construction cost and other barriers to development, could be disproportionately impacted
As Dickman put it during the AB437 hearing: “You can’t sell a home you can’t insure.”
These concerns are contributing to this year’s push for  legislative action.
Beyond the proposals currently being considered, Irwin said Nevada could take a more proactive role in monitoring wildfire risk as other states do. In Colorado, the Colorado State Forest Service maps wildfires in an effort to inform homeowners and business owners of the impending risk for their location based on fire conditions.
“It’s very costly, but it is very informative, and there’s research out there to suggest homeowners respond to that information,” Irwin said. “Knowing the relative risk of that land is going to be really important so we can think about how to build strong and resilient homes that won’t be at risk for future wildfires.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1229661053-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 08:04:15.620828

(Getty Images)Data on households in Nevada facing power or gas shut offs due to nonpayment amid scorching summers and frigid winters is largely unknown.
That could change under a bill that would require utilities to report on a quarterly basis the number of disconnections due to non-payment broken down by month and zip code. Senate Bill 442, sponsored by the Senate Committee on Growth and Infrastructure, was presented to lawmakers by state Democratic Sen. Melanie Scheible on Monday.
Nevada does not require utilities to publicly disclose the number of customers they disconnect, leaving little transparency to understand the full extent of disconnections. Nationally, 26 states and Washington D.C. require some level of public reporting on utility disconnections due to nonpayment.
Limited data collected by  utility regulators shows a growing trend in the number of residents in the state who have had their power cut due to nonpayment. Nearly 32,000 Nevadans had their power disconnected by NV Energy for nonpayment in 2024, according to the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada. 
“The information that we do have highlights the need for better reporting,” said Olivia Tanager, the director of the Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter which covers Nevada and the Eastern Sierra. The Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter recommended the bill and helped present the bill to lawmakers on Monday.
Supporters of the bill say mandatory disconnection reporting by month and zip code would provide health departments, community-based organizations, and public services in Nevada with the data they need to identify the communities most at risk of disconnection. That data could then be used to focus public assistance on where, and when, it’s most needed.
“We continue to see rising utility costs associated with more extreme weather and an increasing number of households facing financial difficulties. It is vital that we have the data we need to understand the full scope of this issue and take informed, meaningful action,” Tanager continued. 
According to the most recent data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration, 1 in 4 American households experience some form of energy insecurity – an inability to afford household energy needs – each year, with little improvement over the past decade.
“These disconnections can have severe consequences, not only leaving individuals and families without essential services like electricity and heating, but also contributing to broader economic and social instability,” Tanager said during the Monday hearing on the bill.
During the hearing, both NV Energy and Southwest Gas testified as neutral on the bill, noting their existing energy assistance programs as well as the potential benefits of the bill in directing outside resources.
The legislation’s advocates say the Trump administration’s ongoing policies to pause and/or cancel disbursement of federal funds cast doubt on the stability of federal energy affordability programs. 
Federal employees for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) — which provides funding to help low-income households pay for energy costs — were fired last week as part of a dramatic restructuring of the Department of Health and Human Services, making the future of the program unclear.
In 2024 Nevada received $17 million in LIHEAP funding to help about 12,000 low-income households keep their lights on. 
“All of those folks that administer that program were unfortunately fired, and so there is some question about the longevity of LIHEAP and how that’s going to impact folks,” Tanager said.
Several advocacy groups testified in support for the bill Monday including, the Northern Nevada Central Labor Council, United Way of Southern Nevada, the Nevada Environmental Justice Coalition, Mormon Women for Ethical Government, and the Moms for Clean Air. 
Congress has expressed an interest in determining the scale and scope of electricity disconnections in recent years. In 2022, Congress directed the U.S. Energy Information Administration to begin collecting monthly data on utility disconnections, but the lack of public data has made comprehensive national data difficult to obtain, according to the Congressional Research Service.
Limited data does show that Black and Hispanic households are statistically more likely to have their power disconnected, according to a 2023 report on electric utility disconnections by the Congressional Research Service.
“The intent of the bill is to make sure that we have regular information so that we can drive services that exist to help folks keep their lights on where they’re most needed, when they’re most needed,” Tanager said.

Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) over his support for President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
Graduating from American University’s Washington College of Law, Swartz worked as an appellate attorney for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs prior to serving as deputy general counsel for Western Michigan University.
Swartz previously ran against Huizenga in 2024, winning 43.4% of the vote while Huizenga received just over 55%. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
However, both the Swartz campaign and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee see a path to victory, with the DCCC listing Michigan’s 4th Congressional district as one of its targets for 2026. Additionally, EMILY’s List, a political action committee that backs women candidates who support abortion rights, has also identified Huizenga’s seat as one they hope to flip next year.
Regardless, the nonpartisan Cook Political Report has rated the district in Huizenga’s favor, listing it as a “likely Republican” victory.
“Prices were already too high, and now career politician Bill Huizenga’s making them even higher while injecting chaos into our economy,” Swartz said. “West and Southwest Michiganders deserve a representative who’s laser-focused on bringing costs down, getting inflation under control, creating good-paying jobs, and making sure every working family can retire with dignity. From Day One in Congress, I’ll bring a working parent’s perspective that our current Congressman has completely lost.”
The district spans all of Allegan and Van Buren counties as well as parts of Berrien, Calhoun, Kalamazoo and Ottawa counties.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/Jessica-Swartz-Headshot-MI4-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 08:04:15.620828

(Photo by Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A camel, it has been said, is a horse designed by a committee.
A committee of state GOP leaders recently designed a “historic” income tax-cut plan.
But what they delivered was a camel: lopsided, ungainly, and reeking of a bad attitude.
Worse, they put the cart before the camel, announcing the tax-cut plan with much ballyhoo and bunkum before realizing that it doesn’t cut taxes for most South Carolinians.
It actually raises taxes in 2026 for 60% of South Carolinians (or nearly 1.7 million tax filers), as per estimates released by the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office a week after the big announcement.
The bill includes huge tax cuts for some, but those cuts overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy.
Roughly 9,900 tax filers with more than $1 million in income would see their taxes cut by an average of $31,000, according to reporting by S.C. Daily Gazette Editor Seanna Adcox.
Many others would get little or nothing.
The bill was supposed to be fast-tracked for approval, but now House leaders have postponed debate while they explore other options.
No, I’m not making this up.
This was a hugely embarrassing episode of DOGE-level ineptitude by the people who are supposed to be leading our state.
Redesigned camel
At least the bill was shelved for the moment. But Rep. Brandon Newton, chairman of Ways and Means’ tax policy subcommittee, said Republicans remain “committed to passing income tax reform this year.”
That means another tax-cut camel may soon be galumphing along the dusty road to the Statehouse.
Whatever rough beast emerges out of ongoing discussions, the General Assembly should reject it.
State lawmakers should not cut taxes.
The postponed bill slashed taxes by more than $200 million, with a provision to cut $200 million in taxes every year when revenue projections rise by 5%. A revised bill might cut taxes by that amount as well.
We simply can’t afford that. Our state has too many critical needs that should be addressed right now, including infrastructure, education, health care, crime and public safety.
We should remember that the General Assembly just cut taxes over the past few years by a whopping $1 billion, on top of sending $1 billion back as rebates in 2022, limiting the ability of lawmakers to deal effectively with the state’s top needs, such as fixing our notoriously awful roads.
A bold new plan called Momentum 2025 offers great hope for upgrading our roads, but it carries a price tag of $1 billion a year. There’s no plan, however, to fund Momentum 2025, as Adcox pointed out in an excellent commentary tracing the history of our road woes.
The state faces other critical concerns, such as the teacher shortage that results in potentially thousands of South Carolina students beginning each school year without a fully qualified teacher in the classroom.
Health care challenges
We’ve got dire healthcare challenges in South Carolina as well. An estimated 521,660 South Carolinians under age 65 lack health insurance, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.
We should follow the lead of 40 other states in expanding Medicaid, drawing down billions in federal funds and investing some state money to provide health care coverage for an additional 360,000 low-income South Carolinians.
In addition, with Medicaid threatened by cuts on the federal level, state lawmakers may need to step in to protect South Carolina’s most vulnerable citizens.
South Carolina also needs to invest more in children, especially in the areas of prenatal care and childcare.
South Carolina ranks near the bottom of the nation for child care affordability. Overall, our state ranks among the worst in the nation for the well-being of children, according to the annual Kids Count.
The S.C. Department of Juvenile Justice, meanwhile, has been plagued by overcrowding and other unsafe conditions.
South Carolina desperately needs to invest more in law enforcement as well. Our state has one of the highest murder rates in the nation and one of the highest rates of fatalities on the road, which includes one of the highest rates of drunken driving deaths.
One study called South Carolina “the most dangerous state for drunk driving in America.”
A tax cut doesn’t solve those problems.
And state lawmakers have made big new promises to South Carolinians this year, including plans to spend $60 million that we can’t afford on school vouchers. You can bet Republicans will want to spend a lot more on that in the future as well.
Lawmakers who support a big tax cut argue that it’s needed to keep South Carolina growing, but that’s not a problem. We’re already one of the fastest-growing states in the nation.
Finally, it would be irresponsible to cut state taxes with the U.S. economy in a tailspin as the stock market and consumer confidence plummet.
With Washington in chaos, we need sober heads in Columbia to address our state’s most pressing needs, and that doesn’t include a big annual tax cut.
State leaders have to be the adults in the room.

Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy | Arizona MirrorThe leader of Immigration and Customs Enforcement said that his dream for the agency is squads of trucks rounding up immigrants for deportation the same way that Amazon trucks crisscross American cities delivering packages.
“We need to get better at treating this like a business,” Acting ICE Director Todd Lyons said, explaining he wants to see a deportation process “like (Amazon) Prime, but with human beings.”
Lyons was one of a series of Trump administration speakers at the 2025 Border Security Expo at the Phoenix Convention Center, including Tom Homan, Trump’s “border czar”, and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
Most extolled Trump’s use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans, and Noem promised to expand its use to swiftly deport immigrants.
Several speakers, including Homan, told the military industrial complex representatives in the crowd that the Trump administration is depending on the private sector to implement its mass deportation agenda.
“We need to buy more beds, we need more airplane flights and I know a lot of you are here for that reason,” Homan told the crowd in his keynote speech, which kicked off the expo.
“Let the badge and guns do the badge and gun stuff, everything else, let’s contract out,” he said.
Homan, who served as the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during Trump’s first term and backed the controversial “zero tolerance” policy at the southern border, and has been connected to far-right extremist and conspiracy theorist groups.
He was one of two keynote speakers at the annual Border Security Expo, a trade show event that features hundreds of military and tech companies, many with controversial backgrounds, all aiming to secure federal contracts or expand existing ones. Organizers initially told the Arizona Mirror that media could not attend, but opened the doors to the press after the late announcement that Noem would be a second keynote speaker.

The Trump administration has made border security a top priority, and the administration’s actions have faced scrutiny for their lack of due process and unprecedented efforts to keep mass deportation plans a secret, even from American courts.
The Mirror examined the list of companies in attendance and found that some of them have ties to Trump and his allies, such as Andruil Industries, which is tied to Trump ally Palantir, and whose director of defense technology was nominated by Trump to serve as the Army’s No. 2 official. Private prison company Geo Group, an ICE contractor who has seen its stock price skyrocket since Trump’s election, also was present at the event.
Many of the event’s sponsors also have ties to Trump, including one organization that is on the advisory board of the Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025.
Homan defended the controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act, the 1798 law that was last used during World War II to intern Japanese Americans.
“That is a law enacted by Congress, and we are using that,” Homan said, adding that it “bothers him” when judges or politicians attempt to prevent him from using it. Shortly before Homan spoke, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration can use it for now.
He also said that family detention is still “on the table” as a policy, claiming that it is about ensuring that “families are families” and preventing human smuggling.
Homan wasn’t the only top immigration official to speak at the expo. Shortly after his keynote address, he joined a panel that included Lyons, Deputy Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection John Modlin and Deputy Chief for the U.S. Border Patrol David BeMiller and others for a “State of the Border” discussion.
Lyons said that he hopes that they can infuse artificial intelligence into the process to “free up bed space” and “fill up airplanes” taking immigrants back to their home countries at a faster rate.
Much like Homan, Lyons also shared that he supports the use of the Alien Enemies Act, calling it “amazing” to be able to speed up the process of deportations. He also said that he has been working with billionaire Elon Musk’s U.S. Department of Government Efficiency to get social security numbers to look for “voter fraud.”
There has been no evidence of widespread voter fraud connected to illegal immigration.

Noem told the packed ballroom at the Phoenix Convention Center that they are “extremely close” to “operational control” of the border as migrant arrests at the border have reached the lowest numbers they’ve seen in decades.
Before appearing at the Border Security Expo, Noem participated in an ICE raid in Phoenix that included about 100 federal agents. Among the people embedded at the raid was anti-LGBTQ influencer Chaya Raichik.
Echoing Trump’s campaign rhetoric, Noem said there has been a “war and an invasion” at the southern border — longtime talking points for white supremacists — while saying that the administration plans to use “new technology,” including biometrics, not just along the border but in the “interior” of the United States.
Much like the officials that spoke before her, Noem praised the use of the Alien Enemies Act and said that she would be working to defend its use. And she pledged to put the current operation “on steroids” to speed up the deportation process.

And Noem praised Musk and DOGE.
“I think the Department of Homeland Security has been their biggest partner,” Noem said of DOGE, claiming that the non-governmental agency has helped DHS find waste and abuse.
Noem also defended Trump’s use of tariffs to launch a global trade crisis and tank stock markets in the U.S. and around the globe.
“It will look like a roller coaster for a little while,” Noem said to an attendee who asked how the tariffs could impact DHS’s work. Noem added that she believes that the tariffs will help American families in the long run.
The event Tuesday was said by organizers to be the largest in its history, with the most attendees and vendors ever present. The expo floor was packed with members of both local and federal law enforcement. The Mirror observed members of the Apache Junction Police Department, Phoenix Police Department and U.S. Army, as well as border patrol agents.

(Illustration by Alex Cochran for New Jersey Monitor)Donor interest in New Jersey’s gubernatorial election catapulted upward along with the number of candidates, state election law officials said Tuesday.
Aurea Vazquez-Alexander, compliance director for the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, said during a commission meeting that the number of contributions to gubernatorial candidates participating in the state’s public financing program increased by 374% compared to 2021, the last time New Jersey held a governor’s race.
“There has been a significant increase in contribution volume and review complexity from 2021 versus 2025,” she said.
One of the commission’s tasks is to review donations to gubernatorial candidates to make sure they comply with public financing rules. The spike in donations means the eight candidates receiving public financing this year have submitted more than 38,000 contributions for the commission’s review, up from just over 7,900 four years ago.
Vazquez-Alexander added that the steep rise in contributions was not solely the result of a larger candidate pool.
“In 2021, the highest contribution count for any single candidate was 5,968 contributions. In 2025, a single candidate received over 13,000 contributions — more than the entire 2021 total,” she said without naming the candidate.
Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, cannot seek reelection in the fall. Among the six Democrats vying in the June 10 primary to succeed him, Rep. Mikie Sherrill has received the most in matching funds, $5.1 million through April 3. In the five-man Republican primary, former Assemblyman Jack Ciattarelli is the first candidate to max out his $5.5 million in primary matching funds.
Candidates are due to disclose their fundraising for the first quarter of 2025 by April 15. 
Five Democrats — Sherrill, Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, Rep. Josh Gottheimer, and former state Sen. Steve Sweeney — have qualified for matching funds. Three Republicans — Ciattarelli, state Sen. Jon Bramnick, and former radio host Bill Spadea — are receiving matching public dollars.
In all, 11 gubernatorial candidates will be on the June 10 primary ballot. Sean Spiller, a Democrat and president of statewide teachers union the New Jersey Education Association, and Republicans Justin Barbera and Mario Kranjac did not qualify for matching funds by the March 24 deadline. Candidates must raise and spend $580,000 to be eligible for matching funds from the state.
The number of candidates running for governor this year is far from record-setting, said Joe Donohue, the commission’s deputy director. Donohue noted 22 candidates ran for the governorship in 1981, the first year New Jersey candidates for governor could receive matching funds. Sixteen candidates received public financing that year.
Still, it’s been 35 years since eight candidates received public financing, he said.
“In terms of the year with a lot of candidates, it’s in the top five, definitely” Donohue said of 2025.
The public financing program offers candidates who meet fundraising and spending thresholds a 2-to-1 match in exchange for an agreement to observe spending and fundraising caps set by the commission.
This year, they must agree to spend no more than $8.7 million on the primary, or $18.5 million in the general election. As of April 3, the program has dispensed more than $29.6 million.

The House and Senate are both looking at putting new limits on the reimbursement rates that health insurance plans for state workers and public school employees pay. Both chambers’ budget proposals also depend on taxes that could apply to hospitals with larger amounts of revenue.
“There’s going to be less money for patient care,” said Chelene Whiteaker, senior vice president of government affairs at the Washington State Hospital Association. 
On the other side of the debate are advocates who contend that hospitals are not paying their fair share in taxes and that care should be more affordable.
“Patients are always the ones who are asked to tighten our belts or skip needed lifesaving care to protect mega hospitals’ bottom lines,” said Sam Hatzenbeler, senior policy associate at the Economic Opportunity Institute. “There is an inherent imbalance that needs to be addressed.” 
“Everybody’s being asked to tighten their belts, but the health care industry is not asked ever to tighten theirs,” she added. 
But industry officials say hospitals are still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and grappling with rising expenses that often outweigh revenue.
According to the hospital association, Washington hospitals lost $1.74 billion in 2023. While the number is high, it was an improvement from the $2.1 billion hospitals lost in 2022. 
In 2023, state lawmakers moved to strengthen hospitals’ finances by approving a plan to secure more federal Medicaid dollars. 
House Majority Leader Joe Fitzgibbon, D-Seattle, noted that hospitals are one of the largest recipients of state tax dollars through Medicaid, public employee insurance payments and Cascade Care, which is a public health care coverage option available in Washington.
“It’s a tough spot to be in, no question, but the reality is our budget is very squeezed right now and we’re going to have to ask hospitals as well as other beneficiaries of state payments to tighten their belts,” he added.
Hospitals are also facing uncertainty at the federal level as Republicans in Congress contemplate cuts to Medicaid. 
Eric Lewis, the hospital association’s chief financial officer, said Medicaid cuts combined with the proposed state policies “could send hospitals back into financial distress.”
Both chambers had proposed bills — Senate Bill 5083 and House Bill 1123 — to limit health insurance reimbursements for hospitals under health plans for state and school employees. Senate Bill 5083 is still in play. It passed the Senate in March with only Democratic support and now awaits a floor vote in the House.
Supporters say that in addition to lowering state spending, the bill will also reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients.
But by capping the amount a health plan pays for services, the hospital association estimates $170 million in revenue would be lost. 
Oregon has adopted a comparable policy, while states like Colorado, Nevada and Connecticut are looking to pass similar legislation. Hatzenbeler said that in Oregon, the state saved $100 million in the first two years and that out-of-pocket costs fell by 9.5% for patients.
Meanwhile, the House is looking to increase the state’s business and occupation tax, which would affect businesses making over a certain amount of revenue. Some large hospitals would pay the higher tax. Around 20% of hospitals — along with some other entities affiliated with them, like doctors’ offices and long-term care facilities — would pay around $110 million to $130 million more in taxes annually under the House plan, the hospital association estimates. 
The Senate is also contemplating a new payroll tax on large employers, which the hospital association says would raise hospitals’ tax bills by about $160 million a year. 
Hospitals say if these proposals passed, they would be under pressure to negotiate with private insurers to offset the financial hit. If those negotiations aren’t successful, then hospitals would be left looking at options like service cuts or layoffs, or allowing wait times to rise for patients.
“We do understand that the Legislature is dealing with a budget deficit, but this level of damage that these proposals are doing is intense,” Whiteaker said. 
Larry Delaney, president of the Washington Education Association, the largest union for public school educators in the state, said that with many people already struggling to afford health care, hospitals should lower executive pay before asking patients to shoulder more of the burden.
“Corporate executives cry wolf every time they’re asked to do their part,” Delaney said. “[Senate Bill 5083] gives many Washington workers hope for more affordable care.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/hospital-room--1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 08:04:15.620828

Some of Florida’s private colleges and universities are raising concerns about the House’s proposed budget, which would restrict the state’s Effective Access to Student Education award, also known as EASE, which provides $3,500 to Florida students attending private institutions.
The House budget proposal, which at $113 billion is $4.4 billion less than the Senate’s, calls for schools to meet benchmarks related to graduation and affordability set by the state to be eligible to receive EASE money. The Senate budget does not propose metric requirements. 
Bob Boyd, president of Independent Colleges and Universities of Florida, called the metrics “arbitrary.”
The University of Miami, University of Tampa, and Bethune-Cookman University are among the 15 schools that would be ineligible to receive EASE money if the language is included in the final budget. ICUF estimates about 22,000 students would lose EASE funding.
The EASE grant, established in 1979, is similar to the recently expanded K-12 voucher program in that taxpayer money is used to pay for private school tuition. The House budget would provide $135.9 billion for the program in the coming fiscal year, in line with current year funding of $134.8 billion.
Mike Allen, president of Barry University in Miami Shores, said the proposal “doesn’t track” with the Legislature’s “priorities around school choice that have been made very, very clear.”
Republican Rep. Demi Busatta, chair of the House Higher Education Budget subcommittee, said she is “always open to having a discussion” when asked whether she was open to a glide path to implement the metrics. 
“I think the most important thing is that the money per student is the same. It has not decreased. We have not changed it,” Busatta said, adding that change would not affect students’ eligibility for Bright Futures scholarships. 
She said she has had “many meetings” with ICUF and its institutions including UM, and other stakeholders.
“There’s institutions out there that have a 14- or 15% graduation rate. We want to make sure that students aren’t going, getting into debt when they are not having the best opportunity to be set up for success at that institution.”
ICUF data show some of its member institutions have four-year graduation rates as low as Busatta suggested, including Webber International University, Barry University, and Bethune-Cookman University.

Republican Rep. Mike Caruso, vice chair of the subcommittee, told the Phoenix he is against the private institution restrictions in the House budget proposal as well as the $5 billion cut to the overall budget.
“I think it’s a trickle down from the proposed budget cut of $5 billion from leadership that’s working its way down through the different silos and things are going to suffer as a result,” Caruso said Tuesday.
Caruso said the “big hand of the state puts their foot down on just about everything.”
“These private universities serve a purpose, a tremendous role in the way that we have education, and the EASE program helps to facilitate it. I don’t like these restrictions, we put our hand into everything and we continue to do that,” Caruso said.
‘Ripple effect’
According to ICUF, its institutions produce 28% of nursing degrees and 25% of teaching degrees in the state. 
“The ripple effect can occur in many directions and in many ways, but certainly one will be that this will really limit our ability, particularly here in South Florida, to provide basic services that people need to live here, and I think that would really affect folks,” Allen said, adding that several of the private schools train nurses, a field the state has focused on bolstering amid a shortage. 
Hospitals are “in a panic about the inability to find enough nurses to staff their hospitals,” Allen said. 
“When it comes to the EASE grants, they are essential for thousands of our Florida students,” Caruso said, adding that the language “may be cracking down on the universities, but what we’re really hurting is the students themselves, and those students are the future nurses, the future technicians, the future of our state.”
The House proposal would require schools to have graduation rates of at least 54%, retention rates of at least 67%, and affordability rates of $6,183, among other measurements. 
Private institution presidents told reporters Monday that factors unique to each university could unfairly exempt students, including how the state calculates accessibility and how it considers graduation rates and course drops when students transfer.
Rep. Gallop Franklin, Democratic ranking member on the House Higher Education Budget subcommittee, told the Phoenix implementing changes to EASE should be more “methodical.” 
Franklin said the proposal would affect 22,000 students instantly and result in immediate costs spikes on  students. Franklin suggested grandfathering people in and having conversations with institutions to minimize disruption, or to offer less than $3,500 for the coming year if there are budgetary concerns. 
Franklin said he is not sure that the government should “be in the space of saying, ‘Hey, we’re only going to allow you to take your voucher to certain schools.’”
Budget tightening
Tightening EASE disbursements is part of House Speaker Daniel Perez’s budget, which is lower than the current year’s budget, and comes amid talk of cutting the sales tax by 0.75%. 
Boyd complained the state is using “arbitrary metrics with arbitrary percentages to implement a budget cut — that’s the way I look at it.”
David Armstrong, president of St. Thomas University in Miami Gardens, said supporting private schools helps keep students in Florida. 
“The fact that the Florida state schools are ranked Number One in the country is fantastic for all of us as the citizens of the state, but who has picked up the role as the access schools?” Armstrong said. “In our state, it’s the community college system and the smaller private institutions that are enrollment-driven. Now that works out fine, because that’s a part of our mission, serving those who are underserved.” 
Lawmakers will debate the budget Wednesday before heading into negotiations with the Senate.
“I think most of our institutions will survive. It’s the impact on the students. Because this is a voucher program. This is not a grant to the institution. This is a direct dollar, per dollar, to that student to go to school and use for their education,” said Art Keiser, chancellor of Keiser University in Fort Lauderdale.

Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state.
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

Bill Hardwick of Dixon to his right, watch how members are voting Monday on a bill authorizing video lottery terminals. (Rudi Keller/Missouri Independent)A bill allowing the Missouri Lottery to install video gambling machines at retail locations across the state faces a difficult path to final passage — even if the sponsor can find enough votes to get it out of the Missouri House.
Republican state Sen. Brad Hudson of Cape Fair, who also filed a bill allowing video lottery games, said in an interview Tuesday that he hasn’t pushed his proposal forward because it was assigned to a hostile committee.
Three Senate bills authorizing video lottery games were assigned to the Senate Appropriations Committee. None have received a hearing.
“When it comes to putting a committee in a situation where I don’t feel like I have the votes, I’m not going to be pushing for a hearing on something like that,” Hudson said.
That leaves the House bill, given first round approval Monday by a 74-70 vote, as the only legislation in a position to pass by the end of the session. There were two members who voted present and 16 who were absent, during the vote on the bill sponsored by state Rep. Bill Hardwick, a Republican from Dixon. 
That is eight votes shy of the 82 needed for the House to pass it to the Senate.
Lobbyists favoring the bill said privately that there are 10 members who were absent on the Monday vote who will support it on the next vote. Lobbyists opposing the bill said privately that there are at least 10 members who voted for the bill on first approval who will vote against it on the next vote.
“If they do get to their 82, then we’ll be having some conversations in the Senate about that particular bill,” Hudson said.
But winning passage with only five weeks left before mandatory adjournment — and with the state budget unfinished — “would be a heavy lift,” he said.
The bill awaiting another House vote would:

Allow video lottery games in licensed retail locations. There is no limit on the type of locations except they are prohibited in recreation centers marketed for children. There is no limit on the total number of games statewide;
Require the games to be in a location “distinct and divided from the primary business operation area”;
Declare unlicensed games, called “gray market” games, to be illegal slot machines;
Require affirmative votes in cities and counties to allow the games and create a process for additional votes to prohibit the games afterwards;
Double the boarding fee at casinos to $4 and direct the extra funds to the Missouri Veterans Commission.

The machines will be required to pay out at least 80% of the money wagered in prizes. The remainder will be split three ways — the lottery will receive 34% of the net to support state education programs, with retailers and operators splitting the other 66%.
The fiscal note for the bill estimates that within three years, there will be $1.1 billion for the three-way split — from about $5 billion wagered — generating approximately $350 million in state revenue. 
The gray market games that resemble casino slot machines operate in almost every county of the state. They have proliferated despite efforts by the Missouri State Highway Patrol to initiate prosecutions under anti-gambling laws. After years of operation, convenience store owners, fraternal lodges and other establishments have become dependent on the revenue.
The best-known of the gray market game operators is Torch Electronics of Wildwood, which has a strong lobbying presence in the Capitol to oppose any effort to restrict its business and is a prolific political giver.
When Hardwick brought the bill to the floor, he had prepared an amendment that would strip provisions requiring retailers to give up gray market machines if they became video lottery retailers. The provision also would have required the removal of all gray market machines within six months of the launch of video lottery.
But during debate, an amendment directly declaring any unlicensed machines to be illegal slot machines was added.
“I call this, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck, and in this case, smells like a duck, it’s a duck,” said state Rep. Jim Murphy, a St. Louis Republican who offered the amendment. “We need to regulate these gray machines.”
Hardwick had only one significant question about the amendment as he sought votes.
“I’m going to ask everyone the same question: If your amendment gets on, will you support the bill?” he said.
“Yes,” Murphy replied.
“Nothing further, Mr. Speaker,” Hardwick said.
In recent years, Senate debate on gambling has been split among casino supporters, who wanted sports wagering, video lottery supporters and those who were happy with no action, leaving the gray market machines in place.
Hudson said his top goal for legislation on video lottery is to eliminate the gray market machines.
“I’ve gotten reports of kids playing these machines,” Hudson said. “We can’t have this. We need to do something about it. I don’t think this issue is going to just go away.”
During House debate, defenders of the gray market machines said allowing them to operate was a question of liberty. State Rep. Bryan Wolfin, a Republican from Ste. Genevieve, called the licensing and rules in the bill “a complex and ridiculous system that grows government” and questioned whether the gray market machines are as menacing as some see them.
“These things have been in this gray area for the last five or six years, and to my knowledge, Missouri is still operating,” Wolfin said.
Hardwick defended the bill as a compromise that allows the revenue flow to continue while assuring the public that the machines offer a fair chance of winning.
“At this point, almost everybody in the building is dissatisfied with our product to some degree, and that’s because I did not create a product that was trying to advantage one business over the other,” Hardwick said.
The final vote split both parties. There were 28 Democrats who voted for it along with 46 Republicans. There were 16 Democrats opposed, joining 54 Republicans.
If the final eight votes can be found to move the bill to the Senate, Hudson said, he will be looking at the bill to determine whether it adequately suppresses gray market machines without a net expansion of gambling.
“My goal is to restrict, regulate and (to) protect kids,” Hudson said. “I am opposed to gambling expansion. I am not going to be getting behind legislation that I feel like is an expansion of gambling.”

The drought declaration, which began in 2023, covers the Upper Yakima, Lower Yakima and Naches watersheds. Kittitas and Yakima counties and part of Benton County are part of the drought emergency.
Seven other counties are in a drought advisory status, including Okanogan and Chelan counties and Pierce, King, Snohomish, Skagit and Whatcom on the west side of the state, according to the Washington Department of Ecology.
Although snowpack has improved in the Yakima Valley, there won’t be enough spring runoff to replenish reservoirs and soil after two back-to-back years of drought, state officials said.
During a news conference in Seattle on Tuesday, Department of Ecology Director Casey Sixkiller said six of the last 10 years have seen a drought declaration for some part of the state.
“This is the new normal: More rain, less snowpack, earlier springs, hotter, drier summers, and increasing odds that snow droughts will happen 4 out every 10 years,” he said. “This isn’t a future threat; it’s happening right now.”
Sixkiller said the state wants to shift from treating drought as an emergency response “to something we plan for and build around.”
 Conditions in Yakima Valley

Droughts involve multiple factors, said Karin Bumbaco, deputy state climatologist. It’s not just about lack of rain, but also the timing of the rain, snowpack levels and the timing of snowmelt.
“There are many ways to make a drought,” she said.
This year, a lack of precipitation in the central and northern Cascades resulted in below-normal snowpack. The Upper Yakima Basin is at 75% median snowpack, and even though the Lower Yakima and Naches watersheds are at near-normal snowpack, it hasn’t been enough to make up for deficits the past two years, she said.
The Upper Yakima Basin has a long-term precipitation deficit of 33 inches, she said. The five reservoirs that feed the Yakima River — Keechelus, Kachess, Cle Elum, Bumping and Rimrock — are at 59% of normal, the fifth-lowest levels since 1971.
Climate change has lowered snowpack levels across the state, Bumbaco said. There has been a 25% decrease in snowpack since the 1950s, and there could be a further 50% decline by the end of the century, she said.
 Continuing drought 

A third year of drought could have enormous consequences for the $4.5 billion agriculture economy in the region, which grows 71% of the nation’s hops, 63% of its apples and 62% of its cherries.
The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation estimates this year’s water supply for junior water rights holders in the Yakima Basin will be 58%, affecting irrigators in the Roza Irrigation District and Kittitas Reclamation District.
A drought that results in 70% of normal water supply could impact up to 6,000 jobs and result in up to $424 million in direct losses, according to the Department of Agriculture.
Drought is declared in Washington when less than 75% of normal water supply is available and there is risk of “undue hardship” to water users or the environment.
The declaration will open up $4.5 million in drought emergency response grants for public utilities like irrigation districts. Caroline Mellor, statewide drought lead for Ecology, said it’s $1.5 million more than usually provided because of leftover one-time funding in 2023.
Mellor said that Ecology can give out $3 million in the grants per fiscal year when there is a drought declared. The regular emergency funding is important, but Ecology still has a need for funding for drought preparedness and resilience, she said.
 Potential federal impacts to Washington response

Trump administration funding cuts and pauses, and job terminations could impact the state’s ability to respond the drought.
Sixkiller said the state needs “stability and commitment” from its federal partners. Drought response requires partnerships with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Bureau of Reclamation.

Bumbaco said that the state relies on federal government for its data, including on temperature, precipitation, stream flow, soil moisture and snowpack. The data is used for forecasting drought, determining impacts and determining water availability.
“Without accurate data, we can’t reliably forecast supplies,” Sixkiller said.
Federal funding is also essential for projects like water storage, he said.
Sixkiller said Gov. Bob Ferguson is committed to making the state more drought- and climate-resilient.
 Wildfire risk

With drought comes increased wildfire risk.
Matt Dehr, wildland and fire meteorologist for the state Department of Natural Resources, said that prescribed burning has been an effective method for reducing fire risk across the state, and the agency wants to increase its use.
“One thing that a little less precipitation in the winter gives us is that opportunity to do more prescribed burns,” Dehr said.
The low reservoir storage levels are indicators that forests could be stressed from lack of water, he said. Forests stressed from drought, disease and overcrowding are more susceptible to fires.
DNR has shored up its aerial support with a fleet of drones that can map heat and start burns in areas unreachable by firefighters, he said.

I’d known the difficulty of being locked into a job I didn’t want for the sake of health care coverage, and felt the strain of ever-increasing charges for routine preventative care. So when Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi announced that the Affordable Care Act passed, I wept.
The ACA is one of the most consequential health care reforms in our country’s history. It expanded affordable coverage to people previously locked out of health insurance, lowered premiums and out-of-pocket costs, and helped the nation’s uninsured rate reach an all-time low.
But dismantling the law — without any plan to replace it — remains a top Republican priority.
The ACA protects over 100 million people like me with pre-existing conditions from being charged more — or denied coverage entirely — by insurance companies. It guarantees free preventive care for over 150 million Americans and allows young adults to stay on their parents’ insurance plans. More Americans than ever count on the law. As of 2024,a record 24.2 million Americans are enrolled in quality coverage thanks to the Congressional Democrats who passed tax credits that make health care more affordable for middle-class families purchasing coverage on their own.
But today, we stand at the edge of a health care cliff — again. Republicans want to cancel these tax credits. If they succeed, they would kick 5 million Americans out of the insurance market and spike premiums for the rest of us, just to fund tax breaks for the ultra-wealthy and big corporations.
Unless Congress acts now, premium costs will skyrocket for families across Minnesota, including my own. On average, a Minnesotan family of four would pay $4,000 more for their premiums, and 16,000 Minnesotans will lose their insurance entirely. Our neighbors who are self-employed, small business owners, older adults who don’t yet qualify for Medicare, people living in high-cost rural areas, farmers and people with pre-existing conditions will all suffer — all to finance tax cuts that help primarily benefit the wealthy.
Lower premium costs gave my family more room to pay for other necessities like food and gas. And I know I’m not alone — ACA coverage in Minnesota has more than doubled thanks to the Democrats who have worked tirelessly to protect and expand the ACA. Losing these savings would be devastating to millions who may otherwise not be able to access health care. Families should not have to choose between being able to see a doctor or keeping a roof over their heads.
If Republicans are serious about bringing down costs, they will ensure the ACA tax credits remain available for families for years to come and that people with pre-existing conditions can continue to afford coverage. It is time for Republicans in Congress to get on board and protect the health care of millions of Americans.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-1442374624-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-04-09 08:04:15.620828

More than 900 students from throughout the U.S., including Indiana, are expected to participate in a national Jobs for America’s Graduates (JAG) Career Development Conference April 24-26 in Indianapolis.
That the conference is being held in our state is worthy of celebration.
Regrettably, the future of JAG in Indiana is in jeopardy. The current Indiana House budget does not include funding for JAG. It is essential that full funding be restored and the day-to-day administration of the program be maintained by local nonprofit workforce development boards.    
JAG is a national workforce preparation program that provides opportunities for success to students who have experienced challenging or traumatic life experiences. Indiana’s JAG program is among the best in the nation. 
The workforce development boards that oversee the program are dedicated to developing, attracting and retaining talent. These organizations are led by regional employers, who often participate in providing JAG students with real-world projects and work experiences. 
Students learn a host of in-demand employability skills and are given a proven bridge to post-secondary education, the workforce or other career enhancing opportunities. In Indiana, JAG was recently expanded to 250 programs and it is expected that 10,000 students will participate annually.
The JAG graduation rate of 96.6% in 2024 was higher than the overall state high school graduation rate of 90.2%. Those who graduated earned $20.4 million in scholarships. 
Moreover, mid-year 2024, JAG statewide registered more than 2,000 engagements with employers. It has a job placement rate of 55.2%, making it a premier generator of talent to meet the needs of employers.
Workforce pipeline
It’s more than an education program. It is an essential multifaceted experience that directly links to building and sustaining the workforces in our region and state. 
Students learn and compete in such areas as career decision making, business planning, financial literacy, project-based learning, and prepared speaking.  
Combined, EmployIndy and the Region 5 Workforce Development Board oversee a total of 48 JAG programs in central Indiana. Ten of our high-achieving JAG students are expected to participate in the national conference. 
Students, like Riley Coots of Pendleton High School, are our future workforce leaders.
“I joined JAG to gain a competitive edge in my professional life,” Coots says. “I have learned the importance of time management, especially when balancing work and school.  Honing my skills and preparing for my next life phase was why I joined JAG; however, I have gained much more than I expected regarding personal growth.”
Adds Lilliana Mendoza of Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis: “JAG gives you a place to be your best. My JAG specialist is very supportive and I think the check-ins (after graduation) will help keep me accountable as I pursue my degree.” 
We are proud to have the national conference in Indiana to celebrate not only the country’s talent but the achievements of our state’s young people under the stewardship of Indiana’s workforce development boards. 
We can ill afford to deny students such a powerful opportunity and ignore the impact of a workforce program that works, especially as our region focuses on supplying our employers with enough skilled talent to ensure a robust economy for years to come.

The measure will need a final signoff from the Senate before it can be sent to Gov. Mike Braun.
“I think this is a good first step (for lawmakers) to sit at the table, and for us to review those things that we’re looking for when it comes to … fiscal responsibility, accountability and transparency,” said Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne, who sponsored the bill in the House.
More contract scrutiny
The bill is part of a Senate GOP priority bundle and has been coined a “government efficiency” measure by the majority caucus. 
The House-passed plan is “paired down” from the Senate’s draft, Lehman said. Amendments on the chamber floor and in the Ways and Means Committee removed several earlier provisions in an effort to “refine and streamline” the overall bill, and to avoid unnecessary requirements or “inhibitions” on vendor negotiations.
But at its core, the latest draft of the proposal is the same: increase accountability around state contracts.
Except agreements “solely entered into for licensed legal counsel” by executive branch offices, state agencies would no longer be allowed to a grant contracts without a request for proposals (RFP) that is posted on the department’s website for at least 30 days prior to the deal.
The Indiana Capital Chronicle revealed late last year, for example, that multiple no-bid contracts have been awarded by the Secretary of State’s Office.
Secretary of state spending includes millions in no-bid contracts

Reporting showed roughly $4 million in IT-related contract dollars were awarded by the office without RFPs. The agreements do not appear on the Indiana Transparency Portal ​​where such records are typically housed and made public, but a list of contracts has since been published on the secretary of state’s website.
Under the bill, however, all Indiana agencies, statewide offices, local governments, nonprofit organizations and state educational institutions would be required to input contracts into the state’s transparency portal within 30 days of signature. Quarterly reports must additionally be turned in to the state budget committee detailing all of the agency’s active contracts.
State agencies would further be required to undergo budget panel review when making “significant” contract amendments and before applying for new federal funds that require an Indiana match. To better track federal dollars awarded to the state, separate quarterly progress reports to budget regulators would be mandated, too.
State contracts of $500,000 or more would have to include “clearly defined scopes and success metrics” for vendors, along with penalties if expectations and deadlines are not met. Only contracts entered into by the Indiana Department of Transportation for work on highways, roads and bridges would be exempt.
Another provision lets state agencies use artificial intelligence software to prepare required disclosure and projections that must be submitted to state budget regulators.










I think this is a good first step (for lawmakers) to sit at the table, and for us to review those things that we're looking for when it comes to … fiscal responsibility, accountability and transparency.


– Rep. Matt Lehman, R-Berne


As far as office staffing, the bill requires that permanent, full-time positions that have been vacant for 90 days or more must be “reauthorized” — meaning changes are made to the authority, duties or responsibilities in the job listing — or eliminated altogether.
And although Baldwin, the bill author from Noblesville, earlier said his goal was to create a “no-bid list” of companies that are temporarily disqualified from bidding on any more state contracts, such language has since been deleted.
In committee discussions, Lehman maintained “that there are already methodologies” in place for agencies to “sanction or disqualify bad contractors.”
“So, we’re not going to do something statutorily that they can currently do administratively,” he explained.
One Democrat airs concerns
The bill breezed through the House chamber without any floor discussion on Tuesday.
But Dvorak — the only representative to ultimately vote unfavorably — expressed concerns the day prior about exemptions for legal counsel contracts.
“When it comes to legal services, that has been a growing percentage of many departments’ budgets over the last several years — to the extent that there’s often millions of dollars spent on outside legal contracts,” Dvorak said. “I’m sure much of that is for very legitimate purposes. The fact remains, though, that we as legislators need to be aware of what those contracts are, why our state agencies are engaging outside counsel, what that counsel is actually doing, and how much they’re charging. Taxpayers deserve that information, as well.”

Dvorak said he was especially worried that executive offices could use the carveout to hide critical agreement details and taxpayer dollars spent on attorney contracts.
“I think there’s a way you can exempt the information that might be confidential or covered as work product or attorney-client privilege in the transparency portal, while still having the guts of the contract be public. And that’s the important part,” he continued. “There’s potential for insider dealings here — backdoor deals. I just think you’re creating the opportunity for bad dealings to happen when you make these things exempt from public transparency.”
Lehman clarified, though, that while specifics within counsel agreements “would not necessarily be disclosed, the contract itself would be.” He held that only parts of the contract “that go into the details of the agreement between the attorney and their clients” would be shielded.
“I think the concern here is, can I hide an amount in a contract? The answer is no. … That’s not the intent of this. The intent of this is to make sure we’re protecting client-council privileges,” Lehman said. “Once that contract is adjudicated, I think the amount that you spent — because we have to pay the bill — the amount that was spent will be disclosed.”
Democrats raised other questions about which provisions, if any, would apply to quasi-government agencies like the Commission for Higher Education, Indiana Economic Development Corp. and Indiana Finance Authority.
Some would qualify, Lehman said, but because “a lot” of quasi-agencies contracts require non-disclosure agreements or similar requirements in their contracts, “I think those would be out because of that.”
“The issue we get into … with some of the quasi-governmentals is, where do you stop?” Lehman added. “I think on this bill, overall, we’re trying to go down a path for just (more) integrity and transparency, and we don’t know what we don’t know. And I think we’re going to have the next 10 months to look at how this works, and I think we’ll probably be back next year with some other things that may need to be addressed.”

Mike Braun Tuesday. “If organizations like the Indiana Economic Development Foundation were created to assist state agencies with public business, then Hoosiers need full transparency into how [&#8230;]","Former Gov. Eric Holcomb on a trade mission to Germany and Switzerland funded by the Indiana Economic Development Foundation in 2022. (Photo from IEDF)A secretive state-affiliated nonprofit aiding economic development efforts would have to disclose its funders — retroactively and into the future — under an executive order signed by Gov. Mike Braun Tuesday.
“If organizations like the Indiana Economic Development Foundation were created to assist state agencies with public business, then Hoosiers need full transparency into how these nonprofits operate, who funds them, and what they do with the money,” Braun, a Republican, said in a news release.
“Today’s executive order mandates that these organizations file financial disclosures — including those missed over the past 10 years — so Hoosiers can have full transparency and accountability,” he continued.
The Indiana Economic Development Foundation (IEDF) operates in conjunction with the controversial Indiana Economic Development Corp. (IEDC), a quasi-public state agency.
Indiana had a traditional commerce agency until 2005, when then-Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican, signed into law legislation creating the IEDC. Shortly after, leaders created the corresponding IEDF, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization.
The agency and its foundation operate as a public-private partnership.
The foundation has paid for virtually all the international travel for prior governors on economic development trips.
Initially, some donor information was provided. But, in recent years, the foundation has refused to disclose such details.
It does identify some contributors and sponsors on its website, including the state’s “big five” investor-owned utilities: AES Indiana, CenterPoint Energy, Duke Energy, Indiana Michigan Power and the Northern Indiana Public Service Company.
But how much they give is kept secret.
In 2023, the Capital Chronicle found that outside organizations donated nearly $3 million to the foundation over three years. But who the donors are — and how the agency spends their contributions — is largely unknown. State rules don’t require or outright prohibit disclosure of that information.
A little-known nonprofit boosts Indiana’s economic development agency

The groups behind all but two of 16 transactions in records from 2020 through 2022, obtained by the Capital Chronicle, were permitted anonymity. Two didn’t request anonymity: Washington, D.C.-based think tank The Urban Institute donated $5,000 in 2021, and Indiana’s Battery Innovation Center, in Newberry, gave $12,000 in 2022.
The IEDF also said that, because the funds are private donations, how they’re spent isn’t subject to public records rules.
Julia Vaughn, executive director of watchdog group Common Cause Indiana, said the executive order is an acknowledgment that the IEDC and its foundation have, “for many years, operated behind an opaque curtain of darkness that has created distrust of the agency and its actions.”
“This is a positive step to bring much needed transparency to the IEDC and the projects it supports,” she added.
Other organizations also affected
Braun’s release said the state has created numerous nonprofit groups to supplement agencies, like the Healthy Hoosiers Foundation, Indiana Destination Development Foundation, Indiana State Museum Foundation and more.
All government-affiliated non-profits need to file a Form 990 annually with the IRS that describes where their funding sources, how much they brought in, and how the dollars break down between programs and administrative expenses. This form provides Hoosiers with important transparency into these organizations.
But in 2012, the IEDF got an exemption from the IRS for future filings of the form, according to the release.
State-affiliated foundations are also required to file annual reports with the State Budget Committee — which the IEDF has not done since 2019.
Braun directed all state-affiliated foundations to comply with reporting requirements, including filing any previously missed reports from the past decade, by the end of the year. They must additionally file Form 990s annually, even if they have previously been granted an exemption, retroactive 10 years.
The forms “must be clearly posted on the relevant agency’s website for Hoosiers to read for themselves,” the release says.
A new approach
The governor also signed two other executive orders Tuesday changing Indiana’s approach to economic development.
One is to reassess the economic development regions in the state and better capitalize on regional strengths.
Braun said he wants to spread out economic development efforts geographically, “and one important way we’re doing that is starting from scratch on the map of our state’s economic development regions to better reflect each area’s strengths.”
His order empowers Commerce Secretary David Adams to make recommendations on the redrawing of regional economic development and workforce maps based on an area’s “unique” strengths, assets, workforce capabilities, natural resource and industries.
The second executive order focuses on wage growth and job creation in measuring how effective the state’s economic development strategy is. Those numbers will go in all project proposals and performance reports related to state-supported economic development initiatives.
“Indiana is focusing our economic development efforts on the things that affect your family the most: raising wages and new job opportunities. More jobs, and higher pay: that’s our North Star,” Braun said in the release.
Former Gov. Eric Holcomb’s administration focused on capital expenditure and investment totals.

Some of them have no idea.,Anna Claire Vollers,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/04/09/a-fifth-of-americans-are-on-medicaid-some-of-them-have-no-idea/,"About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled in Medicaid.","HOUSTON, TEXAS - AUGUST 18: An Emergency Room nurse tends to a patient at the Houston Methodist The Woodlands Hospital on August 18, 2021 in Houston, Texas. Across Houston, hospitals have been forced to treat hundreds of patients in hallways and corridors as their emergency rooms are being overwhelmed due to the sharp increase in Delta variant cases. Hospitals are straining to keep up with the surge of new coronavirus patients as schools and business's continue to reopen. Houston has seen an upward increase in Delta infections, and research is showing the Delta variant to be 60% more contagious than its predecessor the Alpha variant, also known as COVID-19. (Photo by Brandon Bell/Getty Images)Some Americans who rely on Medicaid to pay for their health care don’t realize their insurance is funded by that very program, which congressional Republicans are looking to shrink.
One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”



Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
 Public debate

Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.










It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician


From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
 Making the connection

Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

(Photo by Kyle Phillips/For Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Over 30 complaints of government waste and inefficiency in Oklahoma have been flagged as “ideas of note” and considered by House lawmakers during budget discussions. 
House budget chair Trey Caldwell, R-Faxon, said the House’s Government Efficiency Portal, which launched in December, received around 250 complaints, but many were “spammy and junk.” 
The portal, which was modeled after President Donald Trump’s federal Department of Government Efficiency, received about 75 actual submissions, about 20% of which are legitimate claims of waste, he said.
Some of the submissions were used in budget hearings to inform questions lawmakers asked of agency directors, he said. 
Some of the “spam” was as simple as what people receive in their email inboxes, Caldwell said, but many were filled with “vitriol against a specific statewide elected officer.” Caldwell said he did not want to name that person.
House leaders voluntarily provided a list of 35 submissions, which they’ve identified as “DOGE Ideas of Note” in response to a request by Oklahoma Voice.
Ideas on the list ranged from consolidating within state agencies to reducing the number of traffic signs on Oklahoma highways. 
Three submissions recommended reducing the number of school districts to consolidate administrative staff and share resources, while another recommended doing the same with the state’s 25 public institutions for higher education. 
Consolidation of state storage and warehouse facilities, state vehicle fleets, and printing services were also recommended. 
Other submissions noted inefficiencies when working with state agencies to obtain car tags, medical assessments, food stamps, childcare, health care and “vital records.” 
One submission said the “over abundance” of unnecessary traffic signs “numbs drivers” and “litter” highways. An example included “speed limit signs increasing over a short distance” because “people know how to speed up.” 
A couple of submissions questioned the need for Oklahoma Turnpike Authority to air television and radio advertisements. Someone else questioned why the OTA and the state Department of Transportation were separate agencies and if there was overlap in services. 
Another recommended comparing job titles of state employees to consolidate duplicative tasks and re-evaluating the salaries of highly paid public servants. 
The submissions provided to Oklahoma Voice only included the submitted idea and not any identifying information about the person using the portal.

Brad Little signed a bill on Friday approving a budget increase for the state’s new Office of the State Public Defender.  The office was established in October to consolidate the public defense offices in all 44 counties into a new statewide agency.

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed a bill on Friday approving a budget increase for the state’s new Office of the State Public Defender. 
The office was established in October to consolidate the public defense offices in all 44 counties into a new statewide agency. The agency was appropriated $52 million in its first year to cover the remaining nine months of the fiscal year, but it has since faced budget shortfalls. 
Senate Bill 1202 addresses those shortfalls, adding $6.7 million in supplemental funding to the 2025 fiscal year budget to pay for transcript costs, additional personnel and contracting costs and funding for Child Protective Act appropriations. It also enhances the 2026 fiscal year budget to $83.2 million. 
 2026 budget addresses contract attorney pay, salary increases by merit

In a blog post on Tuesday, the Office of the State Public Defender thanked the governor, his staff and bill sponsors, Reps. Dustin Manwaring, R-Pocatello; Jon Weber, R-Rexburg; and Sens. Kevin Cook, R-Idaho Falls; and Todd Lakey, R-Nampa, for supporting a budget increase. 
The approved 2026 budget is $5 million less than the amount the governor first proposed after negotiations within the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee. That’s largely because rather than raising the hourly rate for contract attorneys from $100 to $150 — as the governor proposed — the Legislature settled on raising it to $125 per hour. 
Idaho public defender’s proposed budget seeks increases to address defense in rural counties

Of the 39,000 cases the agency has had to cover since it began operation, 9,300 of the cases require a contract attorney. The raise is meant to improve public defense coverage in Idaho’s rural counties, which largely rely on contract attorneys. Likewise, the budget is raising the rate for contracted investigators, who help contract attorneys, from $65 to $85 per hour. 
Attorney shortages remains the agency’s biggest challenge, agency spokesman Patrick Orr told the Sun. 
The budget appropriation seeks to address that challenge, by adding $6.4 million in merit-based salary increases, increasing pay for attorneys handling complex litigation and making wages competitive with similar agencies like the Idaho Office of the Attorney General.
After the agency took over Idaho public defense, the agency changed its pay structure based on an attorney’s length of service. This led several experienced attorneys in Idaho’s more populated regions to resign after receiving pay cuts ranging from $5,000 to $40,000, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. 
“We need more attorneys,” Orr said. “That’s why we are so thankful for the support from the governor’s office and the Legislature. We’re confident our new salary matrix and increased hourly rate for contract attorneys makes us competitive. Public defense is one of those vitally important jobs in society where you have to find the right people to do the work.  Public defense is not an easy job. It’s hard. But it matters.”

Ed Soliday (center) introduces his amendment to a utility pole attachment measure on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Suit-clad lobbyists on Tuesday offered careful praise for a compromise intended to resolve a long-running fight over the utility pole attachment required to bring high-speed internet to rural Hoosiers and others. Disagreements between electricity and telecommunications providers could muddle more than a billion dollars of government broadband incentives.
“For years, … the most difficult barrier to rural broadband deployment in Indiana has been the math,” said Joni Hart, of Comcast Indiana.
It’s often prohibitively expensive to install broadband infrastructure for few customers situated far apart. But Indiana has poured money into access improvements in recent years — and was allocated a whopping $870 million through the federal Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program to make more progress.
‘Number-one obstructionist’: Electricity co-ops lambasted for slow broadband rollout

Now that the money is taken care of, new obstacles have emerged.
“With this funding committed, our industry and policy makers have more at stake in tackling deployment barriers like permitting and pole attachment issues in order to make sure we get this infrastructure deployed,” Hart added. She said those snags have forced Comcast Indiana to request several extensions from the Indiana Broadband Office for various broadband access projects.
An amendment accepted by consent Tuesday represents “a constructive step forward,” said Daniel Miller, president of Indiana’s Broadband and Technology Association.
The package of changes “reflects a thoughtful effort to balance competing interests while addressing the practical realities of broadband deployment,” Miller continued. “It offers a workable framework that promotes continued investment, innovation and expansion, especially in the areas (of Indiana) that need it most.”
The Indiana Energy Association, which represents the state’s “big five” electric utilities and several natural gas utilities, also said the amended legislation “strikes a balance.”

The edits recast proposed alterations weighed last week, when Indiana’s electric cooperatives were dealt a public tongue-lashing over delays in broadband delivery.
“Good Lord willing, this will be the last time we hear of this issue from now until the Second Coming,” said House Utilities Committee leader Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso.
After Soliday’s overhaul, Senate Bill 502 would give telecommunications providers — the attaching entities — and electric utilities that own 300-plus utility poles a 60-day deadline to meet after a government broadband grant contract is executed.
And they’d have four months to reach a project management agreement after the National Telecommunications Information Administration approves the office’s BEAD proposal.
The legislation now sets detailed deadlines for cooperation if they can’t concur. It would also allow the office to set a “rapid response mediation process” when disputes arise — pulling back from hefty fines considered last week. The office would additionally have to publish broadband grant contracts online shortly after they’re executed.
Indiana Chief Broadband Office Stephen Cox said his office is working on the first round of the complex application process and has wrapped up a series of listening sessions.
“Pole attachments are necessary, in most projects, to bring them to completion,” Cox told the committee. “Our office sees this bill as providing a tool to help expedite pole attachment requests … to facilitate project completion.”

Comcast Indiana’s Hart thanked the committee for cutting the timeline for preparatory work, but said that remained the company’s “primary concern.”
“We realize this isn’t Burger King, and we can’t always ‘have it our way,'” she quipped, “but hopefully that is something that we can work on in the future.”
Soliday, however, said such changes “won’t be in the room,” under his leadership.
“We have worked really hard on this (amendment); it was painful,” he said. “And so, I think we’re in a good place where everyone is equally unhappy. So, spread the joy.”
Senate Bill 502 heads to the House floor after the committee’s unanimous, 15-0 vote.
So does an edited small modular nuclear reactor “pilot” program, on a party-line vote.
The committee lifted a two-project cap within Senate Bill 423 so that any interested developers could participate and bring nuclear to Indiana. The legislation would now block program participants from charging ratepayers for no-cost contributions by third parties.
“We’re sort of de-piloting it, but I can change the U.S. Constitution easier than I can change the title of this bill,” Soliday said at least week’s hearing. “… We are taking it out of the pilot realm.”

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)The Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office of Milwaukee released new information Tuesday regarding the arrests of two undocumented immigrants at the county courthouse. 
A spokesperson wrote in an email statement that Edwin Bustamante-Sierre, 27, and Marco Cruz-Garcia, 24, were arrested by ICE at the courthouse. The statement said that Bustamante-Sierre, a citizen of Nicaragua, was arrested on April 3, and convicted in Fond du Lac County for reckless driving on Dec. 5, 2024. He is currently charged with endangering safety, reckless use of a firearm, use of a dangerous weapon and cocaine possession in Milwaukee County, the email statement read. 
Mexican citizen Cruz-Garcia, the spokesperson wrote, was detained by ICE on March 20. The agency’s statement accuses Cruz-Garcia of being a known member of the “Sureños transnational criminal street gang” and states that he’d been arrested for “multiple criminal charges including breaking and entering, car theft, and assault.” The spokesperson wrote that an immigration judge ordered Cruz-Garcia to be deported to Mexico on Feb. 5, 2020.
  The Wisconsin Examiner’s Criminal Justice Reporting Project shines a light on incarceration, law enforcement and criminal justice issues with support from the Public Welfare Foundation.
Wisconsin Examiner was unable to locate an online court record related to Bustamante-Sierre. For Cruz-Garcia, online court records show a case filed on Jan. 18 involving one count of misdemeanor battery with a domestic abuse modifier. The court record shows that on March 9, Cruz-Garcia was in custody and appeared in court via video, where it was noted that he was indigent. Cruz-Garcia’s case was assigned to another judge and he was turned over for supervison to Justice Point, a non-profit organization which provides a variety of evidence-based criminal justice programs.
All Cruz-Garcia’s prior court orders, including a no-contact order and no possession of firearms, remained in place, as he was required to attend all future court proceedings. On March 20, the day he was detained by ICE, Cruz-Garcia appeared in family court where a domestic violence restraining order was dismissed. 
Days later in early April, there was a courtroom discussion about Cruz-Garcia having been deported to Mexico. Rather than dismissing the case, as defense attorneys asked, Circuit Court Judge Marshall Murray (serving as a reserve for Judge Rebecca Kiefer) granted a prosecutor’s request for a warrant to be issued, according to online court records. An order to review the dismissal of the case against Cruz-Garcia 60 days from April 2 was also issued. 
Courthouses are not immune from the Trump administration’s deportation efforts. On Jan. 21, ICE was directed to conduct “civil immigration enforcement actions in or near courthouses when they have credible information that leads them to believe the targeted alien(s) is or will be present at a specific location, and where such action is not precluded by laws imposed by the jurisdiction in which the civil immigration enforcement action will take place.” 
Agents are instructed to conduct enforcement actions “in non-public areas of the courthouse” in collaboration with court security staff, and to use “non-public entrances and exits.” Wherever possible, ICE agents should operate “discreetly to minimize their impact on court proceedings,” the directive states. The order also says ICE agents and officers should avoid actions in or near non-criminal courthouses, such as family or small claims court. 
Last week, the Milwaukee County Sheriff’s Office (MCSO) said in a press statement that it did not participate in the arrests. Although MCSO was aware of the first arrest, the office was not given advance notice of the second arrest. The press release did not name the people who were arrested, and noted that it’s “not uncommon” for law enforcement agencies to search available databases for upcoming court hearings to find targeted individuals.

The courthouse arrests were widely condemned by community members. Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said “an attack on this safe, community-serving space undermines public trust, breeds fear among citizens and staff and disrupts the due process essential to our courts.” Senior staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Wisconsin Tim Muth echoed concerns that the arrests would create an atmosphere of fear around the courthouse. “Research by the ACLU has shown that when ICE is known to be active in courthouses, members of the immigrant community are less likely to report crimes, less likely to cooperate with police and prosecutors and less likely to make their court appearances,” said Muth. “Our communities become less safe as a consequence.” 
Activists from the Milwaukee Alliance Against Racist and Political Repression also expressed concerns about database sharing between local and federal law enforcement, and called for the courthouse to be a safe space for people to come for legal support, services and to seek justice. Over the weekend, at a rally  protesting policies by the Trump administration and Elon Musk, local immigration activists raised those same concerns. “People will be afraid to come to the courthouse if that is not a protected zone,” said Christine Neumann-Ortiz, executive director of Voces de la Frontera during the protest. “And we know that these local fights are our frontline battles.”

Which concepts are so threatening that they need to be banned? Some exist only in fevered imagination. For example, “An individual’s moral character is necessarily determined by his or her race or sex.” Or, for another, “Particular character traits, values, moral or ethical codes, privileges, or beliefs should be ascribed to a race or sex or to an individual because of the individual’s race or sex.” 
Not to be pedantic, but these aren’t concepts; they are propositions. In any case, no one actually teaches such things. It’s as urgent to legislate against these notions as it is to legislate against teaching that the earth is flat, the moon is made of green cheese, and forest fires are caused by Jewish space lasers. Perhaps legislators are confusing ideas that are taken seriously in universities with ideas that have traction on Truth Social.
But to return to hypocrisy: a political party whose members and Dear Leader have pursued electoral success by fomenting social division are now attacking those who advocate for inclusion—or even analyze and teach about it—for supposedly peddling divisive concepts. Even allowing for the usual gap between political rhetoric and reality, this is enough to make one’s head spin.










But to return to hypocrisy: a political party whose members and Dear Leader have pursued electoral success by fomenting social division are now attacking those who advocate for inclusion—or even analyze and teach about it—for supposedly peddling divisive concepts.


Consider a few of the notions that have become standard items in the propaganda toolkit of right-wing Republicans in the last decade, starting with one of Donald Trump’s favorites: undocumented immigrants are rapists, thieves, gangsters, and leeches on the body of America; they are, in Trump’s words, “poisoning the blood” of our country. Perhaps that’s supposed to be a unifying idea. It did, after all, work with some audiences in 1930s Germany.
Demonizing immigrants is just a warm-up. Right-wing Republicans have targeted a host of other groups as enemies. Trump has called the press “the enemy of the people.” His vice-president, J. D. Vance, has called universities and professors “the enemy.” Trump has called protesters “the enemy within,” threatening to use military force against them. During the height of the Covid pandemic, Trump accused medical researchers who found that hydroxychloroquine was ineffective against Covid of issuing a “Trump enemy statement.” 
If North Carolina Republicans haven’t said precisely the same things, neither have they stood up to denounce the divisive statements of their party leader. They’re not likely to, of course, because they employ similar strategies of vilifying LGBTQ people, “woke elites,” doomsaying scientists, public employees, and anyone who has ever relied on our society’s flimsy social safety net. If not for dividing and conquering, they’d have no strategy at all.  
It’s not hard to understand why right-wing Republicans see journalists, scientists, and professors as enemies. These groups are professionally and ethically committed to what is anathema to Trump and his acolytes everywhere: uncovering and telling the truth. When the truth does not accord with the self-serving myths of authoritarians, they try to stifle those who tell it. Taking over the institutions—the press, universities, government research agencies—that support truth-telling is part of the process. It’s an old playbook.
With SB 558, Republican legislators are trying not only to dominate public universities from the outside—as they already do by appointing their backers to the UNC System Board of Governors and controlling the state’s purse strings—but to reach into the classroom and quash academic freedom.
For example, one of SB 558’s forbidden propositions is this: “The rule of law does not exist but instead is a series of power relationships and struggles among racial or other groups.” Put in such simplistic terms, this is not a proposition any college-level instructor is likely to take seriously. But suppose it were rephrased, like so: “The law is made, interpreted, and enforced in ways that reflect inequalities in wealth and power among groups in society, and is often used to reinforce those inequalities.” That’s a proposition for which evidence abounds, and one that deserves serious consideration in a class that deals with such matters.
The problem, however, with SB 588 is that discussion of serious propositions—the rephrased version above—will be chilled and quite possibly never happen. Instructors might rightly fear that some students, disturbed by a challenging idea and emboldened by a foolish law, will bring complaints. Instructors might also fear administrators who are eager to over-comply and issue directives to avoid potentially troubling topics and course content. This isn’t paranoid speculation; it’s already happening in some places.
Another off-limits proposition is that “a meritocracy is inherently racist or sexist.” Again, without nuance or qualification, this is not a proposition professors are likely to use to spark classroom discussion (presuming a course where such a proposition is germane). Yet there is an important idea here, one that would get lost under the corrosive force of SB 588. 
The idea, rephrased as a question, is this: Can what look like meritocratic criteria to members of dominant groups mask biases that advantage members of those groups? Plenty of evidence can be brought to bear on this question, and no place that calls itself a university should be inhibited, to any degree, from tackling the question and examining the relevant evidence. But that’s exactly what SB 558 will do. And it’s not just an abstract notion of academic freedom that will suffer; the damage will be to students and the quality of their education.
Defenders of SB 558 might point to its third “whereas,” which claims that the General Assembly is “committed to ensuring that all North Carolina students enrolled in public institutions of higher education receive a meaningful education based on academic excellence, critical thinking, and the free exchange of ideas.” That would be nice if it were true. But it’s impossible to have it both ways. To say, You can think critically and freely exchange ideas—but here’s a list of ideas you can’t freely exchange or use to think critically, is classic Orwellian doublespeak.
If North Carolina’s Republican state legislators really wanted to take a stand against divisive ideas, there are, in addition to those I noted earlier, plenty to choose from. They could reject the idea, now embraced by the Trump administration, that the First Amendment doesn’t apply to non-citizens legally present in the United States. They could reject the ideas that all Jews are Zionists and that criticism of Israel is antisemitic. They could reject the idea that we can’t have, say, national health insurance because it would mean tax dollars going to undeserving others. These fallacious ideas are enormously divisive, far more so than any at which Republican legislators have taken aim.      
I don’t expect right-wing Republicans to look in the mirror and reform themselves any time soon. In a nation as fraught with inequalities as the United States, the divide-and-conquer strategy has proven too useful to abandon. But the rest of us don’t have to keep falling for it. Everyone who hopes to see our public universities survive as institutions of truth-seeking based on evidence and rigorous analysis should resist. There is an urgent need to change the hands on the levers of power before more damage is done.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/NC_Legislature_PhotoChenkel-1024x720.jpg,,,2025-04-09 07:00:14.451130

(Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune)This story originally appeared in Stateline.
Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
 Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
 State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
On Monday health officials announced that Colorado’s second case of measles in was confirmed in an infant in Denver. They warned people who visited the Denver Health emergency room on Sunday that they might have been exposed.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Anti-abortion politicians aren’t just chipping away at reproductive rights; they’re serving as the testing ground for a nationwide ban, even as President Donald Trump insists, they’re leaving it “up to the states.”


Idaho is the latest state to escalate attacks on abortion care, moving to classify mifepristone as a ‘controlled dangerous substance’ — a move mirroring the dangerous legislation in Texas and Louisiana. Meanwhile, lawmakers in those states have pursued criminal charges against a New York doctor for prescribing abortion medication, signaling their intent to prosecute under extreme state laws.


The attack on medication abortion isn’t just intensifying — it’s reaching a crisis point. Anti-abortion politicians are weaponizing junk science and misinformation to target providers and dismantle access state by state. Their playbook is clear: restrict, block and criminalize.


But here’s the thing, we know leaving it “up to the states” creates an unstable patchwork of care that ultimately means people who need abortion care, will go without. Trump’s administration and his appointees continue to attempt to distort science, and manufacture doubt in a perfectly safe form of health care. 


The threat to medication abortion is real, and the consequences are deadly. This fight is no longer about restoring the rights lost with Roe — it’s about ensuring people across all 50 states can access the care they need before it’s too late. 


Medication abortion, which accounts for 63% of all abortions in the United States, has been FDA-approved for over two decades. It involves the use of two medications — mifepristone and misoprostol — and a 25-year track record shows it is one of the safest and most effective medical interventions available. 
It has also revolutionized access to abortion care because patients can consult with a health care provider using telehealth and pick up the pills at a nearby pharmacy or have them delivered to their home. This model of care is not only more affordable but also aligns with the broader trend of patient-centered health care, making essential services accessible to more people regardless of their location or income level.
Studies demonstrate the safety and patient satisfaction with virtual visits, so it is not surprising that this model now makes up 20% of all abortion care.   


That is why anti-abortion lawmakers and opponents are waging a full-scale assault on this critical form of care, leveraging outdated stereotypes, misinformation and antiquated laws to severely limit — or even eliminate — access. 


The consequences of restricting access to medication abortion care are devastating and undeniable. We sit with the heartbreaking stories of Amber Thurman, Porsha Ngumezi, Josseli Barnica and Candi Miller, reported by ProPublica. These women were denied necessary care during early pregnancy loss because of abortion bans. 
Their tragedies highlight the real-world stakes when people cannot access the medical care they need. This isn’t just about the stories of individual women — it’s a cautionary tale for all of us. Denying access to medication abortion care doesn’t just force people to travel across state lines; it can cost them their lives. 


Trump and others have said they will leave abortion rights “up to the states,” but the idea that this is a safe or workable option is a mirage. It ignores the deeply inequitable access to care that state-by-state decision-making perpetuates. 
Lawmakers in Louisiana have established a system that subjects every prescription written for mifepristone and misoprostol to individual scrutiny, thus delaying — or sometimes even denying — access to a medication that is used to manage an early miscarriage, insert an IUD, or start labor for childbirth.  
In Texas, lawmakers have made clear their willingness to criminally charge providers, who prescribe medication abortion via telehealth appointments to people in Texas. Make no mistake, this lawsuit is a direct attempt to chill the willingness of providers in states where abortion is legal to provide care to patients in states where abortion care is unavailable.   


At the federal level, anti-abortion lawmakers are trying to revive the Comstock Act, an outdated 19th-century law designed to restrict the mailing of “obscene” materials. In late December, the U.S. Postal Service affirmed that mifepristone and misoprostol can be mailed legally but left the door open if the Trump administration seeks to twist Comstock into a tool for blocking access to medication abortion.  


This is a clear signal: anti-choice politicians, judges and lobbyists are determined to weaponize every legal and procedural avenue to deny care.  


The stakes couldn’t be higher. To preserve and build back real access to abortion, we cannot afford a puzzle piece of state laws and entanglement of stigma and misinformation. We must focus on the immediate, tangible needs of people today. 
That means ensuring access to mifepristone and misoprostol within all 50 states, decriminalizing pregnancy care, and guaranteeing that people receive the emergency care they need without fear of prosecution. Shield laws —designed to protect providers willing to provide care to people across state lines — are essential, but they are not enough. We need federal protections that ensure access to FDA-approved medication nationwide, not a state-by-state patchwork system established by anti-choice judges and politicians. 


The consequences of inaction are dire. Access to medication abortion care is under relentless attack, and lives are hanging in the balance. This isn’t just about restoring the past; it’s about protecting the future of reproductive health care for generations to come. We must act now with urgency and determination to secure access to this critical care for everyone, no matter what state they live in.

House Speaker Destin Hall said the bill sponsor wanted time to consider amendments to House bill 171.
It prohibits schools and state and local governments from maintaining DEI offices or programs. Diversity and equity could not be considered in awarding contracts. It bans diversity training.
Employees would face civil fines of up to $10,000 for infractions and could be sued for alleged violations. 
After Tuesday’s House session, House Democratic leader Robert Reives (D-Chatham) said he hoped the bill would not reappear. 
“I’m hoping that we recognize that this isn’t the kind of thing we need to be concentrating on right now,” he said. “I don’t see any purpose that is served by this bill. I think the House has done an exceptionally good job this year of not getting into these kinds of issues.”
Legislation on DEI and other divisive topics are a distraction from the issue of economic well-being for state residents that should be the legislature’s focus, Reives said. 
“There’s one clear question that everybody has: Why do I have to work two or three jobs to get the same thing my parents did with one job? We keep trying to find ways to keep people distracted from that, and we’ve got to stop that.”

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)When Ellie O’Keefe moved to Oak Hill in Fayette County, West Virginia, she was surprised how difficult it was to find child care.
“I was very surprised, coming from a much more suburban area, to be faced by this lack of child care,” she said.
More than 25,000 children in West Virginia don’t have access to child care, and more than 150 child care providers have closed their classrooms over the last year. There are also concerns about the state’s long-term plan to fund its subsidy program that helps working parents pay for child care. 
Parents, child care workers, the state’s business leaders and some Republican and Democrat lawmakers have asked for bills and funding to address widespread issues. 
Another legislative session is likely to end with no movement on the issue.
“Well, none of our bills made it through, so I think that says a lot about priorities,” said Pamela Shope, site director for Playmates Preschools and Child Development Centers, which operates six centers in Cabell and Wayne counties. 
O’Keefe, pregnant with her second child, stood in the lower rotunda of the state Capitol on Tuesday for Child Care Day. A sticker on her T-shirt said, “I am a child care voter.”
“Families are really struggling in ways they haven’t in the past,” she said. “It is another year where we’ve been told that this was going to be a priority, and nothing has really shifted.”
It feels like déjà vu for those hoping for changes after last year the Republican-led legislature failed to send a stack of child care-focused bills to the governor’s desk for consideration. Lawmakers, at former Gov. Jim Justice’s urging, did approve a Child Care Tax Credit in 2024, and it’s available to families who already claim the federal child care tax credit.
“I’m disappointed,” said Del. Kathie Hess Crouse, R-Putnam, who sponsored several child care measures. She said the House of Delegates’ focus on budget constraints had partially held up the measures. “It’s not over till midnight on Saturday, so there’s always hope, but I won’t be surprised if nothing happens.”
West Virginia has the nation’s lowest rate of women serving in a legislature, which Crouse believes has impacted the House’s action on child care.
“Unfortunately, the majority of the body are men, and they don’t have to deal with these issues,” said Crouse, a mother who chose to leave the workforce to stay home with her children. “I’m not saying they don’t care about them. I just don’t think they have the same pull and realize what it takes and what’s needed.” 
Del. Kayla Young, D-Kanawha, is a mom of two and at one time was the only mother of young children serving in the House. She has championed child care legislation during the last few years. 
“I don’t think we have any women who are chairs of major committees in the House, and it’s obviously not a priority of this super majority,” Young said. 
“Feels like another year with all the same excuses,” she continued. “We still haven’t done anything for child care.”

Child care measures stalled in session’s final week  
The West Virginia Chamber of Commerce has backed child care measures, saying it’s necessary to improve the state’s abysmal workforce participation rate. Others pushing for child care expansion point to the importance of early childhood learning and resources in a state with a high rate of poverty and babies impacted by the substance abuse crisis.
There were a number of child care measures introduced this year, particularly in the House.
House Bill 2731, sponsored by Crouse, would create the Employee Child Care Assistance Partnership, where the state would partner with child care employers to offset their employees’ child care costs. The program is meant to help centers retain workers and keep classrooms open. 
Shope said the measure would have “a huge impact to help retain staff.”
The average annual cost of care at a licensed child care center in West Virginia is more than $6,000 per child. 
“Child care is very expensive, and we do give our teachers and staff employee discounts … but it’s still very hard,” Shope said, adding that employees at her centers can make too much to qualify for the state’s child care subsidy program. 
“We want to have the highest quality child care that we can provide for our families, and sometimes it’s difficult to find a good, qualified teacher that wants to work in child care. We need all of the benefits that we can to get them to stay,” she said. 
The bill remains parked in the House Health Committee with the legislative session set to adjourn Saturday.
Crouse also introduced legislation, House Bill 2730, to establish a pilot program where the state, an employer and an employee each pay one-third of total child care costs. It’s known as a “tri-share model” for child care. The program is currently being piloted in eight counties. The bill, which would have cost roughly $10 million, is unlikely to make it to the full House of Delegates for consideration.
Del. Bob Fehrenbacher, R-Wood, who serves on the House Finance Committee, said there wasn’t one single thing that had derailed child care measures this session. 
“I do think there are some tax considerations, you know, with the structural deficit, but there are some of the options that I think would be OK. Let’s get started on this,” he said. “Yes, there may be some tax implications, but there also ought to be some benefits, such as more people being in the workforce.” 
Fehrenbacher sponsored multiple bills aimed at tackling the state’s child care issues, including a measure that would increase the tax credit for employers providing child care for employees. His child care bills weren’t considered by House committees.
“Frankly, I’m disappointed,” he said.

Long-term funding for child care 
While the House budget increases funding for child care in fiscal year 2026, Young is concerned that the state’s subsidy program is facing a July 1 funding cliff, which she said could result in thousands of children being removed from the program. During House budget negotiations last week, she tried to amend the budget bill to include around $32 million for the child care subsidy program. The House voted down her amendment.
“[It] means we’ll have more parents out of the workforce. It means we’ll have more centers closing,” Young said. 
Fehrenbacher said testimony from Department of Human Services Secretary Alex Mayer led him to believe the program will be funded throughout the year, but there’s still a question mark about the long-term funding amid the state’s child care issues. 
“We need other options. So, things like the tax incentives for an employer or the tri-share model are things that are out there that I think could have helped give us options,” he said. 
O’Keefe hopes the state will work to address the affordability of child care.
“We’re looking for the best opportunities for our children. We’re looking for the freedom to be able to go to work,” she said. 
“Just because you don’t see these parents coming to the Capitol doesn’t mean that they don’t want to speak up … They often are not able to come to this stage because they’re working and because they have child care,” O’Keefe continued. “Their voices deserve to be heard.”

Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro, prepares to present Senate Bill 520 to his fellow senators on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas senators on Tuesday approved a proposed ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) “offices, officers, policies or practices” in local government entities.
Senate Bill 520 would prohibit local governments from promoting:

“Preferences based upon race, color, sex, ethnicity, or national origin;
Differential treatment on the basis of race, color, sex, ethnicity, or national origin; or
Political or social activism to consider race, color, sex, ethnicity, or national origin as factors in decision-making, except when required by federal or state law.”

The bill would allow Arkansans to sue local governments for injunctive relief if the government does not cease violating the mandate within 30 days of being notified.
Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Jonesboro is the lead sponsor of SB 520 and earlier this year sponsored Act 116 of 2025. The law repealed requirements that state procurement proposals include language that encourages minority participation or to adopt an equal opportunity hiring program designed to increase the percentage of minority employees.
Sullivan claimed Act 116 would force public entities to prioritize “merit” over “preferential treatment” in contracting and hiring practices.
The language of SB 520 aligns both with Act 116 and with Arkansas ACCESS, a higher education overhaul bill approved in March, Sullivan told the Senate City, County and Local Affairs Committee on Tuesday morning. ACCESS prohibits institutions of higher education from “comply[ing] with any institutional accreditation requirement related to DEI.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sullivan told both the committee and the full Senate that Arkansas should align itself with the federal government’s stance on DEI. President Donald Trump’s January executive order declared an end to all DEI “mandates, policies, programs, preferences, and activities” in federal agencies.
Arnessa Bennett, North Little Rock’s DEI officer, told the committee that she and the city oppose SB 520. She said it would discourage local governments from holding events in partnership with organizations that have DEI policies.
“We feel like you’re violating our First Amendment rights in telling us that we cannot say anything about DEI,” Bennett said. “…It’s almost like we’re being censored.”
The all-Republican committee passed the bill with no audible dissent. The committee also approved the addition of an amendment to the bill, stating: “This section does not prevent compliance with any state or federal civil rights laws or any agreement related to the receipt of state or federal funding.”
Bills usually are not heard by the full House or Senate until at least a day after passing committees, but Sullivan asked the Senate to suspend the rules so SB 520 could receive a vote Tuesday evening.
Twenty-two of the 29 Republican senators voted for SB 520. Senate President Pro Tempore Bart Hester, R-Cave Springs, joined the six Senate Democrats in voting against the bill. GOP Sens. Tyler Dees of Siloam Springs and Jim Petty of Van Buren voted present, and four more Republicans did not vote.
Sen. Reginald Murdock, D-Marianna, was the only senator to speak on the bill before the vote. He also spoke against Act 116 in January, and he said Tuesday that the state should not “bring this craziness all the way to the local level.”
“Let’s allow local control to make their decisions on how they want to deal with their communities,” Murdock said.

The river is now forecast to crest in Cairo, Illinois at up to 54 feet on April 10 — just over major flood stage — according to the National Weather Service. The river could stay above 50 feet for about two weeks, Lower Mississippi River Forecast Center senior hydrologist David Welch said Monday.
The rain has stopped for now, but the basin is not yet out of danger. In Northwest Tennessee, Dyer County issued a mandatory evacuation order Monday for Bogota and surrounding communities due to the “imminent threat of flooding.” More than 100 residents of West Memphis, Arkansas, had been rescued from their homes as of Sunday.
Officials in Memphis and Cape Girardeau, Missouri, are closely monitoring the rising water after already suffering damage from several days of flash floods. Arkansas, Kentucky and Tennessee have active federal disaster declarations after tornadoes, high winds, and heavy rain in early April, according to FEMA. Kentucky and Missouri also have disaster declarations for previous storms over the past few months.

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is in flood fight mode, which allows them to provide equipment and assistance to local authorities, said Drew Smith of the Corps’ Mississippi Valley Division. Multiple tributaries of the Mississippi River in the Memphis District saw “unprecedented rainfall,” including the St. Francis/Little River basin and the Obion, Forked Deer and Loosahatchie rivers, Smith said.
“After three years of drought along the mighty Mississippi, and no substantial high water along our river since April of 2023, what we’ve seen in the last week or so has been torrential rain impacts of much of the lower main stem,” Blytheville, Arkansas, Mayor Melisa Logan said during a Monday news conference hosted by the Mississippi River Cities and Towns Initiative.
Logan is the Arkansas state chair of the nonprofit organization, which represents local leaders in flood-prone cities and towns along the river, and has been lobbying in Washington, D.C. for more funding for flood control projects. 
MRCTI executive director Colin Wellenkamp said the organization has multiple flood mitigation projects that have created 100,000 new acres of natural flood storage underway from La Crosse, Wisconsin down to Louisiana. Some of those projects helped absorb floodwaters — and risk — during this event, he said.
Cities in Missouri, Tennessee report significant damage
Northwest Arkansas received rainfall in the double digits between April 2 and April 5, Logan said. Her region saw some flooding, but fared better than other cities along the river. 
Memphis Mayor Paul Young said the city received 12 inches of rain, causing flooding, downed trees and power outages.
“Thankfully, our teams worked really hard, and they were very responsive and very prepared for the storms that took place,” he said. “When you have that level of rainfall, it’s hard for our systems to be able to drain the water at a speed that is necessary.”
Cape Girardeau, Missouri, and several small towns in Cape County suffered significant damage from flooding and at least one tornado, Mayor Stacy Kinder said.
The Big Muddy River, a tributary of the Mississippi River running through Southern Illinois, is seeing its highest flood levels in years. Cape Girardeau has opened up green space over the last several years to create natural flood storage areas to the north of the city, Kinder said.
While those projects have helped retain some of the floodwater, Cape Girardeau’s water treatment system can’t keep up. The system typically treats around 26 million gallons over the span of a few days. Between April 2 and April 6, it treated 91 million gallons, Kinder said.
The excessive volume caused a 24-inch sewer main to break near the river’s edge, and repairs are on hold until the sewer system can begin to drain.

“We have managed to mitigate leakage as long as our lift station remains operational, so prayers and cross fingers on that,” Kinder said. “We’re hoping that the impacts are not too tremendous there, but it’s a big deal.”
The city has closed its Mississippi River floodgates in anticipation of a 37-foot flood stage, and city pump stations will be continuously manned to continue moving water out of downtown, she said.
Mitigation measures softened the blow for some towns
Mayor Nick White of New Madrid, Missouri, said his community saw over a foot of rain in  some areas, and flooding caused some power outages and sewer issues. The city used its  gravity drains – pipes or drains that use gravity to direct water down slopes and away from structures – early in the flood event and filled 50,000 sandbags out over five days, White said. Minimal homes were flooded. 
“It could have been a lot worse and I’m thankful for the outcome that we’ve had thus far,” White said.
The river is expected to reach 41.5 feet at its peak; flood stage for New Madrid is 34 feet.
In Osceola, Arkansas, Mayor Joe Harris Jr. reported “minimal damage.” The city had been working on storm drain improvements for the past three months, “and we just happened to get ahead of the curve,” he said.
Tiptonville, Tennessee closed its flood gates Monday morning, Mayor Cliff Berry said. The town has experienced minimal damage so far, but nearby Obion County was not so lucky. Rives, a small town that suffered significant flooding in February, is once again filled with water, he said.
Horseshoe Lake in East St. Louis, Illinois, took on about 500 Olympic swimming pools worth of water, protecting five cities in the area, Wellenkamp said. At the confluence of the Illinois and Mississippi Rivers, a flood storage project that is not yet complete still took on some water, diverting it from Grafton, Illinois and Alton, Missouri.
Flood reduction structures along the Big Muddy River are helping slow and store flood water that would otherwise run through Cape Girardeau, Wellenkamp said. A new forest being built in West Memphis should take pressure off of roadways and North Memphis flooding, he said.
“All of this adds capacity and it reduces overall risk, and it creates a situation that would be less impactful than otherwise,” Wellenkamp said. “We’re happy to report that these projects, even though some of them are in progress, are working and doing what they’re designed to do.”

Kennedy Jr. attended funeral services April 6 for Daisy Hildebrand, 8, the second Texas child to die from the measles this year. Measles cases are on track to reach a 34-year high as vaccine hesitancy spreads and funding cuts imperil state responses. (Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune)Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.











Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health



Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

(Photo credit: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)State lawmakers will consider a proposal this spring to let the governor add two at-large members to the Louisiana Public Service Commission, requiring voters to give up power they currently have to elect all members of one of the state’s most powerful political institutions.  
House Bill 364, sponsored by Rep. Daryl Deshotel, R-Marksville, is a proposed constitutional amendment to allow the governor to hand select two additional members to the commission that regulates utilities in Louisiana. The body is currently composed of five members, each elected from their respective multi-parish districts.    
The two gubernatorial appointees would be able to serve two consecutive four-year terms. The five elected commissioners are currently limited to three consecutive six-year terms. 
The five LPSC districts are larger and more populous than Louisiana’s six congressional districts, giving the commissioners significant influence on matters of everyday concern to a large number of residents, though any at-large commissioners would have far greater influence than the current five.  
The commission determines how much utilities can charge their customers for their services that include electricity, water, gas, cable television, phone and internet service. A utility provider needs LPSC approval before raising rates or adding any kinds of fees to customers’ bills.  
The most important election in Louisiana that many don’t even know about

The commission oversees major investor-owned utilities such as Cleco and Entergy Louisiana, as well as smaller, member-owned power cooperatives such as DEMCO. Its regulatory umbrella covers the entire state, save for a handful of city-owned utilities and private service providers in New Orleans and other cities, which fall under the jurisdiction of local governments. 
LPSC members also have oversight of intrastate oil pipelines, tow truck services and moving companies. Each commissioner is supposed to represent constituents in their districts in any disputes they have with utility companies. 
“It only takes three members to control rates over the entire state,” Deshotel said, referring to the three-vote majority needed for a measure to pass on the five-member panel. “I just think we need more representation.”
Some are skeptical of the proposal. 
Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan, a Republican and former state senator from Lafayette, said he has great respect for the legislative process and his former colleague but doesn’t think the addition of two appointed members would accomplish Deshotel’s stated intention of increasing representation. 
“They wouldn’t be answerable to a constituency, so it kinda defeats the purpose of his goal,” Coussan said. “I don’t see how two appointees who only answer to the governor would accomplish that.”
Coussan said Deshotel’s proposal would drastically overhaul an institution that works with companies and residents through regulatory processes that have been relatively consistent over the years. Such changes would send a discouraging message to the major stakeholders investing in Louisiana who are familiar with and rely on the LPSC’s stable regulatory environment, he added.
Commissioner Davante Lewis, D-Baton Rouge, questioned Dehotel’s motives, saying the governor is the only person who would gain representation and power under the proposal.
“It truly dilutes the people’s will by reducing their vote,” Lewis said. “If it was truly about representation, wouldn’t he just make the districts smaller by adding [elected] members?”
Louisiana’s largest industries tired of waiting for renewable energy

During the most recent round of redistricting in 2022, the legislature chose to keep the number of LPSC members at five. There were no proposals to add elected members to the commission, but there were some that sought to redraw the map to include a second majority-Black district. Lawmakers ultimately rejected those measures.
Deshotel said adding appointed rather than elected members would keep out the vast amounts of campaign cash that special interests have used to influence LPSC elections, though he hedged his statement by saying he doesn’t think that it has affected any of the current commissioners.
“These are extremely expensive elections, and most of the donations come from the same people that they’re regulating,” Deshotel said.
He added that he plans to file a campaign finance reform bill targeting LSPC elections in the future if his constitutional amendment stalls at the Capitol this year. 
Constitutional amendments require two-thirds support from each chamber of the legislature and final approval from Louisiana voters during a statewide election. The 2025 legislative session starts Monday.

Thousands of Michigan children could lose free meals under proposed cuts by congressional Republicans that would make it more difficult for schools to provide universal free meals, according to state officials.
GOP lawmakers want to change an existing federal program that makes subsidized meal programs more efficient and accessible by allowing schools in impoverished communities to qualify to offer free meals to all students, as opposed to independently verifying each student’s family income.
Currently, schools must show 25% of their students are enrolled in other aid programs like the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program to qualify for community eligibility. House Republicans want to raise the requirement to 60% of students.
Republicans say they want to make the change to ensure only the neediest students get free school meals. The cuts to the program were raised by the House Budget Committee Chair U.S. Rep. Jodey Arrington last month.
The proposals would save $12 billion over a decade, according to a list circulated by Arrington. An official federal budget has not been proposed yet.
The nearly 600,000 Michigan students who currently qualify through the current federal community eligibility program could lose access to free school meals, according to the Michigan Department of Education.
The actual number of students who would lose free school meals would likely be lower because some schools would still qualify for community eligibility under the proposed new guidance. Some students also qualify for other aid programs.
Over the last few years, Michigan has provided free school meals to all students, allocating around $200 million in state funds annually to bridge the gap in federal programs. Proposed legislation to make universal free school meals permanent in the state failed to move forward.
Overall, more than 850,000 Michigan children rely on free public school lunches and more than 474,000 eat breakfast in school.
If the proposed federal cuts were to become law, many students in the state would be negatively impacted, officials from the MDE said Tuesday during a presentation to the State Board of Education. It could also lead to schools serving lower quality, less nutritious meals to students due to budget constraints.
“The health of our Michigan students is at risk,” said Diane Golzynski, deputy superintendent for business, health, and library services for the MDE, during the board meeting.
Additionally, Republicans want to change federal regulations to allow local schools just 10 days after they receive a completed application to determine if a family is eligible for free or reduced meals.
The law currently only requires schools to get income verification for 3% of the applications it receives. The proposed changes would make schools verify the incomes of all families who apply.
“Imagine how a district would be able to take on this monumental task in that very short, federally regulated time frame of 10 days,” said Deanne Kelleher, director of the MDE’s Office of Health and Nutrition Services, during the board meeting.
There is also concern families may not apply if they are asked to provide personal information every school year, given data security concerns, she added.
Fewer families applying for free meals will negatively affect the amount of federal Title I and state at-risk funding schools receive, Kelleher said.
Proposed plans would also end summer feeding programs, which provide food for students and families. In 2024, the programs helped feed 3.9 million Michigan households.
“This proposal could continue to contribute to the rise in food insecurity for households with children,” said Kelleher.
One in six Michigan children face food insecurity, according to the nonprofit Feeding America.
Dawn Pully, food service director for Bendle Public Schools, where 88% of students are from impoverished families, said during the meeting the only meals some children eat are provided by their schools.
“I don’t even want to think about telling our students that they have to pay or that they can’t eat because they owe money,” she said.
Making the federal program more restrictive will have two major consequences, Pulley said.
“Parents, for sure, will not follow the correct steps to be approved, which will punish the student,” she said.
School nutrition staff also will be forced to spend many more hours completing paperwork, taking away from time they spend focusing on creating healthy menu options for students.
Universal free school meals can boost attendance, increase test scores, and decrease suspensions, research shows.
Richard Browder, director of student nutrition for Brighton Public Schools, said during the meeting he’s seen the positive impact universal free school meals programs have had on students.
“I’ve watched students who used to come in late now arrive early for breakfast every single morning,” he said. “I’ve seen high schoolers who used to skip lunch because they didn’t want to be singled out for free meals now eating with their peers with pride, because every student gets the same meal, no stigma attached.”
Michigan students also were impacted by the abrupt cut of $30 million in grants to programs that helped schools buy food from local farms.
Additionally, 118 truckloads of food were canceled for a federal food assistance program the MDE administers, said Golzynski.
Tiffany Tilley, a member of the board, said during the meeting the cuts and the proposed changes to the federal meal program are “an absolute travesty.”
Board President Pamela Pugh said the cuts are “cruel” and “callous.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A Montgomery County group filed a formal complaint with the Tennessee Ethics Commission against state Rep. Aron Maberry, saying he has a conflict of interest as a state House and local school board member.
The group says Maberry, a Clarksville Republican, should resign from the Clarksville Montgomery County School Board, mainly because of his votes in support of state legislation that could discriminate against immigrant students. The complaint, which was filed April 3, bases its argument on Maberry’s vote for House Bill 793, which allows school districts and charter schools to refuse to enroll students without permanent legal documentation, contradicting a 1982 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that guarantees all children access to public education.
“By supporting this bill, Mr. Maberry has violated the School Board Code of Ethics, specifically his duty to provide equal education opportunities and to refrain from using his position for partisan gain,” the complaint says.
The group, which includes current and former educators, Catherine Garrigan, Joy Rice, Karen Reynolds, Katherine Lawson and Jeri Hiley-Britain, says in the filing the bill could violate federal laws prohibiting discrimination based on race, color or national origin and risks losing $1.1 billion in federal education funding for Tennessee.
The filing alleges several ethics violations against the first-term representative of House District 68, including failure to uphold student rights and represent the entire school community, allowing partisan influence to affect his votes, undermining diversity, equity and inclusion, as well as failure to prioritize student needs.
Maberry, who voted Monday in favor of the bill restricting immigrant student enrollment, issued a statement saying, “This complaint is without merit and clearly politically motivated. It’s a desperate stunt by woke local leftists who reject the conservative values our community holds dear and that I proudly represent at the Capitol. They are obsessed with overturning the will of the people; all of their previous attempts have failed. I have been fully transparent about my service on the school board and my intention to serve out the remainder of my term. I have full confidence in the Ethics Commission and trust the facts will lead to an appropriate course of action.”
Monday’s meeting of the House Government Operations Committee was interrupted by ministers who recited the Lord’s Prayer in protest of the bill, which passed 8-7.
The issue has roiled the legislature all year, leading opponents to rally against multiple Senate and House committee votes.
The Senate version of the bill sponsored by Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson, chairman of the finance committee, would require school districts to check the immigration status of students and charge them tuition to enroll. The House bill sponsored by House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland would give districts the option to check immigration status.
Lawmakers have said they want to pass the measure to challenge Plyler v. Doe at the Supreme Court level, the 43-year-old ruling that requires school districts to serve all students.

The House Judiciary Committee opted Tuesday to postpone legislation until 2026 enabling Bayer/Monsanto to avoid liability in lawsuits connected to cancer claims. Republican Rep. Clay Doggett of Pulaski called for the delay less than a week after the full Senate passed its version of the bill.
“I felt like there was a lot of stakeholders, there was a lot of questions that we had that didn’t get answered,” Doggett said Tuesday.
Tennessee bill would expand weed-killer manufacturers’ legal immunity 

Germany-based Bayer, the parent company of Monsanto, recently agreed to pay nearly $2.1 billion to a man who claimed he contracted non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma from Roundup. Some 170,000 similar lawsuits have been filed against the chemical company.
Under the legislation, though, as long as a pesticide manufacturer’s federally-approved label doesn’t warn of a disease, they couldn’t be held liable for causing an illness. 
Farmers in his rural Middle Tennessee district supported the bill, Doggett said. Yet lawmakers were overwhelmed with information about the bill, making it difficult to bring it to a vote this year, he said.
For instance, Republican Rep. Gino Bulso, a Brentwood attorney, told lawmakers a provision in state law gives people standing to sue in federal court. Doggett also added that he favors an amendment to the measure that dropped a “blanket immunity” provision for the companies involved. 
Doggett conceded that farmers could be “more prone” to contract illnesses from spraying the pesticide/herbicide. Yet he said farmers in his district support the legislation and use of the chemical, and he added that other lawmakers said foreign countries will continue using the product on their crops even if it vanishes in America.
Farmers and the Farm Bureau testified previously that the Roundup used in modern agriculture enables no-till farming on larger tracts, which is considered a more efficient method.
The House bill’s sponsor, Republican Rep. Rusty Grills of Newbern in West Tennessee, called the outcome “part of the legislative process.”

“There’s lots of questions people have that they didn’t feel like they got adequate answers to, so knowing that, we’re at the end of the session now, so there’s not a whole lot of time to get answers,” Grills said.
The bill can be brought back for consideration in 2026 since it wasn’t voted down.
Critics have said they believe it gives Bayer and Monsanto blanket immunity to lawsuits. 
But Grills said rather than a giveaway to the company, the legislation would put an end to frivolous lawsuits and stave off a day when farmers can’t use preferred products because of the threat of legal action against manufacturers.
“I’m one of those farmers. We use these products, and because we use those products, we’re able to make a living,” Grills said.
A Tennessee Farm Bureau lobbyist testified recently that the Senate bill would avert only cases involving product labels approved by the Environmental Protection Agency.
Opponents of the legislation say it will remove people’s constitutional rights to a jury trial when they’re diagnosed with deadly illnesses caused by the product.
Legislatures in Iowa, Missouri, Idaho, Wyoming and Mississippi have turned down similar bills, yet Bayer-Monsanto hasn’t pulled products from shelves, leaving opponents to say the chemical maker is more concerned with increasing earnings than protecting people.
The Tennessee Trial Lawyers Association testified in the Senate that opponents don’t believe the products should be banned, only that customers should maintain their right to take legal action.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)Union nurses at UnityPoint Health-Meriter hospital in Madison rallied Tuesday, warning that they would strike if they can’t reach a satisfactory labor agreement in their current contract talks.
The rally was held in advance of a bargaining session scheduled for Wednesday between the hospital and the Service Employees International Union (SEIU), which represents about 800 nurses at the hospital.
The nurses are currently working without a contract after their previous agreement expired March 16 and was extended to March 23.
The union is highlighting its demands for written language addressing safety issues, said Pat Raes, SEIU Wisconsin president and a nurse for 35 years at Meriter.
“We are fighting for the safety of every last person there. And part of that in today’s society when rules are being turned upside down, inside out, and backwards, means that we have to find ways to make sure that our safety is codified,” Raes said at the Tuesday afternoon rally. “And one of those ways to do that is with having a contract that talks about safety.”
Sherry Casali, chief nursing executive and vice president of patient care at the hospital, said in a statement Tuesday that the hospital management is “committed to working with SEIU WI to address their concerns through a fair contract that both parties can support.”
The statement said the hospital has implemented a number of safety and security measures and has competitive salaries for nurses.
 Raes said the hospital has safety plans, but that nurses want those plans to go farther, including being enshrined in the labor agreement. She said the union wants to see guaranteed staffing ratios in the name of patient safety as well.
“We are preparing if needed to move forward to a strike,” Raes said. “These nurses are ready to strike. Let me tell you — they are not afraid. But we do not want to strike if we don’t have to.”
To date, the union has not issued a formal strike notice.

(Getty Images)As someone who has lived through the West Virginia foster care system from the inside — not as a policymaker, but as a foster and pre-adoptive parent — I read Jaycie Bias’ recent comments in West Virginia Watch with a heavy heart.
In the April 3 article covering the proposed $30 million budget cut to foster care, Ms. Bias, Executive Director of the WV Foster, Adoptive & Kinship Parents Network, was quoted saying:
“Funding isn’t the issue… The state is doing so little for us in terms of follow through that you are having people fall through the cracks.”
I appreciate her service and understand her frustration. But respectfully, this framing is not only inaccurate — it’s dangerous.
Funding is the issue — the foundational issue. And to downplay that fact doesn’t just mislead readers. It risks giving political cover to those defunding the very system our most vulnerable children rely on.
The West Virginia Department of Human Services itself warned that the proposed cuts would “significantly hinder critical services.” We’re talking about caseworkers, placement options, therapy access, and basic oversight. These are not optional extras — they are the infrastructure of child protection.
When Child Protective Services fails to follow the law — and believe me, they have failed my family and many others — it’s not simply incompetence. It’s the predictable outcome of chronic underfunding and overwork.
West Virginia currently has one Guardian ad Litem (GAL) for every 200 children in custody. How is that tenable? One legal advocate for 200 children. How can a child’s voice be heard under those conditions?
Yes, accountability matters. But it’s a hollow demand if we ignore the structural rot underneath.
I’ve witnessed firsthand how CPS has violated the rights of children and caregivers. I’ve seen a child be denied essential medication. I’ve watched as decisions were made behind closed doors, with no legal justification. And I’ve written legislation — the West Virginia Foster Care Accountability Act — to try and prevent these abuses from repeating.
But reform without funding is performance. And blaming “follow through” while ignoring the missing foundation is like patching drywall in a burning house.
To the WV Foster, Adoptive & Kinship Parents Network: You represent my family and 1,800 others. Please don’t use your platform to deflect attention from the real crisis — a crisis rooted in budget cuts, staff shortages, and resource deprivation.
To legislators: You cannot cut your way to a better foster care system. You are not reducing waste — you are increasing trauma.
To families: You are not alone. The system is flawed, but you are not crazy. Your frustration is justified. And your advocacy matters.
Let’s stop pretending we can solve foster care with platitudes and penny-pinching.
Let’s fix it — for real — with accountability, protection, and yes, adequate funding.

(Murray State photo)Legislation to create schools of veterinary and osteopathic medicine in Kentucky went nowhere in the recently-adjourned General Assembly, but lawmakers did open a path for more public universities to offer such professional and advanced degree programs. 
Senate Bill 77, which received bipartisan support in the General Assembly and was signed into law by Gov. Andy Beshear, allows the state’s comprehensive universities for the first time to seek approval to start professional programs such as medicine or architecture and to offer doctor of philosophy degrees. 
The new law also creates a framework for the Council on Postsecondary Education (CPE) to review a university’s proposal and make a recommendation to the legislature about whether it is viable and should be funded.
Eastern Kentucky University wants to open a school of osteopathic medicine and aims to graduate its first class of physicians in 2034. Murray State University has been working to win approval to open a veterinary medicine school and got a boost last year when the legislature allocated $60 million to construct a new veterinary sciences building now in the design phase.
Western Kentucky University wants to start research doctoral programs.
All of those proposals were introduced as bills during the recently concluded 2025 regular session. None received a committee hearing; instead, lawmakers created a process for deciding when the state needs such programs and to consider the costs.
Needs of students, state
The framework outlined in the law allows lawmakers to have in-depth information, particularly about the financial stability and viability of a proposal, before voting to fund a new program, said Sen. Matthew Deneen, an Elizabethtown Republican.
  Sen. Matthew Deneen (LRC Public Information)
In an interview, Deneen said the legislation “was an opportunity to expand the opportunity” for comprehensive universities in the state to offer more doctoral programs. Besides EKU, Murray and Western, the comprehensive universities are Morehead State and Northern Kentucky universities.
“It’s important to have a framework like this and guidelines in place so that we can make better decisions for the people of the commonwealth, for our students, because ultimately the things that we’re doing here are going to impact the offerings at these comprehensive universities,” Deneen said. “And it’s going to allow them to meet the goals of not only their students but of the overall commonwealth.”
The new law directs CPE to review how the proposed program would align with the goals and mission of the university, the statewide or regional need for the program and demand by students and employers for the program. Universities must also show CPE how the program compliments existing programs, provide a five-year budgetary analysis, possible curriculum and more. 
Before submitting a new proposal, the law says that a comprehensive university must meet some student success measures such as having a first-to-second year retention rate and a six-year graduation rate that is in the 75th percentile of all comprehensive universities nationwide and the 80th percentile of all comprehensive universities within the Southern Regional Education Board. 
Now, CPE is creating policies to determine the eligibility for the new professional programs. Travis Powell, vice president and general counsel of CPE, said the process will likely be similar to how CPE has approved other academic programs in the past. 
  Travis Powell (CPE photo)
“Right now we are in the process of determining initial eligibility … to see who is even eligible to offer programs based on the student success measures that have to be in place and the reserve funding they have to keep,” Powell said. 
Under the new law, CPE can recommend if proposals that will include a funding request to the General Assembly should be funded, Powell said. CPE already makes biennial budget requests to the legislature. The next state budget will be considered in 2026. 
University plans
EKU’s plan to open an osteopathic medicine school would include asking the legislature for nearly $50 million to meet accreditation requirements for reserve funds. 
EKU President David McFaddin told the Lantern the university’s work starts this spring to verify data needed for CPE’s review of the proposal as well as gaining a pre-accrediation status with the Commission on Osteopathic College Accreditation (COCA). While McFaddin acknowledged it is an “aggressive timeline,” EKU plans to have the first class of students graduating in 2034.
The law does “open the door” for all of the state’s comprehensive universities to offer degrees that “may connect back with the overall needs of Kentucky,” McFaddin said. 
“I think at the end of the day for our public institutions, making sure that we’re mapping those degree programs to our community needs to our workforce needs to our economic needs are critically important,” he added.

Murray State recently praised the passage of Senate Bill 77 as the university works toward opening a veterinary medical school. 
In a statement to the Kentucky Lantern, Murray State said a task force will review the development of a course of study for the professional degree program and that the university is “very grateful” to lawmakers and the governor for supporting the bill. 
WKU also praised the passage of the new law, “which moves WKU one step closer to offering PhD programs as we pursue Carnegie R2 status,” said Jace Lux, a university spokesperson in an email. The Carnegie Commission on Higher Education in 1970 created a classification system for institutions. R2 designates mid-level research universities. R1 is the highest level and includes the University of Kentucky and University of Louisville.
“The CPE is currently developing a process to review and approve new PhD programs,” Lux said. “Once that process is finalized and shared with us, we will begin seeking approval for our first PhD in the field of Data Science.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/science-complex.webp,,,2025-04-09 06:01:36.706801

The farm was one of thousands benefiting from a local food program recently cut by the Trump administration. (Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.
“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs [&#8230;]","Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President Donald Trump's nominee for secretary of Health and Human Services, testifies during his Senate Finance Committee confirmation hearing at the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Jan. 29, 2025, in Washington, D.C.  (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunita Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”

(Photo by Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury) Research colleges and universities in Virginia are at risk of taking significant cuts, state lawmakers in the House of Delegates and education experts revealed Tuesday, as the country’s executive branch continues to trim down operations and funding in the federal government.
According to data collected by the National Center for Science and Engineering, Virginia ranks 13th in the nation in research and development (R&D) performance. 


Virginia’s federal workforce breakdown
Federal jobs and contracting equal 16.1% of all full-time and part-time jobs in Virginia.
– 321,516 federal full-time civilian jobs
– 130,751 armed forces
– 441,488 Virginian jobs directly depend on federal contracting

“R&D is important to Virginia, and changes in federal R&D funding and policies will have ripple effects on your entire state and the Virginia Public and Land Grant Universities,” Deborah Altenburg, vice president of research policy and advocacy at the Association of Public and Land-Grant Universities (APLU), said to lawmakers on Tuesday in Alexandria.
Altenburg said every member institution of APLU has had at least one grant canceled or delayed and “there’s really no clarity at this point or way to gauge what the full cost of those cuts will be.”
The funding institutions receive for their facilities and administrative costs could also be capped under the changes, which would be “devastating” to the university-based research structure, since it’s the “major driver for our U.S. economy,” she said.
The changes for research institutions come as lawmakers prepare for the wider impacts on Virginia’s federal workforce and funding reductions, following executive actions taken by President Donald Trump‘s administration since taking office in January to cut what they have called “wasteful” government spending.
So far, the number of available private-sector jobs has declined, and contracts have been canceled in Northern Virginia, InsideNOVA reports. The state’s community colleges have also ended DEI admission policies, in light of federal mandates snuffing out diversity, equity and inclusion practices, while the Trump administration has threatened to yank federal funding from schools that don’t end race-based admissions policies.
Va. community colleges end diversity, equity and inclusion practices

In response to the federal workforce and funding reductions, the Virginia House of Delegates, directed by House Speaker Don Scott, D-Portsmouth, developed a committee to focus solely on how the changes affect Virginians.
The committee is responsible for collecting data on the potential scope of workforce and funding cuts, and analyzing the likely impacts of the cuts on Virginia’s economy and budget should they be partially or fully realized, according to the speaker’s letter.

The committee is responsible for inviting stakeholders across a wide range of interests to provide their perspectives and recommend solutions to the challenges.
Del. David Bulova, D-Fairfax, the committee chair, said the Trump administration’s decisions will have “significant, if not profound” impacts on Virginia, including on its workforce, the state budget and other key areas.
“The federal cuts are going to have a ripple effect on Virginia’s economy and so we need to be prepared to pivot and fill in that gap before it creates budget shortfalls,” Bulova said.
 House committee digs into federal cuts’ impact on Virginia

The committee met in February to plan four meetings in different parts of the state for lawmakers to gather insights from experts on federal workforce and economic impacts statewide and regionally. The first meeting was held Tuesday, at Virginia Tech’s Innovation Campus in Alexandria.
According to the Weldon Cooper Center at the University of Virginia, whose representatives presented at the meeting, Virginia has more federal workers than nearly every other state, and Virginia’s federal workforce is highly educated and concentrated on national security. 
The committee also learned about the federal budget process, and the tools the president’s team is using to excise what they deem to be excessive programming, funding and resources. 
Rescissions and reprogramming are the Trump Administration’s preferred tools to reduce spending — with Congress support — before invoking the Impoundment Control Act (ICA), according to representatives from Crossroads Strategies during Tuesday’s presentation.
The ICA allows temporary deferral of funds, but not cancellation without Congressional approval.
 Uncertainty for research institutions

Lawmakers suggested that Virginia’s research institutions may soon have to begin assessing their grant programs, if more are canceled or even lost. This comes as APLU, the American Council on Education and Association of American Universities and others are fighting against the Trump administration’s decision to cut funds for research projects.
The committee feared institutions may have to raise tuition or limit research to address the potential losses.
“Universities are really in uncharted waters, and each institution will need to make decisions based on their institutions’ resources and risk tolerances,” Altenburg said.

Some of the top federal funding recipients in the commonwealth include the University of Virginia, which received $354.7 million in 2023, followed by Virginia Tech with $28.21 million. 
In 2023, Virginia State University also received $7.2 million and $3.5 million to James Madison University. All these institutions are members of APLU. 
Del. Bonita Anthony, D-Norfolk, said education is at the “core” of Virginia’s success when developing “highly educated and skilled” federal workers.
“If there’s going to be any type of reductions, it’s going to … crumble the very core of our footprint here in Virginia,” Anthony cautioned.
Altenburg, whose association aims to enhance student success and workforce readiness, advance groundbreaking scientific research, and strengthen economic and community engagement, showed how money from the government supports critical aspects of higher education in the state.
Federal funding, now in jeopardy, has supported a combination of direct expenditures and facilities’ administrative costs, Altenburg relayed. Some of the research and development costs include salaries, stipends and equipment.
Del. Briana Sewell, D-Prince William, who is the chair of the House Education subcommittee on higher education, attended Tuesday’s committee meeting and said afterwards “it is crucial for policymakers to fully understand the consequences these cuts may have on both the accessibility and functionality of these institutions. The insights of educators and administrators are vital in ensuring these challenges are addressed effectively.” 
 NOVA Community College support

Amid the troubling prospects from federal reductions, the committee also received good news that it hopes to build on across the commonwealth. 
On Tuesday, Northern Virginia Community College shared that it recently committed $1 million in scholarship aid to allow eligible unemployed federal workers and contractors to enroll in one of 14 courses at no charge, and to access NOVA-sponsored online workshops on resume-writing and job search techniques.
The initiative, referred to as NOVAnext Partnership, is expected to provide scholarships to 1,000 participants.
Anne Kress, president of Northern Virginia Community College, said it’s a step towards stemming federal workers’ lost jobs statewide.
“This is not the solution. It is part of a solution,” said Kress.
Some of the courses included in the initiative focus on providing certifications in IT specialties, program management and human resources. Other instructional opportunities include online entrepreneurship and a new Generative Artificial Intelligence course.
Eligible students must be federal and contract workers who have been laid off on or after Jan. 24, 2025 and reside within the Northern Virginia service area. The NOVA community college system said participants can also enroll in other courses at a regular tuition rate and may qualify for additional state financial aid.
Kress said in two weeks, the community college system has approved 204 applications. Most of the applications are from those impacted by the cuts at USAID.
Del. Tony Wilt, R-Harrisonburg, applauded the initiative.

“This is exciting, and I would also say it’s amazing to me how, in large part, it mirrors what the state of Virginia has already developed and been doing,” Wilt said, referencing Virginia Has Jobs, the state portal touted by Gov. Glenn Youngkin as a solution for laid-off federal workers. 
“It’s great opportunity for us,” Wilt said. “I know we’ve all been concerned about our citizens that have lost jobs and maybe potentially could be coming down the road, but we’ve got good solutions.”

Johnson earned the Most Valuable Player award with a stat line of 21 points, four rebounds and two steals in her team’s 71-59 victory. She shot an impressive 9 for 13 from the field. Cheryl Miller, who’s basketball royalty, coached her team.
The game in Florida featured stars from major programs including the Southeastern, Atlantic Coast and Big 10 conferences. It aired live on ESPN2, and Johnson received a chain basketball hoop as part of her award.
“The opportunity was given to us to showcase our talent to see what we can do on and off the court,” Johnson told All-Star game organizers after her MVP performance. “I am just so grateful for this. So grateful.”
She’s a Philadelphia native, but she has several ties to the commonwealth. Johnson started high school in Hampton and played in the well-known Boo Williams Summer League. In what’s become common in the current college landscape, she previously attended Rutgers and North Carolina State before coming to mid-major NSU in the 2023-24 academic year.
The 5-foot-5 graduate student was named Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference player of the year this season, and she led her team to the NCAA tournament. She also excelled in the classroom, landing on the conference’s All-Academic Team.
A published report says only seven HBCU players have been drafted by the WNBA since its inaugural season in 1997. I attribute that to the high-level competition in the major conferences, as well as the size and skills of those players. (NSU Assistant Director of Sports Communications Noah Schlekeway told me just 14 Spartans have gone on to play in the NBA.)
Johnson, though, has a legitimate shot at becoming the eighth selected from an HBCU at the April 14 draft. At the very least, she’s expanded her opportunities with leagues overseas.
Her televised MVP performance on Saturday ensured it, while also lifting up NSU and other HBCUs in the process.

Two proposals before the Legislature seek to update state law to better identify the children at risk of harm and prevent families from interacting with the child welfare system due to their financial situation. 
“The ambiguous definition of neglect also subjects parents and caregivers to an investigation that mandates surveillance and oversight merely for being poor,” said Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) when introducing his proposal to update the state’s definition of abuse and neglect. 
Maine’s definition of neglect is ‘easy to conflate with poverty’

Hickman’s bill (LD 891) and legislation from Rep. Michele Meyer (D-Eliot), LD 1406, both seek to decouple poverty with the state’s definition of abuse and neglect by clarifying that a child’s needs are willfully withheld. The idea is supported by former foster parents, child welfare advocates and legal organizations; however, some preferred LD 891 because they felt the proposed changes went further to address the issue. 
Attorneys who work with families involved with the child welfare system also generally favored Hickman’s bill, sharing stories with the Health and Human Services Committee on Tuesday about cases they worked on that could have been avoided if the proposed changes had been in place. 
The current law allows for families to be flagged for children missing medical appointments because parents don’t have reliable transportation or children having dirty or ill-fitting clothing, said Molly Owens, parents counsel division chief for the Maine Commission for Public Defense Services. 
“These are cases where there’s no physical or sexual abuse, and children aren’t mistreated or willfully neglected,” Owens said. “Rather, the family is struggling to really and reliably provide basic necessities.”










Our current law places little value on a loving, low-income parent.


– Molly Owens, Maine Commission for Public Defense Services


She added that “our current law places little value on a loving, low-income parent.”
Equating poverty to parental neglect is not unique to Maine. In July 2024, the Biden administration released guidance that states should update their definitions of abuse and neglect to differentiate between a financial inability to provide adequate housing or other material needs. 
Meyer said her bill was born out of advisory groups that included state agencies, child welfare advocates and other entities dedicated to keeping Maine children safe who looked into the state’s mandated reporting laws and how they affect families. The language in her proposal is modeled after the language Kentucky used to update its definition. 
Even if the claims are unsubstantiated, Meyer said it is still traumatic for families to be reported to child protective services. Additionally, having to weed through reports of parents who can’t financially provide certain needs can mean less time for caseworkers to address situations where children face serious harm. 
“If we continue to punish poverty, we will continue to have an overburdened system,” Owens said, speaking in favor of LD 891 and neither for nor against LD 1406. 
Bobbi Johnson, the director of the Office of Child and Family Services, testified in support  of Meyer’s bill, saying it is part of a broader effort to support families in need rather than getting them tangled up in the system. However, she said the child welfare agency is opposed to LD 891 because it inserts certain language that isn’t currently defined in statute and would limit the agency’s ability to intervene in certain accidental situations, even if they are connected to a larger concern about the child’s care. 
Melissa Hackett, coordinator of the Maine Child Welfare Action Network, which also favored LD 1406 due to the input of the broad stakeholder group, encouraged committee members to consider the passion heard for both pieces of legislation.

“I’m like, ‘Wait, wait, wait … let me understand,” Julie recounted. “You are investigating us for abusing this girl because you believe that we’re locking her in her closet and refusing her food, and you’re also telling us, if we do not pick her up from Hampstead Hospital, that we are going to face child abandonment and neglect charges?’ And she said, ‘Right.’”
The situation, which caused anxiety and stress for the parents, was part of a long series of challenges they faced raising their daughter. But it was during this incident that they were connected with the New Hampshire Office of the Child Advocate. The watchdog agency was established by the state Legislature in 2018 to oversee the state’s child welfare, juvenile justice, and care systems, and advocate for the best interests of children. Julie and Richard said it was among the only entities able to help them do right by their daughter. Now, the Office of the Child Advocate is one of the agencies on the chopping block as Republicans seek to shrink the state budget.
‘An altered state’
Julie and Richard adopted their daughter in 2022 soon after moving to New Hampshire. (The Bulletin is not naming the daughter or using the family’s last name to protect her privacy.) 
“My husband and I got married a little bit later in life,” Julie said. “We were in our late 40s when we met, and we were both very, very eager to start a family through adoption.”
In New Hampshire, they began the foster-to-adopt process.
“Really quickly after we got approved, I would say, within a couple of weeks, we got a phone call that there was a little girl who needed emergency respite placement,” Julie said. “There was an incident at her foster home, and so she spent a weekend with us, and it was a wonderful weekend.”
A couple days later they were told she’d need an adoptive home soon, and they didn’t hesitate.
“Less than a week after meeting her, she permanently moved in with us,” Julie continued. “And there was just a series of things that occurred that really, really highlighted to us how much need there is to better fund agencies in the state that are taking care of the state’s most vulnerable children.”
Their new daughter, who was 8 at the time of adoption, had an extensive history of abuse and neglect from her biological family, they said. The couple was horrified by documents they received outlining what the girl had experienced.
“Every abuse you could think of, she suffered at her bio family,” Richard said.
Their daughter was soon diagnosed with reactive attachment disorder, a rare condition that predominately affects children in the foster system. It occurs when a young child doesn’t establish healthy attachments with parents or caregivers, and becomes unable to do so in the future. It can lead to severe behavioral challenges.
For Julie and Richard’s daughter, the condition caused her to become violent. Once the adoption was finalized, their daughter lost access to the therapy and supports she was receiving in the foster system. This now fell all upon Julie and Richard, who promptly began seeking similar supports, but struggled navigating several complex systems with little guidance from the state.
Their daughter would often have violent episodes, and endanger herself and others as a symptom of her disorder, they explained. They and others, such as school counselors, had to call 911 several times, and their daughter has had to stay in hospitals throughout the state, including in Portsmouth, Concord, and Dover. There were incidents with knives, screwdrivers, and pills; sometimes, they said, she’d do thousands of dollars of property damage.
“It got to a point where we had to lock up all our knives and silverware and anything that she could use as a weapon,” Richard said. “Because when she would get into these states, anything and everything she could find, she would use as a weapon.”
Julie emphasized how this is a result of her condition.
“We’ve had brain scans done now with neurofeedback,” Julie said. “And we saw clearly before and after scans where she did not, at that time, have any physiological capability to control her impulses. She was in an altered state, and that’s why, you know, she would grab anything she could, to punch, to hit, to kick, to break things.”
Over the years, they’ve seen a number of therapists and utilized several programs, including in Vermont, Missouri, and Massachusetts.
‘How do we take her home?’
“Aside from, you know, a few individuals that we’ve worked with, we really believe there are too many broken systems in New Hampshire for the children who are most vulnerable,” Julie said. “And the most egregious experience in the state we had is with Hampstead Hospital.”
After an emergency department visit, Julie and Richard’s daughter was transferred to Hampstead Hospital, New Hampshire’s only acute psychiatric hospital and residential treatment facility for youth and young adults, in 2023. They said that after she was at Hampstead for 10 days, they received a call saying she needed to be picked up.
“My response was, ‘Wait, wait, wait, she is incapable of spending any time in person with me without punching and kicking and hitting,’” Julie explained. “‘How do we take her home? We’re going to have to call 911, again.’ And they’re like, ‘Yeah, exactly. That’s how the state works, but you have to come pick her up.’”
They retrieved their daughter, and as they expected, they called 911 because she got violent. They continued trying to work with their daughter through her struggles, but in December 2024, she was getting violent with others and threatening self harm, so she was admitted to an emergency room at Portsmouth Hospital, which eventually referred her to Hampstead Hospital again.
A few weeks later, in January 2025, Hampstead Hospital again demanded they bring their daughter home, this time threatening them with child abandonment charges. They refused to have a care team meeting. Julie said they were “screaming” at her “like a banshee.” Meanwhile, they learned they were being investigated by the state for child abuse — it’s common for children with reactive attachment disorder to falsely accuse parents of abuse or neglect, according to the organization RAD Advocates. Additionally, there was no safety plan to ensure a repeat incident didn’t occur, and they were providing no further support at home. Julie and Richard said they were certain if they brought their daughter home, they’d be forced to call 911 again.
“If we were really abusing our daughter, why would you want the child going home?” Richard said.
Audra Burns, media relations director for Dartmouth Health, which runs Hampstead Hospital through a contract with the state, said in a statement, “We cannot comment on individual patient matters. Hampstead Hospital and Residential Treatment Facility cares for very complex pediatric behavioral health needs and has robust risk assessments and discharge planning to ensure patients are cared for when and where will be most beneficial.” (In February, Dartmouth Health took over the hospital entirely; prior to that, it was contracted to assist with a portion of the operations.)
Jake Leon, communications director for the Department of Health and Human Services, (Hampstead Hospital is owned by the state) said in a statement: “The Department is unable to comment on the specifics of this case due to patient confidentiality laws. The teams at Hampstead Hospital and Dartmouth Health work with DCYF to determine the best long-term treatment path when it is time for a patient to be discharged from a residential setting, factoring in both patient and community safety. The State’s goal is to reduce time spent in residential treatment where appropriate and help youth achieve long-term stability with family and community-based solutions supported by the Behavioral Health System of Care.”
‘Like a 180’
After their daughter’s most recent stay at Hampstead Hospital, Julie and Richard consulted a representative from a program called Fast Forward, who suggested they reach out to the Office of the Child Advocate. Throughout this yearslong process, Julie and Richard have felt mostly alone with little guidance on how to navigate this system and what to do when they believe the system isn’t doing right by their daughter. They’d gotten conflicting advice from different therapists and providers. However, the Office of the Child Advocate was one of a few exceptions to that (along with Fast Forward), they said.
“We were being asked to do something where we felt there were going to be extraordinary safety concerns for our daughter,” Julie said. “And there was no empathy or compassion or planning or concern for our daughter’s safety, until the Office of the Child Advocate got involved.”
Jason Taylor, an assistant child advocate on the team, told them to “call their bluff,” Julie recounted.
“He’s like, ‘Given your story, there’s no judge in this state that is going to file charges against you,’” she said. “‘You have done more than any family would ever be capable of doing, let alone willing. And Hampstead Hospital does this all the time.’”
Taylor helped them keep their daughter in Hampstead Hospital, which wanted to discharge her, until a bed opened up at a facility in Massachusetts. And the couple recruited over a dozen loved ones to write character references and email them to the state with Taylor copied. This got the investigation into them closed, unsubstantiated.
“On Monday morning, I still remember,” Julie said. “It was 10 o’clock. I was in the car. I got a call from (the state), and she’s like, ‘I think there’s been some confusion, and I just want to clear some things up. We don’t believe there’s any abuse going on in your home, and we don’t want to file child abandonment charges.’”
 “When the Office of Child Advocate got involved, it was like a 180,” Richard added.
Julie said the difference between the Massachusetts facility and previous ones they’d been at, particularly in Missouri, was “night and day.”
The two said complex situations like theirs are difficult to navigate without an entity designed to advocate on behalf of the child. They’ve heard that many others have had issues at Hampstead Hospital specifically. They also acknowledged that it must be even more difficult for families who don’t have the financial resources they have. Richard said they’d spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on treatment programs, therapies, and other supports in addition to state-funded programs, and Julie was able to quit her job to focus on their daughter’s treatments.
They wonder how different their story would be if they’d known about the Office of the Child Advocate sooner or how much money the state would’ve saved if it had invested even more in it and similar programs meant to catch issues on the front end before they grow into more costly and devastating tragedies.
‘We need the money’
Julie and Richard’s interactions with the Office of the Child Advocate came a few months before Republicans in the New Hampshire House of Representatives proposed eliminating the office as a cost-cutting measure.
The Legislature is in the middle of the lengthy state budgeting process during a difficult fiscal year. After Gov. Kelly Ayotte released her two-year budget proposal in February, the Republican-led House Ways and Means Committee decided her revenue projections, which predicted a quick economic turnaround after years of lagging business tax revenues, were too optimistic, and the House Finance Committee began proposing funding cuts.
In March, Republicans on House Finance Division I, one of three legislative subcommittees working on the budget, identified the Office of the Child Advocate and several other agencies as areas to cut. That committee voted 5-4, along party lines, to recommend the full House eliminate the Office of the Child Advocate, fire its staff, and repeal the statutes that created it.
Doing so would save the state about $2 million over two years. The House was looking to trim nearly $800 million to match the governor’s budget to their projections.
Rep. Kenneth Weyler, chairman of the House Finance Committee, and Rep. Dan McGuire, chairman of House Finance Division I, did not respond to requests for comment or an interview from the Bulletin. However, at the March work session where they voted to recommend elimination, McGuire said the office — as well as the Commission on Aging, and the Housing Appeals Board, which they also voted to eliminate — are “sort of nice-to-haves, but they’re not necessary.” 
“We need the money,” he continued. “I don’t know how to put it any blunter.”
On Thursday, the full House is set to vote on the budget. If they vote in favor of the budget without an amendment restoring the Office of the Child Advocate, the Senate will consider it. The Senate will have the ability to restore the Office of the Child Advocate or keep it out of the budget. Once they approve a budget and reconcile it with the House if needed, it will go to the governor, who will get the final sign-off.
The House budget proposal being considered Thursday would also eliminate the Office of Early Childhood Education, the State Council on the Arts, the Human Rights Commission, the state’s right-to-know ombudsman, the Housing Appeals Board, and the Governor’s Scholarship Fund.
It would also cut down on state staffing, eliminating 190 positions from the Department of Corrections; 34 in the Liquor Commission; 27 from the Department of Education; 14 in the Department of Business and Economic Affairs; eight in the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources; eight in the Department of Safety; five in the Secretary of State’s Office; and three in the Insurance Department.
The budget also includes cuts of roughly $50 million to the University System of New Hampshire, $46 million to the Department of Health and Human Services, $14.7 million to the Department of Justice, $10 million to the Department of Information Technology, $8.7 million to the New Hampshire Retirement System, $7.9 million to the judicial branch, $6 million to the Department of Environmental Services, $1 million to the legislative branch, $600,000 to the Department of Natural and Cultural Resources, and $100,000 to the governor’s office.
At the same time, the House proposal seeks to expand the state’s voucher-like education freedom accounts program, making it universal by 2026-2027 school year, for an estimated cost of $91 million over two years.
‘Let’s not cut things that protect the children’
Cassandra Sanchez, the New Hampshire child advocate and head of the office, said Julie and Richard’s story is not entirely uncommon. Sanchez and Taylor aren’t allowed to discuss specific cases under department policy, but Sanchez spoke generally about this type of situation, which she said is “one we see far too often at the office.”

“We have received so many of those calls from families — a large number of them adoptive families, others biological families — having attempted to utilize everything available to them in the system, and really at a loss for what to do, because they don’t feel they can keep their child safe,” Sanchez said. “We have become highly involved in those cases, understanding the importance of getting children swiftly into the appropriate level of care, especially if they’re in the acute need for Hampstead Hospital.”
She said they’ve seen numerous issues at Hampstead Hospital, which she said has had staffing issues and has been unable to utilize all their beds. She said her office spends a significant amount of time at Hampstead Hospital, monitoring the services and speaking with children there.
Meanwhile, Julie and Richard hope others see the value in the child advocate.
“If there’s a subset of people who do not have a voice, do not have a mechanism for advocating for themselves, it’s children, right?” she said. “So that should be the one place where, no matter what your political leaning is, you can get around this. Like, let’s not cut things that protect the children who don’t have a voice, that can’t help themselves, right?”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/julierichard-1024x523.jpg,,,2025-04-09 06:01:36.706801

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)For a week, global financial markets have plunged and swung wildly as a result of President Donald Trump’s huge tariffs. Already, auto-sector layoffs have started at a company with a big Ohio presence. 
One Republican Ohio U.S. Senator seems to have embraced the tariffs. The other says he’s talking to concerned parties about them. One candidate for the GOP governor nomination in 2026 also embraced the tariffs, while a Democratic candidate condemned them. The others who are either in the Republican field or potentially so didn’t comment.
The global financial markets on Tuesday were regaining some of their value after Chinese companies started buying stocks to stabilize them. But already, Trump’s 25% tariff on vehicles had slowed imports and temporarily shut down some factories, the New York Times reported.
Stellantis, the Netherlands-based company that owns Dodge, Chrysler, and Jeep, laid off 900 people temporarily at powertrain and stamping plants in Michigan and Indiana. If a trade war persists, the company’s roughly 2,600 union workers at its Jeep plant in Toledo could also eventually be affected.

In addition, the tariffs, which are taxes on imports, are expected to raise consumer prices by 2.3%, according to the Budget Lab at Yale University.
Since Trump began announcing the tariffs last week, he’s been accused of serious mathematical bungling. 
Economists at the conservative American Enterprise Institute said that the tariffs themselves make no sense. But even if they did, they said, the formula on which they’re based contains a math error that inflates the tariffs fourfold.
Meanwhile, all the volatility created by the tariffs has created uncertainty that can make business planning all but impossible, Nobel Prize-winning columnist Paul Krugman told the New York Times.
Even so, Trump isn’t backing down, and he’s not admitting any mistakes. That has billionaires who supported Trump’s election pleading with officials in his administration to persuade him to change course.
Given the implications for the Ohio economy, one might think the state’s leaders would weigh in. But after queries were made Monday of the sitting governor, four likely candidates to run for that office in 2026 and the state’s two U.S. senators, only three responded.
The officials were asked whether they supported the Trump tariffs and what they would say to Ohioans who’ve seen their retirement accounts depleted as the markets plunged. 
Trump is selling the import taxes as painful medicine to bring back manufacturing. The current and would-be Ohio officials were also asked how long people should have to suffer before that happens.
One response came from the campaign of pharmaceutical entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, who is seeking the 2026 GOP nomination to be governor. Ramaswamy left a lead position with Elon Musk’s government-slashing “Department of Government Efficiency” to mount his campaign.
“President Trump endorsed Vivek because he’s laser-focused on an America First, Ohio First agenda, including sparking a manufacturing boom by cutting red tape, building a skilled workforce, and unleashing the energy dominance needed to power Ohio’s economic revival,” Ramaswamy campaign manager Jonathan Ewing said in an email. “For decades, Ohio workers have been hit hard by America’s manufacturing exodus, and it’s time to hit back. Vivek is focused on advancing bold, no-nonsense solutions to restore opportunity for all hardworking Ohioans and make our state an economic powerhouse once again.”
Nervous senators from both parties press Trump trade rep on tariffs as high as 104%

Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, who is also seeking the GOP nomination, didn’t respond. 
Governor’s Office Press Secretary Dan Tierney was asked where Gov. Mike DeWine stood on Trump’s tariffs. He was also asked for a press contact for newly appointed Lt. Gov. Jim Tressel, so the same questions could be put to that person. Tierney didn’t respond. 
DeWine appointed Tressel to fill the lieutenant governor’s spot after appointing former Lt. Gov. Jon Husted to fill the U.S. Senate seat vacated by J.D. Vance when he became vice president. Tressel hasn’t announced a candidacy for governor, but as a former football coach of a national-championship Ohio State Buckeye team, there has been speculation that he has the popularity to run.
Dr. Amy Acton, a Columbus-area physician who is seeking the Democratic nomination for governor, said Trump was needlessly making life harder for average Ohioans.
“Our leaders should be solving problems not creating them,” she said in an email. “Ohioans across the state who are struggling with the cost of living shouldn’t have to worry about our President starting reckless trade wars and causing chaos with tariffs that raise costs and make our lives even harder. We need a real plan to lower costs and raise wages that starts with listening to local communities — not simply picking fights to fake toughness.
Husted’s office commented on tariffs, but it didn’t say whether he supported Trump’s.
“Ohio is a strong Made-in-America state, and the senator is talking with and listening to Ohio job creators and workers all the time about what policies, including tariffs and tariff relief, they may need in order to get the inputs required to produce goods here at home,” Deputy Chief of Staff Jess Andrews said in an email. “He was on the ground alongside Ohio workers recently doing just that, and he is sharing these priorities with the administration directly.”
Ohio’s other new Republican senator, Bernie Moreno, didn’t respond to questions for this story, but he appears to be embracing the Trump tariffs on social media.
“Career politicians like (former Vice President Mike Pence) are part of the problem, they did nothing for decades while our industrial sector was gutted,” he said on X the day the tariffs were implemented. “President Trump is finally reversing their failed policies and fighting back for American workers. That’s exactly what we saw today.”

[&#8230;]","People stand outside of a Mennonite church in Seminole after a funeral for an 8-year-old girl  who died of measles on Sunday, April 6, 2025.Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”



North Carolina impacts will likely be problematic
A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services told NC Newsline on Tuesday that while the agency is doing its best to monitor and respond to the measles threat and doesn’t yet know the full impact of federal cuts, “We do know these cuts will significantly reduce our ability to quickly respond to potential measles cases and outbreaks.”
Among the known impacts identified by the spokesperson:

Lost funding for surge staff who are trained to assist with outbreak investigations and other public health responses, including measles response.
Loss of temporary and contracted staff who support DHHS’s ability to prevent, detect and respond to infectious disease threats.
Loss of corrections response team, which helped to provide hands on consultations to jails and state corrections.
Reduced ability to rapidly identify and respond to measles and other infectious disease cases in hospitals.
Potential delays in receiving and responding to reports of positive test results for measles.

Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University's School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

One reason is that state programs aren’t always called “Medicaid.” Many states have rebranded their programs with consumer-friendly names such as SoonerCare in Oklahoma, Apple Health in Washington, Medi-Cal in California or TennCare in Tennessee.
And nearly all states now use private insurance companies such as UnitedHealth or Blue Cross Blue Shield to run their Medicaid programs. That means Medicaid enrollees may hold an insurance card and paperwork with the name of a commercial insurance company.
“We toss around terms like ‘Medicaid,’ but we see so many of our patients not having [insurance cards or] anything that describes or uses the word ‘Medicaid,’” said Dr. Adam Brown, a Washington, D.C.-based emergency physician and founder of a health care strategy firm.
“People oftentimes do not realize either that they have it, or know the value of what it does.”

Medicaid is the health insurance program for people with low incomes or certain disabilities. About 72 million people, or about a fifth of all the people living in the United States, are enrolled. It operates with state and federal funding, but every state has the freedom to choose how to run its program, within federal rules.
As a result, Medicaid is a sprawling patchwork of programs that can confuse lawmakers and even top health officials, not to mention the average beneficiary. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, incorrectly described basic elements of Medicaid and seemed to confuse it with Medicare during his January confirmation hearing before Congress.
Republicans in Congress are considering proposals to slash hundreds of billions of dollars from federal Medicaid funding as they look to offset trillions in tax cuts proposed by President Donald Trump. The specifics of the Medicaid cuts are still being hammered out. But any reductions to federal Medicaid spending would shift those costs to states, which would likely be forced to end services or cut coverage for certain groups of people.
“Part of the problem is when we hear people talk on television or hear lawmakers talk, there are many people that don’t make the connection that they themselves are on [Medicaid] or that their hospital is very much dependent upon the dollars that come from Medicaid,” said Brown.
Republicans in Congress are eyeing cuts to Medicaid. But what does Medicaid actually do?

“Calling it one thing and branding it something very different, that makes it challenging for people to understand the connection or the value in the product that they actually have.”
About 3 in 4 people who have Medicaid are enrolled in managed care organizations (MCOs), according to the latest national data. Most of these are private plans operated by companies such as UnitedHealth Group and Centene. But the branding from these companies can distance recipients from the fact that their care is paid for with public funds.
When Brown worked in emergency medicine, he had many patients who had insurance through Medicaid.
“There were times they would show me their card and it would have commercial branding, like a Blue Cross Blue Shield,” he said. But as they talked, “I noticed there was a lack of understanding that they were on a Medicaid-supported or state/federal-supported program.”
Millions of people who are enrolled in Medicaid mistakenly believe they’re uninsured, Dr. Ben Sommers, a Harvard health economist and physician, told Stateline.
“It is a long-standing issue that got worse during the pandemic,” he said.
He and fellow researchers found that the gap between the number of people who have Medicaid and the number who think they have it jumped during the pandemic, to about 18.5 million people. This was due to a lack of public understanding about a COVID-era rule that granted continuous Medicaid coverage to people without requiring them to re-enroll, researchers found.
Sommers expects the gap will eventually return to pre-pandemic levels, or nearly 6 million people.
“That’s still a lot of people who don’t think they’re in Medicaid but who are,” he said.
There are also some uninsured people who enroll in Medicaid when they show up at an emergency room or clinic needing care. Most providers will check for Medicaid eligibility if a person doesn’t have another form of insurance. People who become Medicaid beneficiaries that way may not realize it’s Medicaid paying for their care, Sommers said.
Public debate
Physicians, public health experts and advocates worry that the confusion over Medicaid is affecting public debate over funding cuts.











It can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.


– Ben Sommers, Harvard University health economist and physician



From a public health perspective, Sommers said, “It’s not a huge problem if people think they have one type of insurance and misclassify it, as long as they’re getting care.
“Politically, it can be tricky if people don’t recognize they have Medicaid and they’re trying to weigh in on policies that affect Medicaid.”
Conservatives have long argued for reducing the reach of Medicaid. They say the program is too expensive and that its expansion under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, diverts too much money toward able-bodied adults and away from the more vulnerable populations it was originally intended to help.
But despite the controversy surrounding Medicaid, the program is extremely popular. More than 3 in 4 people view Medicaid favorably, including nearly two-thirds of Republicans, according to a January tracking poll from KFF.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

In focus groups conducted in January by KFF, no Trump voters and few Harris voters said they were aware of proposals to cut federal Medicaid dollars, and some Trump voters said they didn’t think Trump would follow through on the cuts.
Making the connection
Brown said that despite confusion, most Medicaid patients he encountered were aware their insurance came through a government program.
But he said it can still be hard for people — including those with private insurance — to make the connection between Medicaid funding cuts and their local hospitals or other services.
“We oftentimes frame this [debate over Medicaid funding cuts] as ‘People will lose their health insurance,’ and that is true,” Brown said. But “the constituencies affected are not just the people who have Medicaid.”
Less funding for Medicaid, or an increase in the number of people without insurance, would harm people with any kind of insurance, he said. It could lead to longer wait times at hospitals, fewer services offered and, in some cases, hospital closures.
“One of the important parts about democracy is people being educated about what their representatives are voting for or against, and also how to advocate for yourself,” Brown said. “If you don’t fundamentally understand or fully grasp the benefits you have, then it’s harder to advocate.”

___________________
Workers at one of the nation’s largest baby formula plants say the Abbott Laboratories facility is engaging in unsanitary practices similar to those that led it to temporarily shut down just three years ago, sparking a nationwide formula shortage.

Current and former employees told ProPublica that they have seen the plant in Sturgis, Michigan, take shortcuts when cleaning manufacturing equipment and testing for microbes. The employees said leaks in the factory are sometimes not fixed, a dangerous problem that can promote bacterial growth. They also said workers at the facility do not always take required swabs to check for pathogens while performing maintenance during production. Supervisors have urged workers to increase production and have retaliated against workers who complained about problems, the employees said.
One worker complained to the Food and Drug Administration in February, saying the plant has experienced “persistent leaks” and “unaddressed contamination issues,” according to correspondence between the worker and the agency viewed by ProPublica. Water and chemicals have pooled on the floor, the worker said. In one spot, white sweetener oozed from a pipe and formed a pile like a stalagmite on top of a tank used for blending, the employee said.
The complaints come as the Trump administration is dismantling wide swaths of the federal government — including conducting mass layoffs at the FDA — and filling some key regulatory positions with industry-friendly voices. The new head of the FDA division that oversees baby formula is a corporate lawyer who previously defended Abbott against a lawsuit.
The workers ProPublica spoke to said they did not want to be named because they feared repercussions from Abbott management, but they felt compelled to speak up out of concern that a baby who drank formula made at the plant would fall ill.
“I can’t have this on my conscience,” one of the workers said.
Abbott called workers’ assertions “untrue or misleading,” denied their claims about retaliation and said the company “stands behind the quality and safety of all our products including those made at Sturgis.” In a statement, a spokesperson said that since 2022, the company had increased plant staff by 300 people, spent $60 million on upgrades and stationed multiple food-safety consultants there on weekdays. The company said the plant often takes more than 10,000 environmental swabs across the facility in a month to check for microbes.
“We believe Sturgis is the most inspected, tested, and swabbed infant formula manufacturing facility in the U.S., and likely in the world,” the statement said.
That said, Abbott conceded that the plant acted “outside of our quality process” in one incident from last May.
Workers told ProPublica that, instead of retrieving a portable pump, an employee used a piece of cardboard from a trash bin to funnel coconut oil, a formula ingredient, into a tank during production of the company’s Pure Bliss by Similac Organic brand. Abbott said the cardboard “was reactively used to prevent spilling onto the floor.” The company denied that there was a trash receptacle in the area and said plant practice was for cardboard to be stacked on a pallet before being recycled.
Food-safety laws require companies to use clean tools to transfer ingredients, not a makeshift implement like cardboard, said Patrick Stone, a former FDA inspector who works as a consultant.
“No one would think that’s a proper use,” he said. “It’s not something that’s been cleaned and verified it’s clear of contamination.”
Abbott, however, downplayed the significance of the incident, saying it occurred early in the manufacturing process, before pasteurization, and the product underwent “enhanced testing” that came back negative for microbes.
“We acknowledge that this is outside of our quality process, and this has been addressed,” Abbott’s statement said. The company said the plant had a discussion with the employee reiterating the proper procedure.
Employees complained about the incident at the time and some hoped the plant had destroyed the formula. But a few weeks later, they received an email, which ProPublica viewed, that said the plant had released all batches “not just on time, but early.” It congratulated workers for an “amazing milestone and achievement for Sturgis.”
Abbott said there have been no medical complaints related to the lot. The brand is advertised as suitable for newborns.
In another incident in February, an employee said that the company had signed off on the use of an amino acid that was 10 months past its manufacturer’s “best by” date. A photo of the label viewed by ProPublica showed a best by date of April 2024. The law requires that ingredients in formula not expire before the formula as a whole, Stone said.
Abbott said that the powder’s expiration date had been “extended,” which it said regulations permit in some cases, after the company used third-party testing to confirm its nutrient levels.
But the worker said the amino acid powder was “chunky” and employees refused to add it to a formula mixture. It had been manufactured in October 2023.
Abbott told ProPublica that two containers of amino acid mix were, in fact, placed on hold due to “crustiness” and later destroyed. “When we find products that don’t meet all specifications, we dispose of them,” the company said.
Some of the workers said they’ve felt pressure not to disrupt the manufacturing process. At one meeting in February, a worker said a senior manager told employees the plant needed to improve its profit margins by either increasing production or reducing the amount of formula it was discarding as unusable.
Abbott disputed the idea that it is cutting corners to make more formula.
“Any assertion that quality is being sacrificed at the expense of volume and profit is patently untrue,” it said. The company said that in 2024, Abbott made 41% less formula at Sturgis than it had in 2021, the year before the shutdown.
For its part, the FDA did not respond to questions about whether an inspection or investigation is taking place at the Sturgis plant in response to the complaint it received. The agency said it generally does not comment on “potential or ongoing inspections or investigations.”
In a statement, the FDA said that it “takes reports related to infant formula seriously and follows up as appropriate.”
The case could prove to be a major test for President Donald Trump’s second administration, which just last month announced an effort to “ensure the ongoing quality, safety, nutritional adequacy, and resilience of the domestic infant formula supply.” Dubbed Operation Stork Speed, it promised to increase ingredient testing and communicate regularly with consumers and the industry “as significant developments occur to ensure transparency, including information regarding nutrients and health outcomes.”
 “Egregiously Unsanitary” Conditions

The Abbott employees’ concerns come three years after the company voluntarily recalled several formula brands, including Similac, Alimentum and EleCare, and temporarily halted production at Sturgis amid reports of unsanitary conditions and infant deaths.
A former plant employee in 2021 had told the FDA that the plant was using lax cleaning practices, falsifying records and releasing untested infant formula to the public. FDA inspectors found leaking equipment valves, standing water and a type of bacteria at the plant called Cronobacter sakazakii, which is common but can be deadly for young babies. Company documents showed the manufacturer had even discovered the bacteria in its finished formula in 2019 and 2020, the report said. Food-safety laws require companies to test samples of their formula to check the nutrient content and look for harmful microorganisms.
Those inspection findings were “shocking,” a former FDA chief said later. He called the plant “egregiously unsanitary.”
Initial reports said several infants were hospitalized and two died from an illness caused by the Cronobacter bacteria after drinking formula made at the Sturgis plant, according to an inspector general’s report. Between December 2021 and June 2022, it said the FDA received a total of 16 consumer complaints involving infant deaths and Sturgis facility products.
The report said the FDA did not directly link drinking formula from the plant to any of the infants’ illnesses or deaths. Abbott said no unopened Abbott formula has ever tested positive for Cronobacter.
Still, in May of 2022, Abbott signed a consent decree with the Department of Justice and the FDA and committed to following improved procedures at the facility. The decree is still in effect. It says the company can be fined up to $30,000 a day for violations, with a maximum of $5 million in a year.
The plant’s nearly four-month-long shutdown in 2022 sparked a nationwide formula shortage, which was worsened by COVID-19-related supply-chain issues. Store shelves emptied of formula, leaving parents desperate. Some babies developed symptoms such as spitting up and diarrhea after being forced to switch brands, researchers found. Nearly half of parents in one survey of primarily low-income families said they’d resorted to at least one unsafe feeding practice, such as watering down formula.
Abbott said it disagreed “vehemently” with the FDA chief’s comments on the Sturgis plant being unsanitary, and it said the former employee who filed the 2021 complaint with the agency was dismissed for “serious violations” of its food-safety policies. Abbott said the employee’s specific claims were not supported by the FDA. “It’s time to stop giving credence and fame to individuals with questionable agendas” that have led to “unnecessary” formula shortages, Abbott said.
 New Complaints Arise as FDA Is Cut

It’s unclear how the Trump administration, with its reduced federal workforce, will respond to the newest complaints. The administration recently eliminated 3,500 FDA jobs as part of extensive cuts in federal health workers’ ranks. While officials said the reductions will not impact inspectors, the agency did not answer a question about whether any of the employees being let go are involved in inspection or enforcement for the Sturgis facility.
The White House also recently installed a corporate lawyer in a top FDA post, putting him in charge of the agency’s regulation of formula. Kyle Diamantas, acting deputy commissioner for human foods, previously defended Abbott against a lawsuit in which families alleged the company failed to warn them about a deadly bowel condition that premature babies who are fed formula have a greater risk of developing. Abbott has appealed a verdict in which it was ordered to pay $495 million.
Meanwhile, at the Department of Agriculture, officials disbanded an advisory committee that had been studying the threat of Cronobacter contamination in powdered formula. The USDA said at the time that it did so to comply with an executive order seeking to reduce bureaucracy but it remained committed to food safety. The Heritage Foundation’s Project 2025 blueprint for a Trump presidency had listed as one of its goals reevaluating “excessive regulation” of infant formula.
Families using formula aren’t being protected if the FDA is acting like a partner to companies like Abbott instead of overseeing them, said Jennifer Pomeranz, a professor and expert in public health and food policy at New York University who has served as a witness for plaintiffs suing Abbott over the bowel condition. She called Diamantas’ appointment the “perfect example of regulatory capture.”
In its statement to ProPublica, the FDA said it is “committed to enhancing regulatory oversight of all infant formula manufacturers to help ensure that the industry is producing infant formula under the safest conditions possible.”
The Sturgis plant is a major supplier of formula in the United States and had been producing about 20% of the nation’s formula when it shut down in 2022. Abbott provides formula to more than half of babies in the government-backed nutrition-assistance program, called WIC, that subsidizes families’ formula purchases. The company has contracts to be the sole source of formula for WIC recipients in 36 states and Washington, D.C., as of August of last year.
 “If You Have Leaks, Forget About It”

Since the 2022 consent decree, FDA records show it has completed 10 inspections, including a multiweek review that was underway when employees said the cardboard incident took place. (The company says that according to its records, it has been inspected by FDA 12 times in that period.) No action was required in response to most of those visits, according to a database that tracks FDA inspections.
But for one inspection that ended in December 2022, the FDA issued a citation that noted concerns related to contamination prevention, worker hygiene and the handling of consumer complaints, documents say.
A report from that inspection — completed just seven months after Abbott signed the consent decree — said the agency found problems similar to those that had shut down the plant.
The report noted, among other things, six instances of employees failing to collect required swabs to test for bacterial contamination after cleaning up a leak. It also said inspectors found “apparent insects and dust like debris” near formula-making equipment. “You did not establish a system of process controls covering all stages of processing that was designed to ensure that infant formula does not become adulterated due to the presence of microorganisms in the formula or in the processing environment,” the report said.
Stone, the former FDA inspector who is now a consultant, said the citation is significant. “FDA should have really hammered on them harder,” he said, “but they’re weak and they’re scared.”
Without taking those swabs and testing them, the company cannot know if the formula is contaminated, Stone said.
“Unless you’re monitoring your environment, you don’t know what’s in your environment,” he said. “If you have leaks, forget about it. You don’t know what’s in there.”
Abbott said it “has addressed all FDA observations” from 2022. FDA inspectors have raised no major issues since then, the company said.
In 2023, Abbott confirmed the Department of Justice had opened a criminal investigation into conduct at the plant. A spokesperson for the department’s Western District of Michigan did not respond to a request for information about the investigation’s status. Abbott did not respond to a question about the probe but said at the time that it was “cooperating fully.” The Securities and Exchange Commission and Federal Trade Commission were also scrutinizing the company after the problems surfaced in Sturgis. Spokespeople for the SEC and FTC, which released a report on the formula supply disruptions, declined to comment. Abbott did not respond to questions about the investigations.
More recently, some employees who spoke to ProPublica said plant leaders have urged them to speed up production — even though the consent decree aimed to add more safety protocols. “Imagine a 10-page rule book you’re told you have to operate by no matter what,” one said. “No deviations. You’re doing that, and then your boss says, ‘You’re not doing your job fast enough.’”
The workers said some employees have pushed supervisors to follow sanitary procedures more closely and at times refused to run equipment until their concerns about sanitation were met, even as they feared losing their jobs. Abbott is one of the largest and highest-paying employers in the largely rural area near the Indiana border. The plant’s tall white tower, emblazoned with a large green “a,” looms over nearby homes.
An employee said that since the consent decree, he had witnessed leaks of formula, oil, chemicals and water that were not cleaned up, fixed or documented properly. Sometimes, the worker said, supervisors resisted shutting down machinery — always a money-losing proposition — to address a leak. The worker reported seeing a leak that hadn’t been handled correctly more than once a month. “It’s all over,” the employee said.
Photos taken in the plant show equipment whose outer surface was streaked with drips from formula ingredients that had leaked. In one instance, an absorbent mat had been placed on the floor to catch drips. Procedures require the plant to contain leaks, fix equipment and test the area for pathogens, workers say. Leaks can become breeding grounds for bacteria.
Abbott said “in a facility the size of Sturgis, with literally miles of pipes, leaks, drips, and condensation are inevitable.” The plant has a team it deploys quickly to contain leaks, then swab, test and sanitize the area, the company said. The plant aims to limit standing water and sanitize regularly to prevent bacterial growth, Abbott said, and it runs six times the number of Cronobacter tests on finished product samples as required by federal regulations.
“Abbott has a quality policy that we make our products as if they were for our own families,” the company’s statement said. “If quality were not our first priority Abbott would not still be here at 137 years.”
A contractor Abbott hired to improve its processes has raised concerns about the facility not following protocols or procedures in past audits but cited no such problems in the audit completed earlier this year, said Mansour Samadpour, co-founder of IEH Laboratories and Consulting Group. IEH, which began its work after the consent decree, reports back to Abbott and the FDA on what the plant needs to correct. Neither Abbott nor IEH provided a copy of the most recent audit.
Samadpour declined to detail the earlier concerns. He said it was possible an employee could miss a swab, but said there’s no systemic problem. He said he does not have concerns about sanitary practices in the plant.
“If I have any concerns, they will hear from me and FDA will hear from us,” said Samadpour, who spoke with ProPublica at Abbott’s request. “That is our job.”

(Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)North Carolina state senators approved a bill Tuesday that would spin up a new team in the Republican state auditor’s office to scrutinize state spending and job openings.
Drawing inspiration from Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, the bill would instruct Auditor Dave Boliek’s office to use A.I. to examine government and recommend any offices or jobs to be cut. Boliek’s new team (with an acronym of “DAVE”) would not have the sole power to cut jobs or spending, and would be dissolved at the end of his term.
Senate Bill 474 passed the chamber on a 29-17, party-line vote. It now heads to the House.
Sen. Tim Moffitt (R-Henderson), who sponsored the bill, called it a “comprehensive look at how our state agencies utilize taxpayer money.”
Senate Democrats, as well as the State Employees Association of North Carolina, strongly opposed the bill, arguing that it further hurts the state’s ability to recruit and retain government workers.
“(Republicans) are not going to fill the 20% vacancy rates of positions that North Carolinians need and depend on,” Sen. Terence Everitt (D-Granville) told reporters after the vote. “And they don’t want to take responsibility for their own failures of mismanaging an economy for 14 years.”
Democrats filed a series of unsuccessful amendments Tuesday, including one to require the auditor to also examine school voucher spending and crisis pregnancy centers that receive state dollars.
Boliek, who beat Democrat and former Auditor Jessica Holmes last November, has spoken in support of the bill. He argues it effectively shores up authority his office already has — while adding resources and setting a precise timeline by which to make recommendations to lawmakers.
And he’s said that A.I., which is not currently utilized in an official capacity by state government, would be a useful tool for the new team.
“The fact is, we’ve got to start somewhere in the state of North Carolina using A.I.,” Boliek said during a committee hearing last week. “Because it’s coming. There’s no better place than the state auditor’s office to get started with that.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_1385-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 06:01:36.706801

What could the tragic 19th Century Irish potato famine have to do with modern Medicaid work requirements promoted by North Carolina Republicans?
As author Padraic Scanlan documents in a powerful new book, the parallels between what the men running the British Empire did to the peasants of Ireland nearly two centuries ago and the policies North Carolina legislative leaders are pursuing today are quite striking.
As Scanlan documents in horrific detail, one of the chief contributors to the famine — a disaster that caused more than 1.5 million people to die or flee the tiny country — was the refusal of the British politicians and landowners who ruled Ireland to distribute relief because they thought it would violate rules of the free market and encourage laziness among the peasants.
Sound familiar? It should.
The bottom line: Medicaid work requirements won’t kill as many people as the pro-starvation policies of the British in Ireland, but some will die and the maddening arrogance of the policy makers in the two situations is essentially indistinguishable.

If it wasn’t the advocacy gathering on Tuesday, it could have been the calls and emails legislators received amid the budget process, according to some that attended the event.
“I have never in my entire time in the Statehouse received more emails and phone calls from individuals … advocating for their libraries,” said House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington, to cheers from the crowd.
Republican House Speaker Pro Tempore Gayle Manning also said she’s “been receiving a lot of emails lately,” as has state Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland.
“It is very clear what your interests are,” said Cirino, who will face budget negotiations head-on as the budget discussion heads for the Senate Finance Committee, of which he is the chair.

Cirino made no guarantees about funding, partly because the House had not finished their discussions of the omnibus bill as of Tuesday morning when he spoke to the crowd.

“No guarantees, don’t know what it’s going to end up as,” Cirino said. “But trust me, you’ve got a lot of us that really believe in libraries and what you do and what you bring to the communities.”
A summary of the omnibus bill released on Tuesday afternoon states that the current distribution of state funds to public libraries was put back, instead of a proposed “population-based formula” initially written into the House budget draft. The omnibus bill is set to be put to a vote on Wednesday.
The new budget amendment appropriates $490 million in fiscal year 2026 for the Public Library Fund, and $500 million in fiscal year 2027.
The House budget proposal, even with the restoration of the PLF, comes in at a lower allocation than Gov. Mike DeWine proposed in his executive budget, which had an increase to the fund from 1.7% to 1.75% of tax revenue in the General Revenue Fund.
According to the Ohio Library Council, DeWine’s proposal would have allocated $531.7 million in 2026 and $549.1 million the year after.
DeWine praised libraries at Tuesday’s event, and said, of funding public libraries as it has been done for the last century, “I think that’s probably something that really should be continued.”
“Our libraries are really at the center of each community,” DeWine said. “It doesn’t matter whether it’s in an inner city, it doesn’t matter whether it’s in Harrison County or any of our smaller counties.”
Asked for tips on advocating as the budget moves on to the Senate, the governor said engaging directly with the senators in individual districts would make the most impact, and give them the perspective of those in their communities.
“We all react to people and we react to stories,” he said. “Statistics are interesting, stories are people.”
Anne Rhodes and Allison Howell, of the Mansfield/Richland County Public Library, were more than happy to give DeWine and others the story of their library, which not only provides reading services, but also a “library of things” where residents can rent items such as power tools and board games. The library can help convert old VHS tapes and other old recording types for free, and brings their bookmobile to nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
Rhodes said a community member told her his mother gets books from the bookmobile monthly, looking forward to the delivery every time.
“He said it has just changed her world,” Rhodes said. “It gives her something to do and keeps her interested, and she’s excited to see what she gets every month.”
The “library of things” not only saves people the cost of buying a power tool or musical instrument that they may only need temporarily, but helps enrich lives without the burden of cost, Howell said.
“We have kids come in and they get so happy that they can get a board game that they can play with their parents because they may not be able to afford a board game,” she said.

Library patrons were panicked when they heard news that state funding might be at risk, according to Rhodes.
“When they started talking about these budget cuts, I don’t know how many phone calls we got in our office, pretty much immediately with people, their hair was on fire,” Rhodes said. “I’ve had people call in tears that they’re worried about the cuts.”
Russo, Manning, Cirino, and state Sen. Beth Liston, D-Dublin, all spent some of their time at the library advocacy event explaining how their local libraries benefitted them, from reading help when they were children, to helping their own children, and giving them space to hear from constituents on the issues of the day. Now, more than ever, legislators said libraries are in need of support.
“I think everyone will agree that in our changing times, there has been a huge need for places where people can come together and gather and feel part of things,” Liston said. “I would agree that it is critical that we maintain the funds for the library system through our public library funding.”
Cirino didn’t question the value of libraries, but as the budgeting process goes forward into his committee and the Senate, he said a big question will be: “How much can we afford to support it?”
“I think like everybody else that we appropriate, it should be a biennial appropriation process that’s justified based on input and feedback that we get, not an automatic number,” Cirino told media after he spoke to the library group. “… I think the way that the House presented it in their sub bill (with a population-based formula) … I think will actually be better off for libraries.”
Russo said changes to the Public Library Fund that would reduce the monies going to those entities, even more so than the $27 million public libraries lost over the last year, would bring the costs back to the residents. Without state funding, libraries are forced to ask for property tax levies to supplement the costs of business and performing what Russo said are “critical needs in our communities.”
“When we take money away from those efforts that are being done very well in our communities, that actually costs us money in the longterm,” Russo told the Capital Journal. “The reason that our communities have to keep going back to local residents is because we are not doing our share here at the Statehouse.”

Ohio state senators took up the House version of a broad-based energy bill Tuesday aimed at encouraging new power generation. Backers warn the regional energy grid known as PJM is teetering on the verge of shortfall. Forecasts suggest energy demands could outpace supply as soon as next year.
With those alarms ringing in their ears, lawmakers in the House and Senate have been advancing bills on parallel tracks. Both chambers approved their proposals in recent weeks with broad bipartisan support.

But Tuesday’s hearing wasn’t the beginning of a fast-track process. Senators cancelled a follow up hearing scheduled for Wednesday and they’re preparing to leave town on a two-week recess. In the House, meanwhile, attention is focused squarely on the budget.
Sen. Brian Chavez, R-Marietta, who heads up the Senate energy committee explained they haven’t yet settled on which bill will be the vehicle for passage.
“We haven’t figured that out yet. The House is focused on the budget right now,” Chavez said after committee.
“I think we’ll pick one and we’ll just go with it,” he added, “and we’ll blend them together and hopefully come up with a really solid bill.”
There’s agreement on the broad strokes, but with lawmakers headed for the exits, hammering out the details might stretch into May. And despite wrestling over language for months, lawmakers and stakeholders have a few additional tweaks in mind.
What’s distinct about HB 15
Both proposals encourage new power plant investment with tax incentives and assurances that monopoly distribution companies (think AEP, Duke or FirstEnergy) can’t jump into the marketplace. They also shake up how those distribution companies set rates, and repealing a widely criticized subsidy for aging coal plants.
Ohio House approves sweeping energy generation bill

But HB 15 carries a handful of additional provisions. Utilities would have to create “heat maps” reflecting energy capacity on quarterly basis. The state power siting board would gain oversight of transmission projects that currently have little. Critics argue that allows companies to make big investments and pass the cost on to ratepayers. The House bill also includes a pilot program for community power where small groups could chip in on new power generation to defray their existing power bills.
The Senate bill includes a program loaning schools money for solar from an existing fund.  The House instead would eliminate it and refund the balance to consumers.
Ideas
Senators sitting on the Energy committee heard another round of the suggestions they’ve heard before. AEP Ohio’s Steve Nourse asked lawmakers for a “glide path” off the coal plant subsidies. Those subsidies are the result of 2019’s House Bill 6 which is at the center of the largest corruption case in Ohio’s history. Consumers have already spent close to half a billion dollars on propping up the plants.
Utilities, barred from any role in energy production under HB 15, urged lawmakers to let them get involved “behind the meter” — providing on-site power plants for big customers like data centers.
The Ohio Consumers’ Counsel Maureen Willis suggested lawmakers should remove or revise a section in the bill about customer refunds.
“It may have the unintended effect of prohibiting a refund opportunity that currently exists for consumers,” she argued.
The bill allows customers to collect refunds from the date of an Ohio Supreme Court decision rather than the date when charges began. Her office is pursuing refunds right now on behalf of half a million Ohioans who get their power from AES, the company that used to be Dayton Power and Light.
House Bill 15 gives the Public Utility Commission of Ohio a “shot clock” for many of its ratemaking decisions. State Sen. Shane Wilkin, R-Hillsboro, asked about adding one for an annual revision process. The House sponsor, Rep. Roy Klopfenstein, R-Haviland, said he’s willing to consider it. But after the hearing, Chavez said “I don’t know why the PUCO wouldn’t be diligent about it.”
“We’re trying to let everyone do their job without putting too many restrictions on them,” he added, “because everyone wants to do the right thing. So, it’s something that we’ll talk about.”
Chavez acknowledged he scheduled two hearings in case negotiations moved quickly, and they wanted to get the bill to the Senate floor Wednesday. “We prepared for the possibility,” he said. The Committee’s ranking member, Sen. Kent Smith, D-Euclid, added, “Some of it is we want to have conversations with the House.”

(Pool photo by Samantha Madar, Columbus Dispatch.)Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is throwing his support behind a new bill that would require schools to create a policy banning students from using cellphones during the school day. 
State Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, recently introduced Ohio Senate Bill 158, which would ban cellphones in schools. The bill had sponsor testimony Tuesday in the Ohio Senate Education Committee. 
“We need to be sure that our classrooms, frankly, are now cellphone free,” DeWine said. “We all know that screen time is very, very addictive. Just having a phone nearby means students are receiving constant notifications all day long.”

Ohio law currently requires all districts to have a policy for student cellphone use in schools by July 1. Some schools already ban cellphone use, while other schools restrict cellphone use to only certain times of the day. Timken’s bill would take the law a step forward by outright banning the use of cellphones.
“This legislation is a common sense approach to unplug our children from the constant distractions that they have in the classroom,” Timken said. “It will reduce those distractions and allow instructors to facilitate the building of interpersonal relationships that are so vital to human development by eliminating cellphone use in our classrooms.”
A 2024 Pew Research study found that 72% of U.S. high school teachers say cellphone distraction is a major problem in classrooms. Students receive nearly 200 alerts per day on their cellphones, according to Statista. 
“Those notifications make it nearly impossible for students to focus and to learn,” DeWine said. 
He said he has heard positive things from parents, superintendents, principals, and teachers in districts where they have already banned cellphones during the school day.  
“Their kids are focused in the classroom, the lunch room is noisy,” he said. “Once again, kids are actually talking to each other. The kids are actually talking instead of burying their heads and their phones. Grades are better. Socialization is improving and becoming more positive. The number of students being disciplined is down. … The result has been, I think, overwhelmingly indicating that our children in Ohio are better off with no cellphones during the day.”
Timken said the hope is to pass the bill and potentially add it as an amendment to the budget. The Ohio House is expected to vote on the two-year budget Wednesday, sending it over to the Ohio Senate. Under S.B. 158, school districts would have to ban cellphone use by Sept. 1. 
One objection to banning cellphone use is a concern that students won’t be able to reach their parents during an active shooter situation, but Dublin City School District Superintendent John Marschhausen said that would only slow students down from escaping danger.
“If students are given directions and where to go, them looking down at their phones, it only slows the process as to what we’re trying to do, what we’ve practiced when it comes to evacuating, when it comes to lockdown, when it comes to shelter in place,” he said. 
At least 23 states have laws or policies that ban or limit students’ cellphone use in schools, according to Education Week.

(Photo by William F. Zorzi/Maryland Matters)Herbert J. Belgrad wasn’t much of a baseball fan. In fact, he wasn’t really a sports fan at all.
But on April 6, 1992, Belgrad, the first-ever chairman of the Maryland Stadium Authority board, knew he had helped to create something special.
It was the first Opening Day at Oriole Park at Camden Yards, and there sat Belgrad with then-Gov. William Donald Schaefer, watching as the bands played and the fans began to filter into those dark green folding seats. Bruce Hoffman, a former executive director of the authority, recalled the moment.
“I looked at the governor, and the tears were running down his face,” Hoffman said. “He was so freaking happy. And that’s when Herb really took the deep sigh and said: ‘You know, we pulled it off.’”
Belgrad, 90, died Sunday while on his regular morning walk along the Baltimore waterfront in Canton. Family members said he fell into the Patapsco, though they aren’t sure how exactly. They believe it could have been a heart attack, as he had recently developed heart issues.
The city’s Office of the Chief Medical Examiner ruled his death accidental, adding that it was caused by a heart condition, hypertensive atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, and complicated by drowning.
Belgrad was a labor and divorce lawyer who became an architect of the deals that brought the ballpark to life — and ensured the Orioles would remain in Baltimore to play there.
Born in Washington, D.C., Belgrad later attended City College high school in Baltimore and graduated cum laude from Johns Hopkins University, according to an online obituary from his family. A master’s degree from the University of Illinois and a law degree from the University of Maryland would follow.
Belgrad briefly served as an assistant city solicitor, before going into private practice at  Tydings and Rosenberg, where he became a partner. He was there from 1968 until his retirement in 2020.
But it was his volunteer work — especially at the stadium authority, but also with the Maryland State Ethics Commission, local bar associations and Jewish charities — that came to define his career.
Belgrad is survived by his wife of 65 years, Joanne Lott Belgrad, and their three children, Steve Belgrad, Susie Hayes and Leslie Finton, as well as eight grandchildren.

His children said Belgrad worked tirelessly, such that he didn’t have much time for hobbies. But they said he was always there for the important moments in their lives. Hayes said she has fond memories of late nights spent together, after he arrived home from work.
“He would perch at the dining room table, doing his work, and we would come in intermittently to interrupt him,” Hayes said.
Belgrad’s calm nature permeated the household, where loud family fights were practically unheard of, Hayes said. As a lawyer, Belgrad developed a knack for being an adversary without being adversarial.
“So many people, when they negotiate now, especially in business, it’s like a zero-sum game — what someone else wins is what someone else loses,” Steve Belgrad said. “He would come at issues around negotiation and stuff, with sort of an innate sense of fairness, and trying to get to an outcome that was going to be fair to both sides.”
Janet Marie Smith, the Orioles’ in-house architect during the construction of Camden Yards, said that Belgrad was a “pioneer” as the stadium authority’s first board chairman. Driven by immense civic pride rather than love of sport, Belgrad became a steadying hand for high stakes negotiations, which brought the Orioles downtown from the aged Memorial Stadium.
“Herb, as the leader, set a tone for really believing that this project was more than just solving a problem for the baseball team. It was the cornerstone of reinventing Baltimore,” Smith said.
At a critical decision point — deciding whether to keep the B&O Warehouse that became the backbone of Oriole Park — Belgrad was pragmatic rather than emotional, Smith said. He insisted that a study be performed, assessing the economics. Ultimately, the warehouse won out.
“There were many people who thought tearing down the warehouse would be of no consequence, because it was just, well, a warehouse. It wasn’t the U.S. Capitol,” Smith said.
“People were like: ‘Tear that ugly thing down. It’s just going to block the view of the city,’” Steve Belgrad said. “And he was very firm on, that’s what is going to add character.”
As Opening Day neared in 1992, the warehouse still hadn’t been restored. In fact, it looked “bombed out,” Smith said. It was Belgrad and Hoffman who went to the General Assembly and found the funds to rehab the outside, in time for first pitch, Smith said. The interior development came later.
Belgrad was proud to have Camden Yards on the national stage as host for the 1993 All-Star Game. Smith said she believes it helped raise the city’s profile in time to attract the Baltimore Ravens — even if the move came after Belgrad’s tenure as chairman.
Belgrad’s relationships with the General Assembly, Schaefer and even the Orioles were built on trust, said Hoffman, whom Belgrad appointed to serve as the authority’s first executive director.
“People trusted us, and they always trusted Herb,” Hoffman said. “He was just one of those people that you knew he was telling you the truth. And you knew that once he shook your hand, the deal was done.”
Mark Wasserman, a top aide to Schaefer, said that even though Belgrad was appointed board chairman by Gov. Harry R. Hughes, Schaefer opted to keep him around for the stadium project he envisioned transforming Baltimore.
He did so even though Belgrad had supported Schaefer’s opponent for governor, Maryland Attorney General Stephen H. Sachs, Wasserman said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The little blip politically was very quickly put to the side,” Wasserman said.
Once he became board chairman in 1986, he faced complex challenges: Quickly negotiating deals to relocate the commercial bakery, the middle school, the grocer and more that stood on the site of the ballpark. Negotiating a lease with the Orioles. Belgrad spearheaded it all. And in doing so, came to define the role of the stadium authority.
“The challenge was to take something, which was at that point, a shell of an organization — really just a piece of paper — and give it funding and give it direction,” Wasserman said.
Belgrad did just that.
Belgrad also exerted a considerable amount of effort to bring an NFL team to Baltimore, but he knew that memories of the Baltimore Colts’ departure in the middle of the night still stung.
“He was very hesitant to sort of do to another city what happened to Baltimore,” Belgrad said. “And so he focused on trying to get the expansion teams, which didn’t happen.
His children said he was known to wear a pair of sweatpants that advertised the “Baltimore Cardinals,” after an unsuccessful bid to attract the then-St. Louis Cardinals football team to Charm City.
For John Moag, the stadium authority board chairman who came next, Belgrad became a valued confidant.
“Most of the time when we met to talk, I was either asking him for advice, or we were talking about family,” Moag said.
Joe Spear, retired senior principal for architectural firm Populous, which was then HOK Sport, said he remembered Belgrad’s even-keeled nature more than anything.
“He clearly believed that business should be conducted in a normal tone of voice. You disagree, and you might be passionate about it, but there’s no real call to be shouting at somebody,” Spear said.
Belgrad was also disciplined, Spear said. He would host the Orioles, the architects and the stadium authority at his law office for meetings, and he would ensure that lunch was on offer. But not for himself.
“He came in, and he had his brown bag and we’re all eating this catered lunch, and he’s there with his sandwich,” Spear said.
A funeral service for Belgrad will take place Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. at Sol Levinson’s Chapel in Pikesville.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/This-One-IMG_6552-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-09 04:59:45.326522

“My teens use their cell phones for just about everything,” Cincinnati mom Natalie Hastings said.
As smartphones only become more prevalent for kids, schools and parents are trying to crack down on the distractions.
“It’s a very regular part of the routine to give up their phone at the beginning of class,” Hastings added.
She explains that she has boundaries when it comes to cell phone usage — and her school district has too, allowing students to have phones during lunch but not in class.
“It did seem to cut down on some of the, during the day, recording people surreptitiously in the restroom or something,” she continued.
Last year, Gov. Mike DeWine signed a bill into law mandating that every public school district make a policy regarding phone usage in schools. But this year, he wants to go even further.
“Those notifications make it nearly impossible for students to focus and to learn,” DeWine said during a press conference Tuesday.
He and state Sen. Jane Timken, R-Jackson Township, have introduced S.B. 158, which would ban the use of cell phones for students in public schools.
“This legislation is a common sense approach to unplug our children from the constant distractions,” Timken said.
All districts put policies in place to limit phone usage during the day, with some banning them outright. But this bill makes sure that the remaining schools take the summer to create a total prohibition. However, it doesn’t say how they must ban them.
“I don’t understand, will they be in their cars and then they’ll get stolen out?” Hastings said.
Some schools require students to keep their cell phones in magnetically locking “Yondr” bags. Others just collect them in a box at the beginning of class. The mom argues that this is the good thing about local control.
“The local districts know better than the state what’s going to work where they are,” she said.
This could be seen as an unfunded mandate, as Parma Superintendent Charles Smialek said in 2024.
There would be some exceptions, such as if the student has a health concern or if it’s needed for learning disabilities — like under an individualized education program (IEP) or 504 plan.
Although Hastings is generally supportive of the idea of limiting phone use, she can’t help but fear for what happens during an emergency.
“The number one school safety problem is guns, regardless of the type and size of the school,” Hastings said, noting that in the Uvalde shooting in 2022, numerous children called 911 for help as the perpetrator shot 19 students and two teachers — also injuring nearly 20 others. “Phones have been very useful in situations with the shooter threat.”
We asked the governor about this.
“Schools, with advice from experts, have been working very, very hard to have a protocol and to follow that protocol,” the governor responded. “I think most experts look at this and think the use of cell phones many times will interfere with the execution of that protocol.”
Dublin City Schools Superintendent Dr. John Marschhausen explained why he thinks that is.
“If students are given directions on where to go, them looking down at their phones, it only slows the process as to what we’re trying to do,” Marschhausen, the top administrator at the Columbus suburban district, said.
Other parents reached out, and some social media users argue that sending one text to your parent that you are OK or that you love them wouldn’t cause a disaster.
“I am less worried about being able to get in touch with my child,” Hastings said. “I’m more concerned with them being able to get in touch with me.”
Marschhausen also added that there is already a reunification system for families.
“A reunification site only means so much if you can’t reunite with them,” the mother said.
The Senate bill will likely be heard quickly over the coming weeks. However, a provision was added to the House’s proposed budget that may pass the House Wednesday.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The Trump administration has warned that several groups want to take many things away from white, working-class Americans: their jobs, their belief that there are only two genders, and their right to go to libraries with books that exclude almost everyone except them.
The administration usually refers to these “others” with collective nouns. Immigrants, LGBTQs, minorities. The vilification of DEI programs primarily focuses on such groups, but it encompasses more.
My concern is that people with disabilities will be the next targets.
Until the 1970s, those with disabilities were usually referred to by collective nouns. “The mentally ill,” “the retarded,” “the handicapped.” Such terminology turns a group into an “other,” with members who are not like us — perhaps less than human. The “otherness” gives rise to stereotypes and misinformation.
Unlike some “others,” people with disabilities haven’t been the subject of dislike or hatred for most of our country’s history, in part because they were mostly invisible. If they were mentally disabled, they were sent to institutions. The intent was to give them asylum from the chaos of modern life; the effect was to separate them from the community, often for the rest of their lives. If they were physically disabled, they couldn’t enter most buildings. Architects designed buildings without elevators or ramps, but not because they didn’t want people in wheelchairs to enter the building. They didn’t think about “the crippled” at all.
Spurred on by the civil rights movement, those with disabilities and their advocates pushed for laws prohibiting discrimination based on disability. Two federal laws (Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act) prohibit discrimination based on disability in several areas, including employment, education and public accommodations. Neither law requires affirmative action. Both require that a qualified disabled person may be entitled to reasonable accommodation (such as installing ramps at a building’s entrance, making doorways and toilets accessible to people in wheelchairs, or allowing service animals in a building that prohibits all animals) to give them the equal opportunity to that of nondisabled people.
I am not aware of any evidence that disabled people take away jobs from nondisabled workers, groom children to become disabled or force nondisabled schoolchildren to feel guilty about our country’s history of mistreatment of “the handicapped.” But in what appears to be an increasingly fact-free political environment, it’s possible that the disabled community could be targeted as the next “other,” subject to social media attacks and cutbacks to governmental funding and legal protections.
Perhaps the attack will be that many mentally ill people commit heinous crimes or that the mentally ill homeless are soiling our cities and panhandling citizens for money to buy drugs and alcohol. Both attacks are based on stereotypes: mentally ill people are more likely to be victims of crime than perpetrators. It is estimated that less than a third of homeless people have severe mental illness.
The problems of crime and homelessness are too complex to be blamed solely on mental disability.
In September 2024, 17 state attorneys general filed a lawsuit against the Secretary of Health and Human Services over a regulation stating that “gender dysphoria” should be considered a disability under Section 504. One count of the complaint stated that Section 504 should be declared unconstitutional.
In response to reaction from several groups, the plaintiffs stated it was not their intention to repeal Section 504. While the attack on Section 504 seemed to be an afterthought in this case, it may not be the last.
There is a difference between the current “others” and people with disabilities. The status of disability is not always fixed at birth. While there are some disabilities that are present then, many more disabilities are acquired at various stages in life: from an accident, illness or act of violence. Many people who are now not disabled may become disabled later in life. Those people decrying the presence of various groups in this country may never be an immigrant, a member of the LGBQT+ community, or a member of a minority race. But they may someday become disabled.
Would they want to say a litany that includes: “Then they came for the disabled, and I did not speak out because I was not disabled”?

Gov. DeWine’s cannabis, gambling, and tobacco tax increases were out, and his proposed child tax credit was removed. The bill also included tax cuts for coal mining, a new tax expenditure to support anti-abortion advocacy centers, and many other changes to tax, budget, and other policy areas.
Maybe the most historic change introduced in the new bill, however, was a proposal to eliminate the state’s public library fund, which has funded Ohio’s library system for the past 100 years.
To be clear, this is not a total elimination of public library support, just the fund. The new bill folds the special line item into the state’s general revenue fund. The proposed House budget still provides public library funding from the general revenue fund, though it does cut the governor’s proposal to fund libraries by 9% — a $100 million reduction.
Ohio ranks near the middle of the pack on a lot of metrics. Its library system is not one of those. Ohioans visit their libraries 3.41 times a year on average — second highest among all states across the country. The average Ohioan checks out over 12 books a year — more than any other state in the country. Two-thirds of Ohioans have a library card, which puts it second among states in that category.
In the early days of my firm Scioto Analysis, I pondered a lot about market failure. Okay, I still do, but at the time I had a lot fewer clients to keep me occupied. I recall being on the phone with my benefit-cost analysis professor from graduate school asking him what services libraries provide to correct market failures.

At the time, I was very focused on circulation: how does provision of books help correct market failures?
What I missed at the time was right in front of me. I built Scioto Analysis at the library. I would bike there daily to have a place to work away from home. I would reserve conference rooms so I had places where I could have in-person or online meetings. I used their computers to do work and had a place to print RFP responses — a nice resource for someone who hasn’t owned a printer in years.
Entrepreneurs aren’t the only people who benefit from libraries. A study out this year in the American Economic Journal found investments in public libraries lead to increased test scores for children who lived nearby. This means libraries are also helping build tomorrow’s workforce.
Economist Howard Fleeter estimates Ohio’s libraries provided physical and electronic circulation, computer and technology services, reference services, programs, and other services to the tune of a total value of $3.1 billion in 2019. Comparing this to the total operating cost of the system of $780 million, Fleeter estimates the system generates about $4 in economic benefits for every $1 in operating expenses.
There are certainly other benefits to public libraries. Services to low-income people and people struggling with housing security, as a place for children to spend time after school, and civic benefits from people having a place to be around others free of charge are all values of the library. The economic benefits are real, however, and they could be threatened by proposed cuts at the state level.

Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
Measles outbreak mounts among children in one of Texas’ least vaccinated counties

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
 Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
 State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Flu deaths rise as anti-vaccine disinformation takes root

Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Bruce A. Lewandowski, an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Baltimore with a passion for social justice, was officially introduced Tuesday as the next bishop of the Archdiocese of Providence, R.I.","The Most Rev. Bruce A. Lewandowski speaks to reporters inside the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul in Providence, R.I., on Tuesday, after Pope Francis announced that Lewandowski would become the 10th bishop of the Diocese of Providence. (Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)When the first Trump administration planned a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants six years ago, the Most Rev. Bruce A. Lewandowski, an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Baltimore, spoke out.
“If something is wrong, it’s up to the church to speak out,” Lewandowski told reporters Tuesday. “To be human is to be political, right?”
His comments came Tuesday morning as Lewandowski was formally introduced as Pope Francis’ pick as the 10th bishop of the Diocese of Providence (R.I.) at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul — a little more than five months after his predecessor left to lead the Archdiocese of Boston.
Lewandowski will officially be installed to his new duties May 20. Lewandowski is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, something he was quick to showcase during his Rhode Island introduction. He was often brought to tears as he spoke in Spanish.
“Con más de 30 años sirviendo a la comunidad Hispana, es mi vida,” he said. (“With more than 30 years serving the Hispanic community, this is my life.”)
A native of Toledo, Ohio, Lewandowski grew up on a farm before being ordained a priest in 1994 in Washington D.C. He did missionary work in the Caribbean and was a pastor in the Bronx and Philadelphia before serving in Baltimore.
He succeeds the Most Rev. Richard Henning, who was selected by Pope Francis last August to lead the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. Henning commended Lewandowski’s appointment to his former diocese.
“I have a deep love for that diocese and its people, and I am grateful that the Holy Father has chosen a joyful and energetic young bishop who speaks Spanish and Portuguese and has experience in pastoral planning,” he said in a statement. “I wish Bishop Bruce Lewandowski every blessing as he exercises his ministry in the state of hope!”
Henning was on the job for a little over a year, himself succeeding the ever outspoken Thomas Tobin in May 2023. Tobin often used social media to share his unapologetic stance against abortion and same-sex marriage.
Henning, meanwhile, tried to stay out of politics — save for using the influence of the diocese to push for a ban on assault-style weapons and raising his pro-life stance.
Lewandowski has been especially vocal against mass deportations conducted by the Trump administration, which he compared to “an act of domestic terrorism” in 2019. His stance has not softened since then.
“A humane enforcement of immigration laws that respects the dignity of every person is what’s in order, “ Lewandowski told reporters Monday. “Rounding up people, using fear and manipulation as a tactic to drive people away, the politics of harassment — I don’t think there’s a place for that, it doesn’t go with the way Jesus treated people.”
Pope Francis too has been critical of Trump’s immigration policies. He sent a letter to U.S. bishops on Feb. 10 saying that criminalizing undocumented immigrants and taking measures built on force “will end badly.”
The church has historically advocated for the rights and dignity of everyone, Lewandowski said.
“Every person reflects the image and likeness of God,” he said. “We’re here to protect, defend and care for and nurture that in every single person — man, woman and child — from conception to natural death.”
‘Heaven on Earth’
Lewandowski, 57, received the news about his new job on March 29 while driving around “the wilds of Maryland.”
He said he received a call from the apostolic nuncio to the United States asking one question: Was he alone? After confirming he was, Lewandowski was told he was moving to Rhode Island.
He said Tuesday he was still in disbelief that he was chosen to serve in “a beautiful place” such as Rhode Island.
“I think it’s a piece of Heaven on Earth,” he said.
As he assumes the role of bishop, Lewandowski said he intends to meet people wherever they are at — especially if there’s a meal involved.
“I love to eat,” he said. “I’ve been accused of begging but I love ice cream, chocolate, cake, cookies, pies, I have a terrible sweet tooth — I’m surprised I have any teeth left.”

Brian Kemp to veto a bill that increased needs-based grants for college students. Kemp signed dozens of new laws and vetoed 14 bills in 2023. File photo by Ross Williams/Georgia RecorderThe Georgia General Assembly concluded its 2025 legislative session on Friday with the passage of roughly 400 bills and resolutions combined.
The abrupt end of the session gave way to a 40-day window that runs through May 14 when Gov. Brian Kemp can veto or sign legislation, or do nothing and automatically let it become law.
The last day of the session, when House and Senate lawmakers usually crank out legislation right up until midnight and celebrate at the end of the night by throwing torn-up pieces of paper into the air, was unexpectedly cut short.
In previous years, the Republican governor has vetoed about 10 bills each year, signed hundreds of pieces of legislation into law, and hosted a few ceremonies to ink some noteworthy bills with a keepsake pen. Last year, Kemp vetoed a dozen bills.
Kemp signed six bills before the General Assembly’s final gavel of fell, including a controversial so-called religious freedom bill.
Kemp is expected to hold a public ceremony prior to May 14 to sign his priority legislation for 2025 that is intended to limit the amount of damages juries award in civil lawsuits.
Kemp successfully fought off robust opposition to the civil litigation overhaul outlined in Senate Bill 68 and the more narrowly written Senate Bill 69 that requires transparency when third-party groups finance civil suits.
Kemp will also have the opportunity to publicly sign off on a school safety plan in the wake of September’s deadly shooting at Barrow County’s Apalachee High School. That high-profile measure creates deadlines to transfer student records to new school districts, establishes a statewide school threat alert system and requires Georgia schools to install panic buttons.
Kemp will also decide how he will handle a slate of culture war bills, including a ban on transgender athletes in girls’ sports in K-12 and college and another measure banning gender-affirming care in the state’s prisons.
Culture war issues, including new restrictions on transgender Americans, have been a priority of Republican President Donald Trump’s administration since he took office in January.
Georgia’s legislative smorgasbord awaiting Kemp includes next year’s nearly $38 billion budget as well as the accelerated income tax cut he championed and one-time income tax refunds set to be distributed to Georgia taxpayers later this year.
Usually, a statement from Kemp’s office explains why he vetoed a particular measure.

Wes Moore adds his signature to prescription drug affordability legislation passed by the General Assembly, it will highlight how his values on this life-saving issue contrast with those of his predecessor, Larry Hogan, writes Vincent DeMarco.","Ceremonial pens staged for the first of five bill signings after the 2025 session of the General Assembly. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)When Gov. Wes Moore adds his expected signature to landmark prescription drug affordability legislation passed by the General Assembly, it will highlight how his values on this life-saving issue are in stark contrast to those of his predecessor, Larry Hogan.
From the beginning of his tenure, Moore worked to empower Maryland’s first-in-the-nation Prescription Drug Affordability Board (PDAB).  By contrast, Hogan undermined and hindered the PDAB’s work.
In 2019, the Maryland General Assembly, led by Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), now chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee, passed legislation creating the PDAB. Hogan neither signed nor vetoed it, letting it become law without his signature.
But the next year, when the General Assembly passed legislation to fund the PDAB, Hogan vetoed it. Although the General Assembly overrode this veto the following year, Hogan’s callous action delayed its work. Further, Hogan slow-walked key appointments to the PDAB and its Stakeholder Council, which also hurt the PDAB’s ability to operate.

Under the original 2019 law, the PDAB was supposed to set up a process for making high-cost drugs more affordable for the state government and local governments by the end of 2022; the General Assembly would then decide in 2023 whether to authorize the PDAB to help all Marylanders afford their drugs. But, because of Hogan’s roadblocks, the PDAB could not meet this timeline and, therefore, the General Assembly did not act to expand the board’s authority that year.
Then Moore came to the rescue. In his inaugural address, he said it was a priority to ensure all Marylanders have quality, affordable health care. He knows that this cannot be done without making high-cost prescription drugs more affordable.
Many Marylanders have trouble affording life-saving drugs, forced to choose between purchasing their medications or paying for other necessities of life. But additionally, high drug costs affect all of us, as we are forced to pay higher health insurance premiums. The large drug corporations argue they need to charge these outrageous prices, which are much higher than anywhere else in the world, to fund research. But the truth is that big Pharma spends far more on advertising and profits than on research.
In 2023, working with the General Assembly, Moore allocated a critical $1 million for the PDAB, which helped jump-start its work after Hogan’s veto had stalled it. The governor knew the state would recoup that money many times over from saving money on high-cost drugs. The governor and General Assembly also passed new legislation confirming the PDAB’s authority to help state and local governments afford their drugs.
This board’s hard work and support from Gov. Moore are starting to pay off. Under the leadership of Chair Van Mitchell and Executive Director Andrew York, the PDAB is poised this year to make high-cost drugs more affordable for the state government and local governments, saving Maryland taxpayers millions of dollars.
Based on this, and with the support of the Moore administration, the General Assembly, led by Dels. Bonnie Cullison (D-Montgomery) and Jennifer White Holland (D-Baltimore Coutny) and Sens. Dawn Gile (D-Anne Arundel) and Brian Feldman (D-Montgomery), just passed legislation expanding the authority of the PDAB so it can help all Marylanders afford their high-cost drugs. The governor has pledged to sign this measure into law.
Wes Moore is not the only governor with the courage to stand up to the drug corporations. Following Maryland’s lead, Govs. Jared Polis of Colorado, Tim Walz of Minnesota and Jay Inslee of Washington signed strong PDAB laws in their states.  Unfortunately, one governor, Glenn Youngkin of Virginia, outdid Larry Hogan by actually vetoing a PDAB bill.
We are very proud of the progress we are making in Maryland under Gov. Moore to make high-cost drugs more affordable. This is critical because drugs don’t work if people can’t afford them. We encourage other governors around the country to follow Governor Moore’s example.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0089-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-09 01:23:01.132484

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters).Jessica Brady Reader and Lauren Petit told lawmakers the heart-wrenching stories of  their experiences with stillbirth and the emotional and financial toll it takes on a family, urging support for a bill that would grant a $1,000 tax credit to such families.
Reader felt that members of the House Ways and Means Committee were sympathetic to the issue, and she was hopeful for the bill’s chances. But the measure never got a committee vote, which Reader attributes to lawmakers having to prioritize other legislation as the end of session neared.
“I am disappointed the bill did not become law, but I am definitely not defeated,” said Reader, a Kensington resident who is already planning to be back in the legislature next year to lobby the issue
She is one of the many advocates who work long hours to push for bills every year that they believe will help their lives or the lives of fellow Marylanders — only to watch their work of days, months, sometimes years fall by the wayside as their bills die.
And just as many are quick to begin work for the next session. Reader had already committed herself to 2026 less than 24 hours after the end of the 2025 legislature.
“I am very proud that, if nothing else, we’re able to raise awareness through our advocacy this year,” Reader said.

Some advocates, like Reader and Petit, can only standby as their issues do not come up for a vote. Others saw their bills pass, but in a form they did not like. Still others have been fighting for years to see their proposals advance, but not far enough to become law.
For Matt Losak, executive director of the Montgomery County Renters Alliance, 2025 was the latest in more than a decade of unsuccessful attempts to pass so-called Good Cause evictions legislation.
He said advocates plan to be back next session to give the bill another run, after Senate Bill 651 stalled in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee right before the crossover deadline this year.
Losak said that the Good Cause legislation is desperately needed to protect renters, by requiring that landlords cite a specific reason when they do not renew a lease with a current tenant. The bill that failed this year would have allowed local jurisdictions to adopt such eviction policies.
“It is the essential legislation that will protect tens of thousands of Marylanders from unfair eviction. Even though it has not succeeded year after year, what has happened is it has succeeded in getting greater attention and greater support,” Losak said.
Forever battle against ‘forever chemicals’
Environmentalists at the Potomac Riverkeeper Network were “deeply frustrated and disappointed” about the failure of legislation to restrict PFAS chemicals, so-called “forever chemicals” for their extreme persistence in the environment. They are already planning to be back next year.
One bill would have limited the concentration of certain PFAS chemicals in the biosolids that come from wastewater treatment plants, and are often spread on farm fields. The bill did not get out of committee, in the face of opposition from wastewater treatment plant operators, but it is still desperately needed said Betsy Nicholas, the Potomac Riverkeeper Network’s, in a statement.
Nicholas said she looks forward to working with the bill’s sponsors, Del. Dana Stein (D-Baltimore County) and Sen. Sara Love (D-Montgomery), as well as the state Department of the Environment, to regulate PFAS in biosolids “through a combination of regulations and legislation.”
“There was too much agreement from too many stakeholders to walk away from the concept,” wrote Evan Isaacson, a senior attorney for the Chesapeake Legal Alliance.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The nonprofit ShoreRivers also plans to keep advocating for the bill, as well as additional bans on PFAS — a shorthand for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — in consumer products, said Matt Pluta, the Choptank Riverkeeper and director of riverkeeper programs at the organization.
“The lack of progress on this year’s bill means continued use of PFAS-laden biosolids with no end date in site, which will further contaminate local groundwater and surface waters,” Pluta said in a statement. “This, in turn, increases health risks from contaminated drinking water, local seafood, and wild game.”
Another PFAS bill did advance — but not in the direction advocates wanted. They initially supported a bill banning certain PFAS from pesticides in Maryland, but pulled their support when lawmakers narrowed the definition of PFAS frustrating groups like Maryland’s Smart on Pesticides Coalition, who feared that it would loosen PFAS regulation elsewhere in the state.
“There will be conversations in the interim to figure out what the best way to move forward is. We want those important conversations to happen before making any decisions on next session,” said Bonnie Raindrop, the group’s coordinator.
Immigrant advocates said they also plan to come back next year after an emotional evening on the last day of the legislature when lawmakers pushed through migrant protections at the last minute, but stripped out one of the strongest protections — a prohibition on so-called 287(g) agreements between county police and federal immigration officials. Critics say the agreements allow local police to essentially act in an immigration capacity.
“We’ll be back next year — stronger, more organized and committed to ending 287(g),” said Cathryn Jackson, policy director for CASA, in a text Tuesday. “Every day this program stays in place, more families are harmed and the urgency for action increases.”
Members of Maryland’s immigrant populations had high hopes for House Bill 1222, which would have restricted 287(g) agreements. Lawmakers wound up adding other protections to the bill — to safeguard immigrants’ personal data and limit immigration agents authority in spaces like churches and schools. But with the clock ticking on the session, they stripped out 287(g) language as they rushed to pass a watered-down bill in the face of the Trump administration’s mass deportations.
Lawmakers pass watered-down immigrant protections bill in final minutes of 2025 session

Jackson said it was “deeply disappointing” that lawmakers, particularly in the Senate, “didn’t rise to the moment” and restrict 287(g) agreements this session, but said that the fight is “far from over.”
“We’re not going anywhere,” she said.
A second look at the Second Look Act
Another bill that advocates said was watered down was the Second Look Act, which would allow some people who served at least 20 years in prison to petition the court for a reduced sentence. That person couldn’t be convicted a sex offender and cannot have been sentenced without the possibility of parole.
After years of trying, House Bill 853, sponsored by Del. Cheryl Pasteur (D-Baltimore County), passed this year and is now before the governor. But advocates are upset by a last-minute Senate amendment that makes the law unavailable to anyone convicted of killing a first responder.
The bill also narrowed Pasteur’s previously submitted bills by make the law available only to those convicted of a crime they committed between the ages of 18 to 25, which would be about 350 people.
Yanet Amanuel, public policy director for the ACLU of Maryland, said individuals sentenced to life without parole should not have been excluded.
“Some of the most deserving people to receive a second chance are those serving LWOP [life without parole] sentences,” Amanuel said Tuesday. “People do change after 20 years. There are very deserving people who have been rehabilitated and…had mentors of people who were inside [prison].”
For advocates like Reader, each attempt is another chance to push their issue forward until, one day, their bill becomes law.
“This one didn’t quite make it across the finish line this time,” Reader said. “But we had gotten such positive feedback both in the Senate and the House when we testified, so I am pretty confident that we’ll be able to grow our support next session.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/2025_feb18_renterrally_goodcause2-newsletter-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-09 01:23:01.132484

(Photo by Corinne Smith/Alaska Beacon)As Alaska faces economic shocks from a tumbling stock market and an unstable oil market, leaders of the state House of Representatives are appealing to minority-caucus members and Gov. Mike Dunleavy to help balance the budget.
“Ladies and gentlemen, we’re all in a pickle,” House Speaker Bryce Edgmon, I-Dillingham said in a news conference on Tuesday. “It’s not just the House majority: It’s the House minority; it’s the governor; it’s the Senate majority; it’s the Senate minority. We all own the situation in front of us.”
The House Finance Committee passed a budget on Thursday that includes $1.9 billion more in spending for the 12 months that begin in July than the state is forecast to raise. But Edgmon said that committee would continue to work on the bill to try to bring it into balance, as required by state law. 
Edgmon, I-Dillingham, noted that the budget faces several challenges, including oil prices dropping over the past week. And he said the 21-19 split in the House meant that any one member has a veto power to block legislation. The House majority consists of 14 Democrats, five independents and two Republicans, while the minority has 19 Republicans.
“We need to work together,” Edgmon said of the House minority, before addressing the governor’s office: “Please step up. Work with us. We’ll get through this. But if you leave us to our own designs, we are going to be stuck in this morass that unfortunately will carry forward into what none of us want: And that’s a special session.”
Two majority finance committee members — Rep. Neal Foster, D-Nome, and Nellie Unangiq Jimmie, D-Bethel — support Permanent Fund dividends at the level set under the formula in current law, which would be around $3,800 per resident and cost $2.46 billion. That size would make a balanced budget impossible without new taxes or significant draws from savings.
The value of the Alaska Permanent Fund fell by $3.2 billion, and Alaska North Slope oil fell from $76 per barrel to $65, in the days after President Donald Trump announced new tariffs. 
Before the majority news conference, the House minority held one of their own. Finance committee members Rep. DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, and Will Stapp, R-Fairbanks, both said the draft budget must be reduced. They raised the possibility of reexamining any new programs or positions that were added in the current budget, which started last July, or were proposed in the draft budget, including a hotly debated education funding increase.
“It’s hard work,” Johnson. “It’s drudgery. … It’s not one of those things you approach with a lot of excitement. You have to approach that with a lot of work.”
Stapp questioned the affordability of the proposed increase in the funding per student in public education. House Bill 69 includes a $1,000 per student increase in the base student allocation, the core of the state’s funding formula. For the next school year, that BSA increase would equal $253 million.
“Ultimately, you’re going to have to take the education funding level and say, you want to prioritize education, but you probably can’t do a $1,000 BSA,” Stapp said. He said the increase should look more like the one-time boost in state funding for the current school year, which was $680 per student. In terms of the total budget, that education funding increase was $174 million, compared with the $253 million in the draft proposal.
In the majority news conference, leaders of that caucus took a different view.
Majority Leader Chuck Kopp, R-Anchorage, said legislators shouldn’t even be raising the possibility of a Permanent Fund dividend using the formula in current law.
“I ran and campaigned on a balanced budget,” Kopp said, adding that he would have joined the other caucus if it agreed to a balanced budget and what he described as “the dividend we can afford.”
Kopp also emphasized that the majority is not proposing paying for a larger dividend with legislation to increase taxes or other revenue. He rejected increasing oil taxes, saying that the industry is still rebounding from the COVID-19 pandemic and he doesn’t want to discourage investment in future development.
Finance committee co-chair Andy Josephson, D-Anchorage, said the draft budget includes some growth driven by necessity. As an example, he cited funding for child advocacy centers to interview children who have been sexually abused.  And he noted that most of the increase in the budget was proposed by Dunleavy, with additions for public employee contract increases. 
Josephson described the education funding increase as a “core principle.”
“We heard from scores of Anchorage citizens about the importance of that, and we have their back,” he said. “Come hell or high water, we’re going to stand for that principle.”
The legislative session is scheduled to end by May 21. Special sessions have been called in 2017 and 2021 to avoid partial state government shutdowns, which would occur if there isn’t a budget enacted by June 30.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Tuesday protecting coal and overhauling the Biden Administration’s sweeping rules that aimed to reduce carbon emissions from coal power plants. 
Titled “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry,” the order directs his cabinet to move fast to increase coal-powered energy production in the country and to undo federal regulatory barriers that may prevent that task ahead of the anticipated rise of energy-hungry artificial intelligence centers and manufacturing activity.
“We’re slashing unnecessary regulations that targeted the beautiful clean coal. We will rapidly expedite leases for coal mining on federal lands (…) and we’ll streamline permitting,” Trump said during the announcement on Tuesday. “We will end the government bias against coal, and we’re going to unlock the sweeping authorities of defense production Act, the defense production act to turbocharge coal mining in America.”

While coal is a rock, not a mineral, the White House also required the National Energy Dominance Council to designate coal as a mineral so that it’s covered by the protections established by a March executive order that creates a process to expedite mineral production projects in the country and allow leases for mineral extraction on public lands.
The executive order received applause from Republican lawmakers and coal miners who posed in the background as Trump announced the anticipated measures. Utah Republican Sen. Mike Lee showed his enthusiasm for Trump’s order, making multiple posts on X from his seat at the signing event. 
“Biden sought energy subservience. Trump wants dominance,” Lee wrote on X, quoting a post from Vivek Ramaswamy that read “Energy dominance is a requirement for manufacturing dominance.”
Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’

However, environmental and clean energy advocates were dismayed to hear the news, not only because of what it would mean for carbon emissions in the country.
Sarah Wright, CEO of Utah Clean Energy, said the executive order paints a false narrative that having an affordable, reliable energy system can’t happen at the same time that leaders address the consequences of climate change.
“The United States can be ‘energy dominant’ by investing in the next generation of energy resources. Wind, solar, geothermal, and storage represent the future and incredible opportunities for the U.S. to lead,” Wright wrote in a statement. “This executive order is firmly rooted in the past, setting the U.S. up to fall further behind countries like China that are leading in clean energy technology development and associated economic opportunities.”
The Sierra Club also wrote in a news release that alongside tariffs that would reverse renewable energy efforts, Trump’s policies are expected to raise monthly energy bills for Americans, since renewable energy can be 30% cheaper than coal. With increased carbon emissions, also come public health consequences, including respiratory and heart conditions, Sierra Club leaders said.
“This is the latest move in a pattern to force a plan that simply isn’t economical, and these orders won’t change that,” Luis Miranda, Sierra Club Utah senior organizer, said in a statement. “What they will do is delay a meaningful energy transition that could protect workers and create long-term, good-paying jobs. This band-aid approach does nothing but buy time from a clock that’s already run out.”



Let us know what you think...


 


The order, however, is in line with Utah’s energy policy, where there were already steps to facilitate coal-powered energy production. Utah Republican lawmakers have often referred to coal as an important component of their “all-of-the-above” energy strategy and have passed laws that, in essence, are meant to protect coal as other states make moves to adopt clean energy resources and phase out fossil fuels.
Rocky Mountain Power, Utah’s largest electric utility, also has plans to keep operating its two coal plants, Hunter and Huntington, indefinitely, eliminating their 2032 retirement plans. 
The executive order is hardly a surprise. Trump had already made clear his intentions to boost energy production and to “drill, baby, drill” since his inaugural speech. On Tuesday, he also referred to the Green New Deal, the Biden Administration’s flagship set of policies to address climate change, as the “green new scam” and took a jab again at the Paris Agreement, an international treaty to combat climate change that Trump ordered the U.S. to withdraw from. 
PacifiCorp extends the life of Utah coal-powered plants — indefinitely

Trump also signed another order on Tuesday titled “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” an action that requires the removal of “all illegitimate impediments” to developing coal and other resources, including oil, natural gas, hydropower, geothermal, biofuel, critical minerals and nuclear energy resources. 
“Many States have enacted, or are in the process of enacting, burdensome and ideologically motivated ‘climate change’ or energy policies that threaten American energy dominance and our economic and national security,” the order reads, pointing to policy examples in New York, Vermont and California. 
Trump argued that clean energy efforts from those states influence the whole country and undermine federalism. So, he ordered the U.S. Attorney General to identify any state laws “purporting to address ‘climate change’ or involving ‘environmental, social, and governance’ initiatives, ‘environmental justice,’ carbon or ‘greenhouse gas’ emissions, and funds to collect carbon penalties or carbon taxes,” and to take action to stop their enforcement.
“These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration’s objective to unleash American energy,” Trump wrote in the order. “They should not stand.”

Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images.An Iowa ag company accused of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme is being sued by a lender that says 110,000 piglets are at risk of starvation.
Compeer Financial of Minnesota is suing Sunterra Farms Iowa Inc., Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. in U.S. District Court. Compeer alleges that the three defendants operate extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, and have granted Compeer, their lender, exclusive security over their collective assets.
Compeer is asking the court to appoint a receiver to take control of the defendants’ assets so that Compeer can protect its collateral by continuing to provide for the feeding and care of 110,000 head of swine.
The defendant companies are allegedly operated by the Price family of South Dakota, including Ray, Art and Glen Price, who own and manage 110,000 head of swine in 54 barns located in and around Yankton County, South Dakota. The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra.
Compeer claims in the lawsuit that because of what it calls “the long-running fraud” perpetrated by the defendant companies, they cannot be trusted to operate their businesses and protect their assets, including the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County.
According to the lawsuit, the three defendant companies have engaged in check kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.
Compeer’s lawsuit claims that earlier this year, the defendant companies were issuing each other numerous checks, in nearly identical amounts, on a daily basis — with some checks ranging from $800,000 to $990,000, an amount just below the threshold that would trigger scrutiny from regulators.
The transactions had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest, the lawsuit claims.
Compeer alleges that on Feb. 12, 2025, the day after it asked Ray Price, the CEO of the defendant companies, about the transactions, it received a batch of checks totaling $9 million drawn one of the defendants’ Canadian bank accounts for deposit into the defendants’ account with Compeer.
Later that day, the lawsuit claims, Ray Price admitted that the checks were intended only to prevent the Compeer account from being overdrawn, and acknowledged that if Compeer attempted to deposit the $9 million it would trigger a corresponding overdraft in the Canadian account. According to the lawsuit, Price admitted that what the companies were doing was “wrong.”
About 24 hours later, the lawsuit claims, Price spoke to Compeer personnel and said the Canadian account was overdrawn by roughly $21 million, adding that he needed Compeer to immediately “send the money back” to the Canadian bank to cover the overdraft. Compeer refused.
In late February, the lawsuit alleges, Compeer learned the Canadian bank had rejected 65 checks totaling $59.9 million previously credited by Compeer to the defendants’ accounts. As a result, the defendants’ $21 million positive cash balance at Compeer was instantly wiped out and replaced with a $36 million debt owed by the defendants to Compeer.
In its lawsuit, Compeer alleges that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions.
Court records show that on March 17, 2025, the Canadian bank asked that a receiver be appointed to look after the defendants’ assets. However, the listed assets in that case didn’t include the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County, or the 370,000 head owned by third parties and managed by Sunterra.
In court filings, Compeer says that over the past several weeks, it has provided funds necessary for the care and feeding of the Yankton County pigs, but says it is no longer willing to do so “while the parties who perpetrated this fraudulent scheme” remain in control of Sunterra, Sunwold and Lariagra.
“These swine are in imminent danger of starvation if feed is not promptly purchased and delivered to barns housing the pigs,” the lawsuit states, adding that workers hired to provide for the animals’ care may soon walk off the job given the Price family’s inability to make payroll.
If court appoints a receiver, Compeer states in its court filings, it will advance the money necessary to protect its collateral and prevent the animals’ starvation.
The Price family has not yet responded to the lawsuit and Sunserra declined comment. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for fraud and unjust enrichment. The lawsuit was initially filed in South Dakota state court before being transferred to federal court.

Maria Cantwell has emerged as a leading voice in Congress opposing President Donald Trump’s universal tariffs announced last week.
Her new bipartisan legislation to give Congress more authority over trade policy has more than half a dozen Republican cosponsors in the U.S. Senate. 
And on Tuesday, Cantwell was one of many senators who grilled the president’s top trade advisor after days of stock market turmoil, anxiety over the price of goods, and growing concerns about the country plunging into a recession.
“I represent a trade economy,” Cantwell told U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer. “I represent the success of what innovation and trade gets you. 
“You’re coming here telling me that tariff is the tool,” added the Democratic senator from Edmonds. “And I’m telling you innovation is the tool.”
Trump’s broad new tariffs, including 10% import taxes across the board and much higher rates on many other countries, are set to go into effect Wednesday. Some countries, including China, retaliated, or threatened to retaliate, with tariffs of their own. The president hopes the levies will boost domestic industrial production after decades of outsourcing.
After a strong start Tuesday, the S&P 500 was down over 1.5% at market close, despite signs the Trump administration could be open to negotiations on tariffs. The index has dropped nearly 11% in the past five days.
Back in this Washington, Republicans in Olympia said the tariffs, widely believed to drive up prices for consumers, are a matter of “some short-term pain for long-term gain.”
“I don’t claim to be an economic genius in any way, shape or form, but I’m going to wait and see,” state Sen. Keith Wagoner, R-Sedro-Woolley, told reporters Tuesday. “And hopefully it will land on the right place.”
But industry leaders here are worried tariffs will deal a debilitating blow to the state economy. 
And last week, Gov. Bob Ferguson called the tariffs “a direct threat to affordability and prosperity for families, communities, and businesses across Washington state.”
“It’s time for the president to step back from the brink of economic turmoil, and for the Congress to reassert its authority over trade policy,” he said.
The legislation
Cantwell’s bill seeks to add guardrails on the president’s trade power.
“As representatives of the American people, Congress has a duty to stop actions that will cause them harm,” she said in a statement.
The legislation, spearheaded along with Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley from Iowa, requires the president to notify Congress of the imposition or increase in a tariff within 48 hours. The notice must explain the rationale behind the levy and analyze how it could impact the country’s businesses and consumers.
Within 60 days, Congress would have to pass a joint resolution approving the new tariff, or it would expire. And Congress could end tariffs at any time via resolution.
Article 1 of the U.S. Constitution says Congress “shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises” and “to regulate Commerce with foreign Nations.”
The bill, called the Trade Review Act of 2025, is modeled after the War Powers Resolution of 1973, a bipartisan law that aimed to stop presidents from going to war without congressional consent. Congress had to override then-President Richard Nixon’s veto to pass the law near the end of the Vietnam War.
On Tuesday, Cantwell castigated Greer for the Trump administration not preparing Congress for the emergency tariffs.
She said Trump “could have opened these conversations with these countries without the tariffs, and saved a lot of people a lot of pain and anguish.”
The bill has garnered some bipartisan support in the Senate and endorsements from retail and business trade groups.
An identical bill in the House has also earned some Republican backing, including central Washington Rep. Dan Newhouse, his spokesperson confirmed Tuesday.
But the proposal has little chance of being enshrined in law, as Speaker of the House Mike Johnson has said Congress would be hands-off as Trump implements widespread tariffs. Senate Majority Leader John Thune, of South Dakota, has said the idea doesn’t have a chance.
And the White House has said Trump would veto the bill if it reached his desk.
The fallout for Washington state
With about $60 billion in annual international exports, Washington is one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation. Two out of every five jobs in the state are linked to international trade, officials say.
“Washington state stands to lose among the most from Trump’s destructive trade war,” Sen. Patty Murray said on a press call.
For example, Trump imposed a 24% tariff on goods from Japan, potentially straining the relationship with Washington’s biggest destination for exported processed potatoes. 
The state is a top producer of apples, blueberries, hops, pears, spearmint oil and cherries, exports of which could also be targeted for retaliatory tariffs, said Lori Otto Punke, the president of the Washington Council on International Trade. 
Washington’s farmers have been here before. A tariff tug-of-war started during the first Trump administration forced Washington’s apple exports to India to plummet. Cherry exports to China also dropped precipitously due to tariffs.
A rising concern is budding anti-American sentiment among what used to be trade allies, like Canada, the top importer of Washington agricultural products, said Rianne Ham, of the state Department of Agriculture. Trust will be broken in trade relationships that took years to foster, she added.
State Commerce Director Joe Nguyen told reporters that tariffs on key trade partners like India, Vietnam, Taiwan and South Korea will “ripple throughout our economy.”
The tariffs on imports from Vietnam and Indonesia — 46% and 32%, respectively — will hurt coffee roasters and cafes, said Blas Alfaro, senior vice president at Fulcrum Coffee Roasters in Seattle.
“Those tariffs don’t just affect imports, they affect real people, local businesses and the community economy,” Alfaro said.
And while the goal of the tariffs is boosting domestic manufacturing, the tariffs will drive up the cost of materials used in manufacturing, Otto Punke noted.
The tariffs “disrupt industries like Boeing, our shipping terminals, our farmers, our tech companies,” Nguyen said. “All of this is on the line.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/container-ship-port-of-seattle-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-08 22:11:40.016519

(Provided photo.)The Department of Justice has been ordered to reinstate a Montana Highway Patrol trooper it fired last April after the officer shared a workplace climate survey with union staff.
The survey results showed low morale and other problems.
Former Trooper Alicia Bragg, union president at the time, provided a copy of the survey results to her field consultant and was subsequently fired last April.
“The evidence showed clearly that (Bragg) was getting multiple communications from MHP officers about the survey, its security and anonymity, as well as possible retaliation,” the decision said. “This is precisely the sort of communications that falls squarely within the union’s purview whether there are active negotiations ongoing or not.”
In the April 4, 2025 decision following arbitration hearings in December, the arbitrator found Bragg was wrongfully terminated and ordered the DOJ to reinstate her with full back pay and accrued benefits.
Arbitrator Jeffrey Jacobs said the union was correct in stating Bragg had rightfully acted within her role as local union president by communicating about a public survey with union staff.
“The inescapable conclusion is that (Bragg) was acting in her capacity as the union president when she sent the document to the union,” Jacobs said. “ … While the survey may have been somewhat embarrassing to the MHP, that alone did not render her action terminable.”
The decision said she is to be reinstated within 10 days, and it said there is no basis for any discipline “at all.”
“The state made much of (Bragg’s) comments that she would do this again and claimed that she showed no remorse,” the decision said. “Remorse is not the issue here. She acted within her scope as the union president.”
Tuesday, Bragg said she cried tears of joy and relief when she received a call the same morning with news the union had won her case.
She said the result made her feel supported, and it comes just days before the anniversary of the day she was fired, April 19.
Bragg is currently employed by the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff’s Office.
“I’ve waited nearly a year for this response,” Bragg said.
Bragg had earlier said some troopers told her they feared retaliation for their responses to the workplace climate survey, and the results reflected a lack of support for employees.
In firing Bragg, the Montana Highway Patrol argued members of a small committee that had received the survey had been ordered not to distribute it, and she disobeyed an order.
The arbitrator, though, found she acted correctly in the scope of her role with the union.
“It was clear though from her record that this directive was very different from one that she might receive in her role as a trooper,” the decision said. “There is no evidence that (Bragg) would disobey an order regarding her operational functions in the field.”
In April 2024, the Montana Federation of Public Employees filed an unfair labor practice complaint, alleging wrongful termination and retaliation by the Department of Justice and its Montana Highway Patrol division on behalf of Bragg.
In May, the Montana Federation of Public Employees filed a grievance against the Department of Justice. The grievance landed in arbitration after the DOJ denied it had merit.
In a statement, Bragg said she was terminated for doing her job “as a trooper who loves serving my state and as a union president who’s fiercely loyal to my fellow law enforcement officers.”
“Senior leaders at MHP and DOJ tried to sanitize and slow roll a public workplace climate survey that reflected poorly on their leadership, and I stood up for troopers,” Bragg said in a statement.
Bragg, who had worked at the highway patrol for a decade, said she couldn’t comment on whether she would be interested in reinstatement.
However, she said she is working with the union on figuring out restoration of back pay.
A spokesperson for the DOJ did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday afternoon.
The MFPE said the arbitrator’s decision reflects the Montana Constitution’s protections for the public’s right to know.
“DOJ cannot withhold or obfuscate information about the public safety services Montanans fund and rely on every day,” MFPE said.
It also said the decision upholds legal protections surrounding activities that Montana union members have fought for and continue to defend.
“I am pleased but not surprised to find the law is in fact on our side,” said MFPE President Amanda Curtis in a statement. “No employer can target or punish a union member for doing union work, and union work includes uplifting and improving our professions. Trooper Bragg’s fellow union members are proud of her leadership and service.”
The climate results included biting criticisms of the Montana Attorney General’s Office.
Participants in the survey alleged Attorney General Austin Knudsen was micromanaging the MHP, failing to communicate, and its human resources department had an outsized and negative influence on the division.
Former employees earlier told the Daily Montanan the AG’s Office tried to keep the survey results under wraps, and Knudsen became upset when he learned a media outlet had filed a records request for it.
The Daily Montanan published a story about the results in March 2024.
However, the decision from the arbitrator said it was clear that Bragg did not send the document to the press, “nor did she direct anyone at the union to do so.”
Tuesday, Bragg said she believes the climate has gotten worse at the highway patrol since the climate survey, and she knows of several officers who have left since.
“Some of my oldest friends with the highway patrol have left and taken jobs either outside of law enforcement, or in law enforcement in a different jurisdiction now, just because the working conditions haven’t improved. The morale hasn’t improved,” she said.
“They still are waiting for management to show them a reason to stay.”
The Department of Justice did not respond to a question sent late Tuesday afternoon about whether the climate had improved since the survey last year.
Bragg, though, said she feels like her termination damaged the relationship between the federation and the highway patrol, and she doesn’t believe troopers are coming forward with concerns having seen the agency fire a union president.
She said the decision the Montana Highway Patrol made to fire her forced her to change her lifestyle, and it brought her character into question.
“There hasn’t been a day that has passed this past year that I haven’t thought about the decision that they made that changed the trajectory of my life and the trajectory of my career,” Bragg said.
She said the outcome backs her decision to stand up for troopers, and she said she hopes the agency can learn to work well with troopers and union members.
“It’s important for DOJ and MHP leadership to recognize and value their team by addressing the hard truths and choices openly,” Bragg said.
Collaborating with union members can lead to meaningful improvements in both working conditions and public safety, she said.
“Embracing challenges with transparency can foster a more positive and productive environment for everyone involved and will greatly improve morale and retention,” Bragg said.
In June 2024, an investigator found “probable merit” exists to support the allegation the DOJ committed an unfair labor practice, but the complaint had been on hold at the Department of Labor and Industry pending the outcome of the grievance.
An MFPE spokesperson said the union asked Tuesday to resume that process.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/BRAGG.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 20:59:30.019493

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Another criminal prosecution against a former South Dakota state employee moved toward resolution Tuesday when a Springfield woman pleaded guilty to forging and falsifying food-service inspection reports.
Renee Lynn Strong, 55, entered the plea in Hughes County Circuit Court. She will be sentenced June 10 for two felony counts of forgery and two felony counts of offering false or forged instruments for filing or recording in a public office.
Each forgery count carries a maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Each count of the other charge carries a maximum sentence of two years in prison and a $4,000 fine.
‘Don’t do that’: Attorney general says guilty verdict in state theft trial sends a message

Strong was an employee of the South Dakota Department of Public Safety and was performing contract work for the Department of Health when the crimes occurred.
South Dakota’s Division of Criminal Investigation investigated the case, and Attorney General Marty Jackley’s office is prosecuting it.
Strong’s plea came five days after a Hughes County jury convicted former state employee Lonna Carroll of two felony counts of grand theft for stealing $1.8 million over the course of 13 years from the Division of Child Protection Services. She is awaiting sentencing.
The Carroll and Strong cases are among five criminal prosecutions that Jackley has filed against former state employees since last year for allegations related to their work with state government.
The run of allegations started in August, when Jackley said a deceased former three-decade employee of the state Department of Revenue, Sandra O’Day, had allegedly created 13 fake vehicle titles to help her secure $400,000 in loans. No charges were filed, because O’Day died before her alleged behavior came to light.
In October, Jackley announced charges against two other former Department of Revenue employees, Lynne Hunsley, 64, and Danielle Degenstein, 51, both of Pierre.
Hunsley has since pleaded guilty to forgery and grand theft by deception for creating a fake vehicle title that she used as proof of a trade-in to help her avoid excise taxes. She was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $1,000 fine and $1,200 in restitution to the state.
Degenstein is charged with a misdemeanor for allegedly concealing her knowledge of a crime committed by a person identified in court documents as “S.O.” — initials that match O’Day’s. Degenstein’s case file indicates she has reached a plea agreement and her June trial has been canceled.

In January, Amalia Escalante Barrientos, 28, of Brookings, pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for using a grocery voucher intended for clients of the Department of Social Services. She was sentenced to pay a $400 fine, $96.50 in court costs and $449.98 in restitution. She’ll avoid serving 180 days in jail if she complies with the sentence.
In response to the run of prosecutions, Jackley supported a package of four bills passed during the recent legislative session that will expand the investigatory authority of the state auditor, strengthen the Board of Internal Controls, institute mandatory reporting requirements for state employees and penalties for failing to report, and establish protections for whistleblowers.
Lawmakers passed legislation strengthening the ability of the Legislature’s Government Operations and Audit Committee to conduct investigations and issue orders known as subpoenas requiring people to testify or supply information.

It passed the House in March and awaits approval from the Senate.

Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, attempted to pass similar legislation last year, but it did not get a vote in the House. Alabama is one of 20 states that tax period products, according to the Alliance for Period Supplies. 
“People shouldn’t have to choose between groceries and period products or groceries and baby formula,” Rinderkincht said.
URGE also advocated against SB 277, sponsored by Sen. Shay Shelnutt, R-Trussville, that centers sex education in Alabama on abstinence until marriage. According to a University of Washington study, abstinence-only-until-marriage programs do not improve teen pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases or infections. 
“If that’s something that you want to do, that is totally fine. However, you should be giving people enough information to make informed choices,” said Sylvia Glenn, a 21-year-old student at UA, in an interview.
The pair and other student advocates with URGE met with lawmakers to express their support for the tax exemption on menstrual products. Although Rinderkincht and Glenn are not originally from Alabama, they said the policies will still affect them while they are in the state for school.
“This is me trying to give myself a little education about what it does look like to show up and to represent my district. I mean, our representatives are representing us, but also the other way around, how I can do my piece and advocate for myself in my community,” Glenn said.

Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, speaks on the West Virginia House floor on April 3, 2025. On Tuesday, April 8, 2025, Flanigan spoke out in the House Judiciary Committee against a bill to ban diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state. (Perry Bennett | West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia House Judiciary Committee on Tuesday advanced a bill to prohibit nearly all diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives in the state, bringing a policy priority for Gov. Patrick Morrisey closer to the finish line before the session is set to end on Saturday night.
Senate Bill 474 — which passed the state Senate on March 26 and was advanced by the House Committee on Education last week — bans the offering of specific services or opportunities to people based on their race, color, ethnicity, country of origin and, in some instances, sex.
The bill, as currently written, only applies to DEI policies and initiatives in state and local governments and schools, including institutions of higher education. In response to Morrisey’s executive order, colleges and universities in West Virginia have already begun to review and dismantle services previously offered to students of different races, genders, sexual identities and more.
In Tuesday’s House Judiciary meeting, lawmakers voted down an amendment from the House Education committee that added “sex” in multiple places throughout the proposed code where the other identifiers (race, ethnicity, etc.) were already listed. Without that amendment, the bill does allow for certain services and “special benefits” to be offered to people based on their sex.
The bill also explicitly allows colleges applying for grants to issue statements in those applications that “highlight the institution’s work in supporting” first-generation college students, low-income students and “underserved” student populations. None of those terms are defined in the proposed code section. 
Diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives are often offered to ensure all people — no matter their background or systemic factors that are known to exist and are proven to oppress them — are granted the same opportunities as other, often more privileged people.
The bill to prohibit DEI is a policy priority for Morrisey and is the legislative side of an executive order he issued earlier this year meant to do the same. It’s reflective of a trend spearheaded by Republicans nationwide meant to undermine and end DEI in all its forms. 
During discussion in committee on Tuesday, Del. Bill Flanigan, R-Ohio, joined Democratic Dels. Shawn Fluharty, D-Ohio, and Evan Hansen, D-Monongalia, in speaking against the passage of the bill. 
Flanigan said he thought SB 474 was “horrible” and worried that its mandate for teachers and professors to instruct contentious issues — like systemic racism, sexism and more — in a “neutral” and “colorblind” manner would do more harm than good.
People, often unconsciously, are operating under implicit biases that can hurt others who are afforded less privilege than them, Flanigan said. That behavior, he continued, leads to real harm and holds down  individuals by not allowing them to benefit from the same systems and opportunities others can.
“What we do to people without realizing it hurts and can harm. To say that we are ‘colorblind’ I think is incorrect; It’s not a proper way to be. You have to look at people’s color — it’s there. I think what we’re trying to do as a state is to say that we don’t need to accept these types of things, but it does happen. It’s there,” Flanigan said. “We can’t just randomly say we’re going to eliminate diversity, equity and inclusion because somebody somewhere said, ‘Oh shoot, man, white people are losing right now.’  
“I know some of you are having a hard time even looking me in the eyes right now,” Flanigan continued. “… I don’t like this type of idea. It’s not bringing us forward in the country. I really think it’s holding us up.”
None of the individuals who voted in support for SB 474 in the committee spoke in favor of the bill before it passed via voice vote on Tuesday.
SB 474, if made law, will ban any state agency from running an office or division to promote diversity, equity or inclusion practices or from directing an employee to do the same. All current offices that do so are to be shut down.
It would also prohibit expressing any preferences for employment based on any metrics of diversity, equity or inclusion. No person hired can be required under the law to participate in diversity, equity and inclusion training and state agencies generally will not be allowed to run such training.
The bill would restrict how certain race- and gender-related topics are approached by teachers in schools, who will not be able to teach any lessons suggesting that someone’s race, ethnicity or sex makes them morally “superior” to someone else, among other things. The bill will also prevent teachers and school staff from being required to use a student’s preferred pronouns if those pronouns do not match the child’s sex.
The bill now advances to the full House for consideration and passage.

(Photo courtesy of Bathsheba Demuth)Later this spring, barges of heavy equipment will pull away from a launch on Alaska’s road system and begin a journey up the Yukon River.
More than 100 miles upstream, a tributary, Birch Creek, branches off.
The equipment’s destination is along that creek, on remote property owned by Alaska Native corporations in a huge basin called the Yukon Flats.
There, an oil company will set up a specially designed rig to drill the basin’s first-ever deep wells, which the landowners hope could lead to the discovery of the state’s next big oil field. 
If found, petroleum could create well-paying jobs for Yukon watershed residents and generate big dividend payments for the 20,500 shareholders of Doyon, the for-profit Native corporation for Alaska’s Interior region.
Doyon’s leaders describe the drilling effort as a rare opportunity — one that could deliver a lucrative resource sought from its lands for decades, though never produced.
But the campaign has engendered a broad backlash from tribal governments in the region.
Much of the opposition stems from the track record of the business that will be doing the drilling: Hilcorp, the large, privately held oil company founded by a Texas billionaire, Jeff Hildebrand.
Hilcorp has substantially increased its holdings in Alaska in recent years and now operates the massive Prudhoe Bay field on the state’s North Slope, where it partners with major firms like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.

	But it also has a history of leaks and accidents, prompting fears from Yukon watershed residents about the risks of its new drilling program.
“We’ve seen it so many times, that these big corporations come in and they take and take. They say they’re going to reinvest and it never happens,” said Rhonda Pitka, chief of the tribal government in Beaver, a Yukon River village some 20 miles downstream of the Birch Creek confluence. “What will we end up with at the end of all this?”
Whether the Yukon Flats will support commercial fossil fuel production remains highly uncertain, and likely won’t be known for years. More exploratory drilling will almost certainly be needed to better define a deposit even if Hilcorp finds evidence of petroleum this summer, and the infrastructure to extract and move it to market would require an array of environmental permits.
Even at this early stage, opponents are aggressively fighting the drilling plans. At a meeting last month, Interior Alaska’s consortium of 42 tribal governments, Tanana Chiefs Conference, approved a resolution against oil development by Hilcorp in the Yukon Flats, saying it’s too risky for the “ecologically and culturally significant region.”
But leaders of Birch Creek, the tiny Indigenous community closest to the drilling sites, have endorsed the effort, saying it could produce desperately needed jobs.
Birch Creek’s Native village corporation also owns some of the land where the drilling will take place, and like Doyon, it stands to benefit from a discovery.
“Without the economic activity this exploration project could create, Birch Creek and the other Yukon Flats villages may simply cease to exist, and our way of life will be lost forever,” the community’s tribal government said in a 2020 resolution endorsing the program. Birch Creek’s population is now just 30 people, and its school closed more than two decades ago because it had too few students, according to the state of Alaska.
The support from Birch Creek has given Doyon and Hilcorp the “social license to operate in that area,” Doyon’s chief executive, Aaron Schutt, said in an interview.
If oil is found, Doyon’s agreements with Hilcorp would require the company to hire shareholders and local residents, he added.

	Schutt said that Doyon’s early leaders, a half-century ago, chose to claim land in the Yukon Flats specifically because of its potential to yield oil and gas. 
“We can’t re-select. We can’t undo those deals that were done by our leaders 50 years ago,” he said. “We’re stuck with the hand we were dealt from 1972 to 1975. And we have to balance all of these various constituencies and opportunities and concerns, and do the best job that we can.”
Birch Creek leaders, through a Doyon official, declined to comment. Hilcorp released its own prepared statement saying it’s “excited to work with Doyon and community stakeholders to advance this meaningful exploration project in the Yukon Flats.” 
“Together, we are developing a tailored program to responsibly evaluate the region’s energy and resource potential,” said spokesman Matt Shuckerow.
A geologic enigma
The Yukon Flats basin covers more than 10,000 square miles, bounded by the Brooks Range mountains to the north and the White Mountains to the south. The Yukon River sweeps across from east to west, and the trans-Alaska pipeline snakes over the land from north to south.
The basin began forming at least 60 million years ago, according to Marwan Wartes, a veteran geologist with the Alaska Department of Natural Resources. 
It’s still sinking today, making it difficult to study. Often, petroleum-rich regions of the state have experienced uplift, producing rocky outcroppings that give glimpses of their geologic histories — but those clues aren’t present in the flats, Wartes said. 
 

  A United States Geological Survey map of the Yukon Flats
 

	Experts suspect that the area contains sedimentary deposits that could produce natural gas, or even oil. But no one has drilled deep wells to confirm those theories, so the flats’ subsurface remains something of a geologic enigma.
“When I look at the whole map of Alaska, it always catches my eye, and I always am frustrated that we know so little about it — because it’s mostly burying itself,” Wartes said. “It is a mystery, and I think most geologists would agree to that.”
Today, the region, home to the Yukon Flats National Wildlife Refuge, is important habitat for as many as 2 million migratory ducks, as well as several species of fish. Its salmon and moose have long sustained the region’s Native people, who now live primarily in seven Indigenous villages within or near the refuge.
For nearly two centuries, the Yukon Flats have also been the source of global commodities — starting in the mid-1800s with furs, and continuing with the 1893 discovery of gold in Birch Creek.
The region has never produced oil; nearly all of Alaska’s petroleum comes from the other side of the Brooks Range, on the North Slope. 
But Doyon and oil companies have long eyed the flats for its potential, dating back to the years after the 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act. That federal legislation terminated Indigenous land claims in the state by transferring some 10% of Alaska’s land to newly formed, Native-owned corporations — which, with certain limitations, could choose the land that they wanted.
Doyon, owned by Alaska Natives with ties to the Interior region, became the state’s largest private landowner.
Working at the time with smaller Indigenous-owned corporations connected to the region’s villages, Schutt said, Doyon selected additional land in the Yukon Flats, hoping that it would yield petroleum. The idea was to capture areas with oil potential while also leaving room for the region’s residents to continue their subsistence-based lifestyles.

	Doyon formalized that strategy, Schutt said, in agreements with five village corporations. A 1974 agreement with Beaver’s Indigenous-owned corporation refers to the “potential for oil and gas” in the area around the village, “the development of which would benefit all of the shareholders of Doyon.”
Pitka, Beaver’s current tribal chief, said that oil was not the driving force behind the village’s participation in the Doyon agreement. 
“The village corporations picked land for subsistence,” Pitka said. “People were living on the land.”
 

  Rhonda Pitka
 

	In the years after the land deals, major oil companies prospected for oil in the Yukon Flats; Exxon even signed an exploration agreement with Doyon. But Exxon pulled out of the region after its major 1989 oil spill near Valdez.
Studies continued, however.
Doyon contractors have collected hundreds of sediment and soil samples throughout the basin. The corporation has also conducted seismic testing, and it collaborated with federal and state agencies that drilled a research well to a moderate depth in 2004. The United States Geological Survey has estimated that the Yukon Flats contain 173 million barrels of oil, with a smaller chance of as much as 600 million barrels.
“This has been a basin that’s been on everyone’s radar as having potential for a long, long time,” said Wartes.
Hilcorp’s involvement began in 2019, when it signed an exploration agreement with Doyon covering some 2,500 square miles of the Native corporation’s land. 
Since then, Hilcorp has flown airborne surveys to gather geologic data, and it’s also drilled more than a dozen shallow test wells. Last year, it narrowed its focus, signing oil and gas leases with Doyon that cover 94 square miles near Birch Creek.
 

  Hilcorp shared this photo of one of its shallow test wells drilled in the Yukon Flats in 2021 in correspondence with state regulators.
 

	This kind of remote oil and gas exploration work, known as wildcatting, is not Hilcorp’s specialty; the company is better known for buying aging oil fields and making them more productive.
“They must see something that really captivates them, because there’s no shortage of oil on the North Slope,” said Phil Wight, an energy and environmental historian at the University of Alaska Fairbanks.
Even Schutt, the Doyon chief executive, said he’s not sure exactly what’s driving Hilcorp’s interest.
“I actually don’t know the answer to that,” he said. “It’s still kind of a mystery.”
A big upside for Doyon
This summer, Hilcorp plans to drill two exploration wells on separate sites.
The company has not publicly announced its plans, but some details have trickled into public view through documents submitted to the state. Hilcorp’s drilling effort requires an array of permits, among them a contingency plan that includes how the company would respond to a blowout.
The locations of the company’s two planned wells are 10 and 15 miles, respectively, from the Yukon River and the village of Birch Creek, according to the permitting documents. The sites will be supported by a worker camp staffed 24 hours a day.
The area is along a lower branch of Birch Creek and is accessible only by barge, helicopter or skiff, depending on water levels. Schutt said the work will leave a light footprint.
“If there’s no further development, those lands will be indistinguishable from the lands next door in 10 years,” he said.

	Opponents of the plan have focused their efforts on a pending Hilcorp request to state land managers to pump water from Birch Creek and a nearby lake for its drilling operation. 
The company says it will take a maximum of half of one cubic foot per second from the creek, which it describes as 0.05% of its flow. Ten different tribal groups have objected, according to their comment letters released by regulators in response to a Northern Journal public records request.
Allowing Hilcorp’s proposed withdrawal “would degrade water quality and jeopardize the ecological integrity of Birch Creek,” said one comment letter, from the Yukon River Inter-Tribal Watershed Council. 
“We, the Indigenous Tribes and First Nations from the headwaters to the mouth of the Yukon River, urge the department to join us and put all of our future generations first,” the letter said.
If Hilcorp finds oil, the discovery would likely be just the start of more intense environmental battles to come.
Given the large cost of building a new oil field, construction would only make financial sense if it contained at least 200 million barrels of oil, according to Doyon’s estimates. Tying a development into the trans-Alaska pipeline would entail crossing federal land and require environmental permits that would face stiff opposition.
But for Doyon, the effort is worthwhile because of its big upside, according to Schutt. The company is already invested in the oil and gas industry; it owns a drilling subsidiary that maintains some of the largest rigs on the North Slope.
A new field in the Yukon Flats could produce a “massive royalty check” each year, much of which would be shared with Alaska’s other Native corporations under federal law, according Schutt. Doyon’s subsidiaries would be in line for contracts to work on the development, he added, and Yukon Flats villages likely could save money by tapping into newly available natural gas for heating. 
“It would economically support the whole subregion and Doyon for generations,” he said. “Those are the types of opportunities that don’t come along very often for us.”

Bob Ferguson has let House and Senate lawmakers know some of the concerns he has with the spending plans they’ve crafted.
A nine-page letter penned by his budget director reiterates Ferguson’s clarion call for maintaining strong reserves, restraining new spending and squeezing savings from state-funded programs before considering new revenue.
Budget writers said this week that the level of granular detail in the letter didn’t surprise them. But the absence of advice from the governor on where they could make a bigger dent in addressing a multibillion-dollar shortfall did.
“I would like direction from the governor and [Office of Financial Management] on where we can find additional reductions,” said Senate Ways and Means Committee Chair June Robinson, D-Everett, the architect of the Senate’s spending plan. “We’re in conversation about that.”
Ferguson’s April 4 missive identifies more than two dozen policies and programs of concern scattered through the 1,300-page spending blueprints of each chamber.

There are too few dollars to fight invasive pests like Japanese beetles and European green crabs. There are too many proposed closures of reentry centers for people exiting prison. Cuts in behavioral health and social service programs are too deep and funding must be locked in for the Washington State Patrol to replace its bomb squad equipment ahead of the 2026 World Cup.
No mention of the governor’s demand for $100 million for law enforcement hiring grants. No comments on the level of education funding, which Ferguson has said he wants to be a greater percentage of the general fund.
Such large policy items are already part of the budget discussions, Brionna Aho, communications director for Ferguson, wrote in an email.
“The intent of the concerns letter is to elevate things that haven’t been covered in those discussions, as well as offer technical feedback, raise implementation concerns and any policy concerns,” she wrote.
But for Robinson, a lawmaker at the center of trying to balance the state’s nearly $80 billion two-year budget, following the feedback in Ferguson’s letter would pose new complications.
“I’ll have to spend money,” she said.
Rep. Travis Couture, R-Allyn, the lead budget writer for House Republicans, said the letter was a chance to flag the importance of some of the big items, and instead, the governor sent a mixed message.
“If budget writers essentially filled the litany of things he asked for, there would be a lot more spending,” he said. “To me, you can’t have your cake and eat it too.”
Couture said not every item highlighted in the letter is a bad idea. For example, he appreciated the governor’s asking for lawmakers to increase funding to fight invasive European green crabs that threaten commercial shellfish operations in his district.
But he disagrees with Ferguson’s desire to continue funding the Columbia River Gorge Commission. The House budget defunds the commission that was established in 1987 by the states of Oregon and Washington through the Columbia River Gorge Compact. Its role is overseeing policies and programs to protect the Columbia River Gorge National Scenic Area.
This won’t be the last exchange between Ferguson and budget writers.
K.D. Chapman-See, Ferguson’s budget director, plans to submit  “a variety of specific policy and technical issues” to budget writers in the near future. 
Sen. Chris Gildon, R-Puyallup, who is the Republican leader on the Senate budget committee, said he wants to see if that document discusses the treatment of Ferguson priorities like school funding and the police hiring grants.
“I continue to appreciate and agree with his concerns regarding the importance of maintaining strong reserves,” Gildon said. “I also agree with the admonition that new spending be restrained.”
But the senator said he disagreed with the conclusion in the letter that meaningful reductions alone will not fully address the budget shortfall.
“It is clear that new taxes are not inevitable,” Gildon said.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0785-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 20:05:20.552809

(Photo by Kevork Djansezian | Getty Images)Lawmakers in each chamber of the Montana Legislature have advanced bills that shift marijuana tax revenue, but preserve conservation funding.
A previous bill that would have stopped the flow of marijuana revenue to a group of Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks programs, drawing opposition from many conservation groups, was tabled in a Senate committee on April 1. 
The two new bills each passed their respective house of origin with significantly more bipartisan support — Senate Bill 537 passed on Saturday 45-0, while House Bill 932 passed the same day 71-27. 
SB 537, introduced by Sen. Daniel Zolnikov, R-Billings, keeps the existing amount of funding for conservation initiatives in place but expands how the funds can be used. The bill also increases distributions to the Healing and Ending Addiction through Recovery and Treatment (HEART) account, and adds funding for the Department of Justice, including substantial investments in law enforcement. 
“I would call this the Cops and Conservation Act,” Zolnikov said on the Senate floor on April 4. “Because one thing we hear about from my side of the aisle is we need more law enforcement, there’s more problems coming on, how do we help those guys. And I’ll tell you what was awesome about this bill, working with the other side of the aisle, they were very supportive of this side of the aisle’s priorities. Working with this side of the aisle, they seemed to be very comfortable clarifying the buckets on this side of the aisle’s priorities and helping on the conservation side. And in the end, we’re trying to fill gaps.”
Zolnikov’s bill emerged as a compromise piece of legislation following the pushback to Senate Bill 307, brought by Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvray, R-Billings, which would have shifted marijuana revenue from conservation to law enforcement. 
McGillvray said his bill gave lawmakers a choice, whether they thought people, who may be harmed by the effects of marijuana, or trails and wildlife were more important issues to fund. 
By contrast, Zolnikov sought to eliminate the choice and instead give all stakeholders a little bit of what they wanted by allocating the roughly $33 million of tax revenue that currently goes into the state’s general fund. 
Under the new structure, the current 4% revenue allocated each for state parks, trails and recreation and nongame wildlife remains as is. The 20% of funds currently earmarked for FWP’s Habitat Montana fund instead goes to a new Habitat Legacy Account, which Zolnikov said broadens the use of the funds. 
According to the bill, 75% of funds in the account must be used solely to fund wildlife habitat projects, while the rest may be used for various conservation-related projects including noxious weed programs, grants for conservation districts, big game and wildlife highway crossings, and land and water acquisitions or easement purchases. 
“It’s all types of buckets in there that the conservation folks worked on and supported,” Zolnikov said. “If you were in the hearing, it was the most fun group of people you could ever see all supporting it.”

The HEART fund, which currently receives a set $6 million of marijuana revenue, would be boosted to a 20% allocation, which will allow the account to grow with tax revenue. 
The other additions, which target needs identified by McGillvray such as boosting law enforcement include: 2.5% for DOJ canine training, 1.5% for DOJ sexual assault exams and kits, 0.25% for the Board of Crime Control to fund crisis intervention training; 14% to the behavioral health system for future generations funds; 6.5% for drug and alcohol use prevention and 31% for DOJ  law enforcement grants. 
Those grants would include distributing $50,000 to each police department, sheriff’s office and tribal police department, plus proportional distributions based on department size. 
“It’s a pretty thorough bill. I’d say, working on it, I had to learn about a lot of problems that I think there’s some gaps that we’re not filling, and this really helped fills them in the future,” Zolnikov said. 
McGillvray told reporters on Tuesday that he felt many of the things in Zolnikov’s bill, such as letting the HEART fund grow with tax revenue, were smart, but he still had some concerns about using the funds for conservation. 
“The nexus between marijuana revenue and marijuana harms is just smart tax policy. And unfortunately, it all got started on the wrong foot, and it was a tough sell to get it back on the right foot,” he said. 
McGillvray added that removing revenue from the state’s general fund for law enforcement is a “big bite that could have a struggle” with the governor’s office. 

On the House side, Rep. Ken Walsh, R-Twin Bridges, brought HB 932, which targets just the current 30% of conservation funding allocated to Habitat Montana.
It functions in roughly the same way as SB 537, moving those funds to a new Habitat Legacy Account. 
Under HB 932, that account would funnel 75% into a separate Land and Wildlife Stewardship account that would be used solely for habitat conservation projects, while the remaining funds would be split between wildlife crossings, and the Wildlife Habitat Improvement Program (WHIP) account. 
WHIP funds can currently only be used for noxious weed treatment, but Walsh’s bill would greatly expand their use. 
“What this bill will do is expand that bucket for private land owners, and conservation groups and fish, wildlife and parks to work together,” Walsh said
He listed off some possible applications — irrigation infrastructure, forest management, prescribed fire, fish passage, soil enhancement, and wetland protection. 
“Maybe even wildlife crossings, so we don’t hit as many elk and deer on the road,” he said. 
The bill drew some opposition for continuing to fund conservation-related programs. 
“This bill is going to lock up marijuana revenue in wildlife management kinds of things. And I know that’s important to this body. But we have been listening all session about what’s going on in our correctional system — we don’t have enough space, don’t have enough space,” Rep. Fiona Nave, R-Columbus, said. “That’s drug driven. We need the marijuana funding … to be available for drug treatment and law enforcement.”
But lawmakers overwhelmingly backed the bill under its expanded scope. 
“This allocated available dollars to important Montana industries, agriculture and the outdoor economy. It’s a good bill for these businesses,” said Rep. Ed Buttrey, R-Great Falls.
HB 932 is awaiting a hearing before the Senate Fish and Game Committee while SB 537 will be heard in the House Taxation Committee later this month.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/weed.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 20:05:20.552809

(Paul Hammel/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A plane ticket for a “romantic” partner and other “suspected improprieties” have turned the State Auditor’s spotlight on a small, publicly-funded nonprofit whose board is appointed by the governor and whose mission is to support Nebraskans with disabilities.
A new auditor probe of the Nebraska Statewide Independent Living Council points to alleged “malfeasance” by the former executive director, Don Dew — though Dew and the council’s former treasurer insist that the spending was board-approved.

Both have resigned, and assert that certain board members stirred trouble for Dew in part because he is gay.
The new board chairwoman dismissed that as nonsense and said State Auditor Mike Foley was summoned after Dew did not produce requested records to support spending. 
Both sides agree on at least one thing. They said the gubernatorial-led process by which the board’s appointments are made has been slow-going — and they believe an undersized governing board with too many unfilled slots contributed to problems.
Report goes to FBI, law enforcement
The board is authorized for 15 voting members and five non-voting members, which represent various state agencies and service providers, according to the auditor’s report. For several years, current and past members said, the organization has operated with two or three voting members and several non-voting members.
Currently, the council has two regularly voting board members “with a third that is used under certain circumstances,” and 10 nonvoting members mostly representing independent living organizations, said Jody Faltys, who returned to the board in late in 2024 and is now chair.
Phil Olsen, state accounting administrator under Gov. Jim Pillen, said the minimum requirement under law is three voting board members but that he foresees others being appointed soon. He said the council has seen turnover with members uneasy under Dew’s financial leadership.
 

What is NESILC?
Based in Lancaster County, the Nebraska Statewide Independent Living Council (NESILC) is funded primarily with federal dollars from the Independent Living Administration.
Established in 2001, the public benefit nonprofit corporation has a mission to, in partnership with the Independent Living Network, promote independence, inclusion, non-discrimination and dignity for all people with disabilities in Nebraska.
States are required to establish and maintain such independent and statewide councils, according to the auditor’s report, to be eligible for financial assistance authorized under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 that was further amended under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act of 2014.
State leaders said a federal grant of about $340,000 is divided between the council and two Centers for Independent Living, which are the League of Human Dignity and Independence Rising.



Faltys said interest in joining the council board had waned, and she hopes that will improve.
“It’s all about checks and balances, and what we need is to get those guard rails as strong as they can be to make us as strong as we can be,” Faltys said. 
The Statewide Independent Living Council, with an annual budget of about $115,000, is a small but vital organization whose existence is required by law to unlock federal funds that help Nebraskans with disabilities live independently. 
It came under auditor scrutiny after board members reported possible financial improprieties. Findings are laid out in a 25-page report, which included recommendations to improve internal controls. The report was made public last week and addressed to Faltys. 
Any further investigation lies with the FBI, Lancaster County Attorney and Nebraska Attorney General, which got copies of the report from Foley’s office.
Plane ticket questioned
Foley, in a statement, focused on $9,466 in what his team called “suspected improprieties” by Dew over a three-year period: $2,043 in alleged excess pay to himself; $6,750 in health insurance reimbursements that lacked documentation, and a $672 plane ticket for his partner to a work-related conference.











While better late than never, some of this could have been avoided had the NESILC board taken its oversight responsibilities more seriously from the start.


– State Auditor Mike Foley



“At the risk of sounding like a broken record, I can’t emphasize this enough: Allowing someone to exercise anything close to exclusive control over an organization’s finances with no meaningful oversight is begging for serious trouble,” Foley wrote. 
He said the audit team noted the council’s lack of policies and procedures for safeguarding funds and said leaders appear to be taking corrective measures. 
Olsen said he, representing the Nebraska Department of Administrative Services, took over in 2024 as the designated state conduit responsible for receiving and disbursing funds to the council from the federal government. He said he raised a red flag after he started attending the council’s quarterly meetings and noticed a lack of bank statements, credit card and expense approvals.
Faltys saw the audit as confirming  “what we saw.”
Said Foley: “While better late than never, some of this could have been avoided had the NESILC board taken its oversight responsibilities more seriously from the start.”
COVID-19 was turning point
In a response included in the auditor’s report, the council recapped what led to this point. Its current leader said a COVID-19-related shutdown led to heavy change in the organization — as its only executive director up to that point retired.

Dew, a former board chair, then was hired and held the position three years until his resignation effective at the close of 2024. The audit said his salary was $26,168.
The council wrote that Dew “didn’t live up to the high standards” set by his predecessor.
“With board members leaving, with policies and procedures not being applied rigorously, it soon became clear that the future of NESILC was a turning point,” stated the council. 
The council wrote that it was disappointed in its own lack of oversight and was “wiping the slate clean and refocusing on our mission.”
Clearing name 
Dew, with a completely different take, was angry at the allegations. He said the auditor’s team didn’t ask him for his version of what happened. 
He said he had filed his own complaint with the Nebraska Attorney General after a board member removed what he said were confidential files from a storage area. 
Dew said he is working with an attorney and considering legal action as he feels his name should be cleared.
“Everything had been approved,” he told the Nebraska Examiner, calling the probe incomplete. “It’s in a budget or through an executive committee meeting, so there’s no way that they can say I did (anything) without approval.”
Deanna Henke, treasurer of the council’s board during much of the alleged misuse of funds, backed Dew.
She said the board approved the airline ticket in the spring of 2024 for Dew’s partner who, she and Dew said, served as a personal attendant. Dew said he has epilepsy, controlled by medication, and other disabilities. At the time of the conference, Dew said he was suffering from several broken ribs.











It was not a sightseeing trip. He wasn’t gallivanting around town in Little Rock, Arkansas.


– Deanna Henke, former treasurer of the NESILC



Henke said Dew was mandated to attend the work conference, which she said he helped lead. “If they require a personal attendant due to their disability, then we pay … not only for Don to go, but for his assistant.” 
She said “it’s been that way for years,” and added “it was not a sightseeing trip. He wasn’t gallivanting around town in Little Rock, Arkansas.”
‘Target on his back’
According to Foley’s press release, council representatives informed the audit team that the ticket was for a man with whom Dew had romantic and business relationships. The representatives said the man is “neither an employee nor in any way affiliated with the organization.”
Said Henke: “Don being a gay man, they’ve had a target on his back ever since he became executive director.”
Faltys said she saw no pre-approval records and called the ticket the “final straw that broke the camel’s back.” She added, “There were no receipts. There were no minutes for meetings.”

Noted in the audit were 98 “questionable” credit card transactions, besides the airline ticket, that totaled about $8,400, including for a Dropbox account, business vendors and Jimmy John’s restaurant. The report said Dew controlled the card.
“Board members were not aware of, nor did they approve, most of these payments,” the auditing team said.
In addition, the auditing team said it could not locate adequate documentation to substantiate board approval of 17 payments totaling $47,580 over three years for apparent reimbursements or other payments unrelated to wages, including health insurance stipends, retirement contributions and bonuses.
‘Look at facts’ 
Deputy State Auditor Craig Kubicek said in an interview that the team didn’t speak directly to Dew, but its findings were based on records available at the time.
“We look at facts, we look at documentation, we look at compliance,” Kubicek said.
He said Dew concurrently served as executive director of a separate organization in Iowa also dedicated to people with disabilities, and that Dew declined the Nebraska auditor team access to the Iowa payroll records. Based on that, Kubicek said his team figured it would get nowhere if it asked Dew for input on the Nebraska review, so it didn’t.
Meanwhile, Faltys said she is effectively acting also as executive director and pushing to add more voting board members. 
Herself a quadriplegic, she said the organization is more important than most understand. It works with state partners to develop Nebraska’s three-year plan for independent living and community based services. It supports research, education and reforms related to disability issues.
Without it, advocates said, certain federal funding could not flow to groups such as the League of Human Dignity and Independence Rising. Faltys said the availability of the services and accountability of the organization should matter to all. 
“Everyone is a moment away from being disabled,” Faltys said. “You could have a stroke, a car accident, these are issues vital to everyone.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)An Iowa ag company accused of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme is being sued by a lender that says 110,000 piglets in South Dakota are at risk of starvation.
Compeer Financial of Minnesota is suing Sunterra Farms Iowa Inc., Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. in U.S. District Court. Compeer alleges that the three defendants operate extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, and have granted Compeer, their lender, exclusive security over their collective assets.
Compeer is asking the court to appoint a receiver to take control of the defendants’ assets so that Compeer can protect its collateral by continuing to provide for the feeding and care of 110,000 head of swine.
The defendant companies are allegedly operated by the Price family of South Dakota, including Ray, Art and Glen Price, who own and manage 110,000 head of swine in 54 barns located in and around Yankton County, South Dakota. The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra.

Compeer claims in the lawsuit that because of what it calls “the long-running fraud” perpetrated by the defendant companies, they cannot be trusted to operate their businesses and protect their assets, including the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County.
According to the lawsuit, the three defendant companies have engaged in check kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.
Compeer’s lawsuit claims that earlier this year, the defendant companies were issuing each other numerous checks, in nearly identical amounts, on a daily basis — with some checks ranging from $800,000 to $990,000, an amount just below the threshold that would trigger scrutiny from regulators.
The transactions had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest, the lawsuit claims.
Compeer alleges that on Feb. 12, 2025, the day after it asked Ray Price, the CEO of the defendant companies, about the transactions, it received a batch of checks totaling $9 million drawn one of the defendants’ Canadian bank accounts for deposit into the defendants’ account with Compeer.
Later that day, the lawsuit claims, Ray Price admitted that the checks were intended only to prevent the Compeer account from being overdrawn, and acknowledged that if Compeer attempted to deposit the $9 million it would trigger a corresponding overdraft in the Canadian account. According to the lawsuit, Price admitted that what the companies were doing was “wrong.”
About 24 hours later, the lawsuit claims, Price spoke to Compeer personnel and said the Canadian account was overdrawn by roughly $21 million, adding that he needed Compeer to immediately “send the money back” to the Canadian bank to cover the overdraft. Compeer refused.
In late February, the lawsuit alleges, Compeer learned the Canadian bank had rejected 65 checks totaling $59.9 million previously credited by Compeer to the defendants’ accounts. As a result, the defendants’ $21 million positive cash balance at Compeer was instantly wiped out and replaced with a $36 million debt owed by the defendants to Compeer.
In its lawsuit, Compeer alleges that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions.
Court records show that on March 17, 2025, the Canadian bank asked that a receiver be appointed to look after the defendants’ assets. However, the listed assets in that case didn’t include the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County, or the 370,000 head owned by third parties and managed by Sunterra.
In court filings, Compeer says that over the past several weeks, it has provided funds necessary for the care and feeding of the Yankton County pigs, but says it is no longer willing to do so “while the parties who perpetrated this fraudulent scheme” remain in control of Sunterra, Sunwold and Lariagra.
“These swine are in imminent danger of starvation if feed is not promptly purchased and delivered to barns housing the pigs,” the lawsuit states, adding that workers hired to provide for the animals’ care may soon walk off the job given the Price family’s inability to make payroll.
If court appoints a receiver, Compeer states in its court filings, it will advance the money necessary to protect its collateral and prevent the animals’ starvation.
The Price family has not yet responded to the lawsuit and Sunserra declined comment. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for fraud and unjust enrichment. The lawsuit was initially filed in South Dakota state court before being transferred to federal court.

(Photo provided by Wells County Emergency Management)The Federal Emergency Management Agency canceled more than $20 million in grants that were headed to North Dakota for various infrastructure projects.
The funding comes from the agency’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program, designed to help state and local governments with projects that reduce risks to hazards.
Some projects impacted in North Dakota are a $7.1 million for a water intake project in Washburn; $7.8 million for a regional wastewater treatment project in Lincoln; and $1.9 million for a wastewater lagoon project in Fessenden. 
“This is devastating for our community. Two million dollars to a little community of 450 people is huge,” said Tammy Roehrich, emergency manager for Wells County.
Health agencies scramble as North Dakota loses federal grants

North Dakota has 10 projects that were authorized for the federal funding but those dollars will be rescinded, the North Dakota Department of Emergency Services said Tuesday. Additional projects are going through a re-review process and could potentially lose funding as well.
In an April 4 statement, a FEMA spokesperson said: “The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.”
In Wells County, the grant was going to help prevent erosion in Fessenden’s lagoon, which is over 100 years old.
“We were going to open bids May 1,” Roehrich said. “We were shovel ready.”
Planning for the project began in 2020 and the county was awaiting the final grant paperwork from FEMA after the agency toured the project site in June 2024.
Funding the project locally would require increasing property taxes by $6,000 on each Wells County homeowner, Roehrich said.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong has directed state agencies to work with local communities to explore other funding solutions, according to a Tuesday news release.
Other funding options for Fessenden could include a $1 million loan the community could pay back over 30 years, Roehrich said. 
“For every dollar of mitigation spent in North Dakota, we’re saving six to seven dollars,” Roehrich said. “It’s a huge savings so the cost-benefit is there.”
Sen. Jerry Klein, R-Fessenden, said FEMA was dragging its feet on finalizing the Fessenden grant award and now it feels like the rug was pulled out from under them. He added additional service fees were added to the utility bills of local residents in recent months to help with the project.
“I’ve been out to the lagoon. I know it’s in dire need,” Klein said. “It’s unfortunate. Some of these projects, there was a promise and now that promise is being kind of like, ‘Here it is, but we really didn’t mean it.’”
Klein said it will be hard for the state to fill the funding gaps left by the loss of federal grants.
Sen. Brad Bekkedahl, R-Williston, chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said  lawmakers would be able to look into funding options while the Legislature is still in session, but they can’t plan for cuts that haven’t happened yet, or haven’t come to light.
“Anything that comes now that is going to impact appropriations that are necessary for public safety, we’ll obviously look at that,” Bekkedahl said. “I can’t guarantee that it’ll be funded and I can’t guarantee where we’ll find the funding because we’re still overspent at this point, but I think as long as we’re here, we’ll have those discussions.”
Bekkedahl said local subdivisions should contact the governor’s office to make sure their federal funding losses are cataloged.

Michelle Lujan Grisham to enact a privacy law they say would restore trust in public data systems that handle sensitive personal information.
Senate Bill 36 would prohibit, for instance, state Motor Vehicle Division employees from disclosing driver’s license data to any entity that would use it to enforce federal civil immigration laws. That includes requiring private companies that buy MVD data to certify they won’t use the data in service of deporting immigrants who aren’t accused of crimes.
When immigrant New Mexicans apply for their driver’s licenses, they must  disclose their photos, addresses and other identifying information, said SB36 co-sponsor Rep. Christina Parajón (D-Albuquerque) during debate in the House of Representatives on March 18.
Doing so makes them part of “one of the most useful data systems available currently to law enforcement, and we want to ensure that everyone continues to use this data system,” Parajón said.
Leaders of 21 different domestic violence, sexual assault and crime victim service organizations in New Mexico signed a letter to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday urging her to sign SB36 into law. They wrote that the bill is “critical to advancing public safety, protecting survivor privacy and maintaining trust in the systems survivors must rely on to find safety and healing.”
The letter comes as the U.S. Internal Revenue Service and Department of Homeland Security agree to share tax information of immigrants who have final orders of removal to help immigration agents find and deport the immigrants.
The bill also would also create a uniform policy for all state agencies and their employees that would limit the intentional disclosure of someone’s sensitive information like sexual orientation or their status as a crime victim.
The letter states that survivors of domestic violence and sexual assault often take great personal risk in seeking help, and a foundational part of helping them is ensuring that their personal, sensitive information remains confidential. Survivors depend on access to state-issued identification, driver’s licenses and essential services to maintain their independence, the letter states.
“When systems share or use survivor data without their informed consent, it jeopardizes not only their safety but also the safety of our communities,” the letter states. “Without clear protections for their personal data, these lifelines become sources of danger. SB36 ensures that state systems do not become another failed link in the safety net.”
The groups published the letter in a news release on Tuesday morning, after the governor’s office announced late Monday that she signed a list of five dozen bills from which SB36 was absent.
A spokesperson for Lujan Grisham told Source NM on Tuesday the governor’s office received the letter and staff was reviewing it.
“The Legislative Session represents a cornerstone of our democratic process, and we deeply value every New Mexican’s voice and participation,” Deputy Director of Communications Jodi McGinnis Porter said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to the letter, SB36 would remove  barriers that prevent survivors from reporting abuse, seeking restraining orders or engaging with the criminal legal system.
New Mexico Coalition Against Domestic Violence Executive Director Mary Ellen Garcia, who signed the letter, told Source NM in an interview on Tuesday that under the current law, someone can ask for the information directly from MVD, or find it in databases run by companies that have purchased the data from MVD.
Garcia said acquiring state-issued identification cards improves safety for survivors, because they need ID to access a protection order from a court, for example. A survivor trying to protect themselves doesn’t want their perpetrator to find their information just because they handed it to MVD in order to get an ID, she said.
“As New Mexicans, we want to ensure that the systems we use don’t also have us thinking about how they are going to be used against us,” Garcia said.
Another person who signed the letter, Enlace Comunitario Executive Director Sara Yvonne “Bonnie” Escobar, said in a statement that by signing SB36 into law, Lujan Grisham “would be taking an important step in ensuring that all New Mexicans—including vulnerable immigrant communities — are protected.”
Escobar’s organization serves Latine and immigrant domestic violence survivors.
“SB36 ensures that all New Mexicans can access essential services with confidence, knowing their sensitive data is protected,” Escobar said.
Marcela Díaz, founding executive director of Somos un Pueblo Unido, told Source NM in a phone interview on Tuesday that SB36 would replace the existing “patchwork” of privacy and confidentiality policies in New Mexico. For example, the cities of Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Las Cruces already have local policies preventing their employees from sharing sensitive personal information, she said.
“There are so many different kinds of services that victims need to access to support their families and their communities,” Díaz said. “They just want to know that their most vulnerable information will be protected, and this will give them peace of mind.”

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed four bills into law Tuesday, April 8, relating to water and PFAS. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Tuesday signed into law four bills she said better prepares New Mexico to address: water shortages from climate change; contamination from so-called “forever chemicals;” and pollution in the state’s waters.
At a press conference at the Roundhouse joined by sponsors, advocates and several cabinet secretaries, the governor signed:

House Bill 137, which will explore treatment of salty water from deep aquifers for future use.
House Bill 212, which tasks state environment officials to create rules phasing out consumer products containing a class of toxic so-called “forever chemicals,” called per-and-polyfluoroalkyl substances or PFAS.
House Bill 140 to expand New Mexico Environment Department’s authority to require the cleanup of firefighting foams containing PFAS in response to litigation from the U.S. military over cleanup at military bases in New Mexico.
Senate Bill 21, a bill to expand New Mexico’s powers to address stream pollution and take over pollution permitting in surface waters from the federal government.

“When you talk about water to anyone, it’s typically not a dialogue, it’s a debate, because water is life,” Lujan Grisham said during the bill signing, adding that the Legislature and her office “did about three decades worth of work” on the issue over the session.
New Mexico Environment Secretary James Kenney called the four bills “a big, bold package,” for the environment.
“This is a real turning point, I think, for taking back control of our water, of what consumer products are coming into our homes, of teaching people how to treat New Mexico and its environment,” Kenney said.
Lujan Grisham also celebrated the passage of HB137, the much pared down Strategic Water Supply, crediting state Rep. Susan Herrera (D-Embudo) for sponsoring the bill. HB137 addresses aquifer mapping and treatment of brackish water in deep aquifers, and funding for mapping the state’s groundwater supplies.
Previous and more controversial versions of the bill included efforts to treat oil and gas wastewater, which environmental, Indigenous and conservation nonprofits opposed due to potential health and logistical risks. A previous version of the bill also installed fees for oil and gas producers per barrel of oil and gas wastewater to help pay for the program, but those also were stripped from the bill.
“This is a monumental stake in identifying water and keeping our fresh water fresh and clean and making sure that we can do both economic development and create assurances for any number of industries, including ag in the future,” Lujan Grisham said of the bill, and noted she plans to push for developing treatment for oil and gas wastewater in next year’s 30-day session.
“I think we should clean up every bit of contaminated water, wherever it exists, from uranium mill tailings to produced water, all of it,” Lujan Grisham said, adding that the costs should be paid for by the oil and gas industry.
The governor also applauded the Legislature’s work in passing SB21, a bill to enshrine the state’s right to regulate pollution in surface waters like streams and rivers and continue the yearslong process to develop a state program for permits. New Mexico was one of only three states that allowed the federal government to handle all pollution permitting in surface waters.
SB21 allows the state to reinstate protections for more than 90% of New Mexico’s waters which were stripped by the Supreme Court decision in Sackett v. EPA.
Paula Garcia, the executive director of the New Mexico Acequia Association, told Source NM the laws will reinstall meaningful protections for the tributary waters on which irrigators rely, but that the organization will ensure there’s follow-through in the yearslong process for the state to take over permitting.
“We have to stay vigilant to ensure the state’s environment department has the resources that the need to stand up this program,” Garcia said.
It was a much warmer mood on the fourth floor, compared to the somber end of the legislative session, which occurred in the aftermath of the Las Cruces mass shooting on March 21 and prompted criticism from the governor on legislative inaction regarding juvenile crime reform.
Lujan Grisham said on Tuesday a special session on juvenile crime is still under discussion, but a specific date has not been set. She said perhaps later this year after interim committee meetings begin.
“I’m still feeling like that’s really necessary,” she said.
In the upcoming 30-day session, the governor said she’d fight for a law codifying greenhouse gas emission reductions by 2050, which she issued as an executive order in 2019. This year’s version, Senate Bill 4, sponsored by Senate Pro Tem Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), failed to advance beyond Senate Finance this year.
She emphasized that her administration is running out of time.
“It’s the last chance, and people should expect me to have a little bit better than a scalpel approach, a little bit less than a sledgehammer about where we’re going in climate change,” Lujan Grisham said.

Lucke joins Lantern freelancers Deborah Yetter, Tom Loftus and Jack Brammer, television trailblazer Barbara Bailey, Pulitzer Prize administrator Dana Canedy and many others in the high distinction. 
In an acceptance speech in the Gatton Student Center on the University of Kentucky’s campus, Lucke spoke to the importance of journalism now and in the future. 
“So much is on the line, including that thing that’s at the very top of the rights of citizens,” Lucke said. “And that is an independent, free press.” 
She also said nonprofit journalism, such as the Kentucky Lantern and its parent, States Newsroom, are imperative to the future of journalism. This organization, she said, is “one reason I’m hopeful.” 
“The number one essential ingredient in a democracy, as written in the highest law in our land, is an informed citizenry,” Lucke said. “An independent, free press may have never been as imperiled as it is right now. It’s also never been as needed.”

During Tuesday’s ceremony, Duane Bonifer, the president of the UK Alumni Association, praised the inductees for their “relentless quest for truth, fairness and fidelity to high moral and ethical ideals.” 
“They believe that no matter how fierce the political winds of the moment might glow, there are certain timeless principles and values that the free people should not abandon, principles and values such as honesty and openness, the freedom of inquiry and speech, the pursuit of knowledge and the respect of facts and the rule of law and the belief that when organizations embrace inclusion, diversity and equity and don’t flee from them…they are extending opportunities and welcoming all people into our larger society.” 
Before States Newsroom, the Lantern’s parent nonprofit, chose Lucke to launch the Kentucky Lantern in 2022, she was a longtime reporter and editorial writer for the Lexington Herald-Leader. 
Lucke attended the University of Kentucky and graduated from the School of Journalism in 1976. 
Lucke is part of this year’s class of five, including Kentucky Educational Television’s Renee Shaw, longtime Courier Journal reporter Stephen J. Ford, University of Kentucky Television/Radio Network host and announcer Dick Gabriel and Lexington Herald-Leader photojournalist Ron Garrison.
The University of Kentucky Journalism Alumni Association founded the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame in 1980 and inducts members every year. Those in the Hall must be “natives of Kentucky or journalists who have spent a significant portion of their careers in Kentucky,” according to the College of Communication.

Josh Shapiro and Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding speak to reporters after addressing members of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Warning new tariffs threaten an “economic calamity,” Gov. Josh Shapiro pledged to protect Pennsylvania farmers, who were hit hard during President Donald Trump’s first term when U.S. trading partners placed retaliatory duties on agricultural exports.
Shapiro highlighted his administration’s investments in agriculture as part of a statewide economic development plan in remarks to members of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau. Farms and associated businesses employ 600,000 people and contribute $132 billion to the commonwealth’s economy each year, Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding noted before the speech.
While the state Department of Agriculture has helped farmers weather highly contagious avian influenza that decimated chicken flocks and threatened dairy herds, the Trump administration’s tariffs have brought greater uncertainty and peril, Shapiro said. 
“I’m not sure why the Trump administration is looking to screw over our farmers,” Shapiro told reporters after his speech. “We have their backs, and we’re going to protect them.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Trump on April 2 announced broad tariffs on imports from other nations, triggering stock sell-offs around the world as investors responded to uncertainty over how businesses would respond. 
The tariffs make it more expensive for U.S. businesses to import products and materials from other countries. They’re based on the difference between the value of goods exported to and imported from another country and range from 10% to 104% on Chinese imports as officials there vowed to “fight to the end.”
“For all of the talk about bringing companies and industries back to the United States, our farmers are already here,” Shapiro said. “They’re already doing business in this commonwealth and in this country, and I believe they are being unnecessarily hurt by these trade wars.”
As other countries consider and impose reciprocal tariffs, Pennsylvania farm products become more expensive for buyers abroad, eroding hard-won markets and decreasing sales, Shapiro said.
“Understand, this is not theoretical and this is not some political statement. This is the reality, and you’ve already lived through it,” Shapiro said, recalling that in 2018 Trump’s tariffs on aluminum and steel prompted retaliatory duties on U.S. agricultural exports causing lost income for farmers.
“The first Trump administration was forced to make $27 billion in payments for lost income to farmers in Pennsylvania and all across the United States,” Shapiro said “All of the tariffs that were raised back then went to paying farmers for lost market share.”
The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimated that Pennsylvania agricultural exports decreased by about $66 million in 2018 and 2019.

And such losses are not easily recouped, Shapiro said, noting that Pennsylvania is the top exporter of hardwood products. But since 2017, U.S. production of hardwood lumber decreased 50% as a result of turmoil created by retaliatory tariffs, he said.
“That means fewer jobs in the hardwood industry here at home in Pennsylvania,” Shapiro said.
Pennsylvania’s dairy industry could also be affected by retaliatory tariffs by Mexico, where commonwealth  farmers sell $170 million in dairy products each year.
Shapiro also addressed a planned $25 million reduction in funding for the state’s bird flu recovery fund. It’s reimbursed farmers $13 million for the cost of responding to outbreaks, leaving $61 million in reserve, which he said is “more than enough to meet the needs of our poultry farmers and see them through this crisis.”
“Should we need more, you have my word, I will be there to make sure our poultry farmers have what they need to get back up on their feet again,” Shapiro said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3859-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-08 20:05:20.552809

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A bill to establish public charter schools in North Dakota passed the House on a 64-29 vote Tuesday.
Senate Bill 2241 would allow the establishment of public charter schools in North Dakota. These schools would be under the same regulations as public schools, but operate outside the school district and be administered by their own internal governing boards, once established.
“It’s so exciting to think about the potential of what this could do in North Dakota,” said Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, chief sponsor of the bill.
The charter schools would not be able to charge tuition or teach religious curriculum. The schools would need to come to a performance agreement with the Department of Public Instruction and meet or exceed academic and graduation benchmarks set by the department. 
The schools would receive state funding, about $8,160 per student for 2024-25, and could receive federal grants or donations. Charter schools would not be allowed to use the state’s school building fund.
  Rep. Larry Klemin, R-Bismarck, speaks on the House floor on Feb. 25, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)
Rep. Larry Klemin, R-Bismarck, voted against the bill and raised concerns that the per pupil payments to charter schools could be used for its construction and building maintenance. 
“In a sense, we’re going to be supporting public schools and charter schools through the payment of our taxes,” Klemin said.
Others said it would divert money from public schools and create funding problems around the state, especially in rural areas with fewer students.
“We have one pie and the state slices that pie for the different programs,” said Rep. Donald Longmuir, R-Stanley. “And if they slice a piece of that pie away to public charters, that takes away from the public schools.”
He added no one from his district has sent him any messages that they need a public charter school. Longmuir voted against the bill.
Axtman said she thinks rural communities could benefit from public charter schools because some rural schools at risk of closing could reorganize as a public charter.
She also stressed that charter schools will only go to communities that want them.
“If a rural community doesn’t have the support or the need for a charter school, it simply won’t open there,” Axtman said.
The overall fiscal impact of the bill is unclear. If students from traditional public K-12 schools switch to charter schools, the state would spend less to educate those students in per pupil payments. However, if private school or homeschool students begin attending public charter schools, the cost to the state would increase.
Senate Bill 2241 was approved by the Senate in February on a 40-7 vote.
The bill will now travel back to the Senate to concur with the House’s amended bill. If approved, it will go to the governor’s desk for his signature.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An appropriation for a new 3,000-bed state prison failed to pass the Arkansas Senate for the fifth time on Tuesday, despite gaining support from earlier holdouts.
Senate Bill 354 aims to appropriate three-quarters of a billion dollars for the prison. But the $750 million measure has been stuck in the Senate for a week as the legislative session barrels to a projected close on April 16. 
Sen. John Payton, who previously voted against the measure, joined 20 of his colleagues in supporting SB 354 Tuesday because he said the executive branch addressed some of his concerns, including potential staffing issues.
Prison appropriation bill remains stuck in Arkansas Senate

Noting the success of a steel mill in rural Mississippi County in attracting roughly 2,000 employees, Payton said state officials have demonstrated their ability to recruit workers from long distances. He also credited Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders for construction of a new state crime lab that he said is ahead of schedule and expected to come in under budget. 
“I still can’t promise you or guarantee you that it will be a success…but I can say that I’m willing to trust and give ‘em a chance because they’ve proven to me that they have done their homework,” Payton said. 
The Wilburn Republican said he voted present the last two times as he processed the new information he received and ultimately chose to cast an affirmative vote Tuesday because he doesn’t want to be the deciding vote. Sen. Dan Sullivan, a Jonesboro Republican who has previously cast votes for, against and present, again cast an affirmative vote for SB 354 Tuesday, bringing the total to 21 votes for the bill.
While that’s the most support SB 354 has received thus far, an appropriation bill requires a three-fourths majority or 27 votes to advance out of the Senate. 
The proposal to construct a prison in rural Franklin County has caused controversy for months because local community members said they were blindsided by Sanders’ announcement that the state spent about $3 million to purchase 815 acres near Charleston for the prison last fall. 
Supporters of the project, including Sanders, say the prison is needed to address overcrowding in county jails, which house state inmates because of a shortage of beds in state facilities. Opponents have criticized a lack of transparency and the cost of the project, an estimated $825 million. They’ve also questioned the feasibility of the construction site and the ability to attract a sufficient workforce. 
Sen. Bryan King, a Green Forest Republican who has adamantly opposed the prison from the start, on the Senate floor Tuesday argued the state “embarrassingly” has one of the highest incarceration rates in the country because Arkansas has high crime rates. If crime isn’t stopped on the front end, Arkansas will end up “in a financial death spiral” because the state won’t be able to build enough prisons to incarcerate sufficient people to escape it, King said. 
“I’d still appreciate a no vote because we are not holistically taking care of the problem,” he said. “This thing of building prisons and incarceration rates, if we don’t take care of the crime rate first, it’s like putting out the smoke instead of putting out the fire.” 


Let us know what you think...


 

Sen. Breanne Davis, a Russellville Republican who has consistently voted in favor of SB 354, challenged an assertion by King that incarceration should be more of a shared partnership between the state and counties. King has repeatedly said larger counties that contribute to the majority of the state’s inmates need to do more. 
The populations of jails and prisons are different, according to Davis who said the issue with overcrowding is that local law enforcement officials don’t have a place to put people they need to arrest. 
“I believe that would show that we need a facility to house prisoners so that people that are committing crimes that deserve to be in county jail, which again is different than prison, have a place to be in county jail; otherwise we just have criminals roaming the streets,” she said. “I’ve got four kids. I mean I want to have a safe community, and we’ve got law enforcement officers, but we’ve got nowhere to put people who are committing crimes. So we’re just turning them out, letting them go.”
King agreed there’s a difference between county jails and prisons, but he still had problems with the Franklin County prison project, including its estimated cost and his concerns that it won’t adequately address mental health issues. 
King was one of nine senators who voted against SB 354 Tuesday, one fewer than Monday. Cabot Republican Sen. Ricky Hill, who has consistently voted against the bill, changed his vote to present Tuesday. 
SB 354’s lead sponsor, Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, told the Advocate Monday he intends to run his bill every day until lawmakers conclude their work on April 16. 
If the measure fails to gain enough support by the end of the legislative session, Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, last week said he expects the governor to call a special session to secure the funding, according to the Saline Courier.

,DC,2025-04-08 22:59:27+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Trump signs orders targeting revival of ‘beautiful, clean coal’",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-signs-orders-targeting-revival-beautiful-clean-coal,,"President Donald Trump signed four executive orders Tuesday aiming to invigorate the U.S. coal industry.In wide-ranging comments in front of a phalanx of coal miners at the White House, Trump said the orders would revitalize an industry pushed to the brink by Democratic policies that encourage renewable energy.“This is a very important day to me, because we're bringing back an industry that was abandoned, despite the fact that it was just about the best, certainly the best in terms of power, real power,” Trump said.The orders:End a moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining;Remove Biden administration environmental regulations that Trump said slow approvals of new mining projects;Prioritize grid security and reliability; andDirect the U.S. Justice Department to block states from enforcing their own regulations on coal.Two of the orders cite increased energy demand for the power-intensive task of artificial intelligence data processing as the rationale for increasing coal production.Reopening plans for mines in Montana, WyomingA press release from the Interior Department, which oversees resource management on public lands, added that one of the orders reopens plans to build mines in Montana and Wyoming, removes regulatory burdens on coal production and lowers royalty rates coal companies owe for production on federal lands.Environmental groups cautioned against a renewed federal investment in coal and took particular exception to the provision allowing the federal government to undermine state efforts to move away from the sector.“Reviving or extending coal to power data centers would force working families to subsidize polluting coal on behalf of Big Tech billionaires and despoil our nation’s public lands,” Tyson Slocum, the energy policy director for the liberal advocacy group Public Citizen, said in a statement. “States planning to move to cleaner, cheaper energy sources could be forced to keep old coal plants up and running for years, forcing nearby residents to breathe dirty air and harming the climate.”In a line that appeared ad-libbed, Trump also promised the orders could not be reversed by a future president.“We're going to give a guarantee that the business will not be terminated by the ups and downs of the world of politics,” he said. “We're going to give a guarantee that it's not going to happen, so that if somebody comes in, they cannot change it at a whim.”Trump said he’d thought of the idea “about 15 minutes before” getting on stage at the White House.‘Beautiful, clean coal’Trump cast the move as a direct rebuke to his Democratic predecessors, Joe Biden and Barack Obama, and said it was in service of restoring working-class jobs in states like West Virginia.“We're ending Joe Biden's war on beautiful, clean coal once and for all. And it wasn't just Biden, it was Obama and others, but we're doing the exact opposite… We're going to put the miners back to work.”

A 2024 Biden rule to raise emissions standards on coal plants was unworkable, one of the orders, which reversed the Biden rule, said.“The Rule requires compliance with standards premised on the application of emissions-control technologies that do not yet exist in a commercially viable form,” the order said. “The Rule therefore raises the unacceptable risk of the shutdown of many coal-fired power plants, eliminating thousands of jobs, placing our electrical grid at risk, and threatening broader, harmful economic and energy security effects.”With both U.S. senators from West Virginia, Republicans Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, on hand, Trump said the state’s workers rejected Democrats’ vision of transitioning away from their mining identity.“One thing I learned about the coal miners is that's what they want to do,” he said. “You could give them a penthouse on Fifth Avenue in a different kind of a job, but they'd be unhappy. They want to mine coal. That's what they love to do.”Environmental groups slam ordersEven before the orders were signed, environmental advocacy groups panned them as a giveaway to the industry and a reckless move away from attention to the climate crisis.“Trump’s coal orders take his worship of dirty fossil fuels to a gross and disturbingly reckless new level,” Jason Rylander, the legal director of the environmental group Center for Biological Diversity’s Climate Law Institute, said in a written statement. “This is yet another assault on efforts to preserve a livable climate.”Lena Moffitt, the executive director of environmental group Evergreen Action, said true energy reliability would come from renewable sources.“Coal is toxic and outdated,” Mofitt said in a statement. “It poisons our air and water, jacks up household energy bills, and is deadly for communities living under the shadow of its smokestacks. If Trump actually cared about meeting rising energy demand, he’d invest in affordable, clean power—not drag us backward to prop up a dying industry.”Immigration and tariffsTrump spoke for about 45 minutes and touched on issues beyond energy policy, including his recently enacted tariffs that have rocked world financial markets and the case of a Maryland man erroneously swept up in a deportation operation.Trump promoted his aggressive immigration policy and referenced the case of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a man who the administration has admitted was mistakenly deported from Maryland to his native El Salvador despite being granted legal protection to remain in the United States.The administration sent planeloads of Venezuelan nationals to an El Salvador mega-prison last month, accusing them of being members of the gang Tren de Aragua.Without naming Abrego Garcia, Trump referenced a man sent to El Salvador who was not a member of the Venezuelan gang, but said he was a member of a different Latin American gang.

Jon Eubanks (left), R-Paris, before the House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee on Tuesday, April 8, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)An Arkansas House committee approved a bill Tuesday that would allow households receiving food stamps to save more of their income or own more assets.
Arkansas is one of 13 states with an asset limit for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) recipients, and the state aligns with the federal limit of $3,000. House Bill 1915 would double the limit to $6,000 and require it to be adjusted for inflation every two years.
The House Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee passed the bill on a split voice vote. On Thursday, committee members said they were hesitant to vote without knowing how much the policy would cost the state.
The administrative cost to the Department of Human Services would be $87,500, according to the requested fiscal impact statement from the agency.
DHS Secretary Kristi Putnam told the committee she still opposed the bill, repeating her statement from Thursday that the state should let Act 675 of 2023 take effect first.
Act 675 kept the federal asset limit but authorized a USDA waiver request to allow exemptions for individual families with more assets. Those families would have a new asset limit of $5,500 and remain enrolled in SNAP as long as they receive an exemption within a year of exceeding the current limit, and they would only be allowed one exemption every five years.

Advocates for child well-being call for removal of barriers to Arkansas SNAP participation

 

Assets include cash on hand and in the bank, savings certificates and stocks and bonds, among other things. HB 1915 would repeal Act 675 and replace it with the $6,000 asset limit.
Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, sponsored Act 675 and is sponsoring HB 1915. He expressed frustration in January and again last week that DHS has not yet implemented Act 675. The Arkansas Legislative Council’s Executive Subcommittee approved an emergency rule Thursday to enact the policy.
Earlier versions of Act 675 would have raised the asset limit to $12,500 and then to $6,000. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at the time that she opposed making people more dependent on government benefits, a sentiment echoed Thursday by Opportunity Arkansas CEO Nicholas Horton and Tuesday by Nick Stehle, a visiting fellow at FGA Action.
Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, is HB 1915’s House sponsor and told the Public Health committee that the bill will give SNAP recipients a path to no longer needing food stamps.
Rep. Aaron Pilkington, R-Knoxville, said he supported providing “off-ramps” for Arkansans on government assistance, based on his past work with Section 8 housing assistance recipients.
“They would get a job, they’re working, they’re doing everything we want them to do, but then unfortunately they would get a promotion and potentially would lose their housing, so they wouldn’t take the promotion,” Pilkington said.

 Public testimony

Three members of the public spoke in favor of HB 1915, with two saying they personally benefited from SNAP and saw the asset limit as a barrier to developing financial stability and food security.
Brittany Stockton told the committee she enrolled herself and her three daughters in public assistance a few years ago after leaving a dangerous situation.
“Had we had savings, we would have been better off, but I wouldn’t have been eligible for the benefits that I had,” said Stockton, who added that she has worked two jobs for two years and no longer qualifies for benefits.
Holly Skipper said she also works two jobs and had to reduce her hours at one of them in order to receive SNAP benefits, which she received on Saturday, four months after applying. She is both a full-time student and a full-time caregiver for her husband and adult son, the latter of whom receives disability benefits, she said.
“Not only did I have to account for every dime that I was making in the two part-time jobs I had, plus school, plus my son’s money, but I spent days and days crying, wondering which job I was going to have to quit so that I could afford to be able to feed my son and feed my partner,” Skipper said.
Because of the SNAP asset limit, DHS required Skipper to explain why she owns a vehicle before approving her application; she explained she needs it to get her husband to his medical appointments, she said.
“People aren’t just out there trying to stay down,” Skipper said. “We’re trying to get some help, and we’re trying to get a leg up so we can help other people.”
New report ranks Arkansas’ food insecurity rate worst in the U.S.

The federal asset limit of $3,000 isn’t even one month’s worth of savings in case of an emergency, said Christin Harper, policy director for Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families, the third person to speak for the bill. AACF called for the removal of the asset limit in a January report.
Harper reminded the committee that Arkansas has the nation’s highest rate of food insecurity, at nearly 19% in 2023, according to a U.S. Department of Agriculture report released in September. The report defines food insecurity as being unable, at some time during the year, to provide adequate food for one or more household members because of a lack of resources.
Food insecurity for Arkansas children is higher at 24.2%, which accounts for more than 168,000 children, according to Feeding America.
Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance Advocacy Director Lance Whitney expressed support for HB 1915 last week.
The full House is expected to vote on HB 1915 Wednesday.

As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high. A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. [&#8230;]","People stand outside of a Mennonite church in Seminole after a funeral for an 8-year-old girl  who died of measles on Sunday, April 6, 2025.Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
 Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.












Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health




Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
 State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

(Jim Max for the Idaho Capital Sun)President Donald Trump has nominated longtime Republican Idaho state lawmaker and attorney Bart Davis to return to his role as U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho.
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Davis would be returning to a position he previously held, in the first Trump administration, as the top federal prosecuting attorney in Idaho.
“It’s an honor. It certainly is,” Davis told the Idaho Capital Sun in a phone interview Tuesday. “I really, really, really enjoyed my service as the U.S. Attorney. Idaho has a remarkable U.S. Attorney’s Office.”
New presidents often replace U.S. District attorneys upon changes in administration.
In February 2021, Davis resigned as U.S. Attorney for Idaho — a position he’d served in since 2017  — at the request of the Biden administration, the Post Register reported. Idaho’s most recent U.S. Attorney, Josh Hurwit, ended his service in February, the office announced. Hurwit was nominated by former U.S. President Joe Biden.
Davis’s re-appointment was first reported by the Idaho Statesman. 
The current acting U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho is Justin D. Whatcott, a longtime Idaho prosecutor. 
Before Davis became Idaho’s top federal prosecutor, he served for nearly two decades in the Idaho Senate — including over a decade as the Senate majority leader. 
If confirmed by the U.S. Senate, Davis’s term as U.S. Attorney for the District of Idaho would be four years. 
The White House announced Davis’s nomination on April 1. His nomination has been referred to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
In an interview, Davis praised the office’s staff as solid and “a pleasure to work with.” And he said the office’s relationships with federal law enforcement, and state and local partners, have helped make the office “very effective in the work that they do.”
“It’s going to be quite a privilege to go back and work with those people,” he added.
Davis is the fourth Idahoan nominated to positions in the Trump administration.

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Nearly 50 health organizations signed a letter urging the Kansas governor to veto a budget provision that would end continuous eligibility in the state’s Medicaid program, which allows public health insurance enrollees to consistently access health care.
If allowed to become law, the budget provision would require the state to evaluate parents and caregivers who receive coverage under KanCare, as Medicaid is known in Kansas, to be evaluated every month instead of every year. Currently, eligible enrollees are covered under KanCare for an entire year once approved, regardless of any change in circumstances during that time.
The Hutchinson-based United Methodist Health Ministry Fund drafted the letter, which was delivered Tuesday to Gov. Laura Kelly with signatures from 48 organizations. David Jordan, president and CEO of the health fund, said allowing the provision to pass could mean adding between $3-4 million in costs to the state and lost health insurance coverage for low-income families.
An estimated 38,000 Kansans would be impacted by the change, the letter said.
“This change will affect the most vulnerable Kansans who live well below the poverty line,” the letter said. “The constant dis-enrollment and re-enrollment of beneficiaries is burdensome for everyone and could prevent families from receiving the necessary care they need.”
Kansas has used continuous eligibility since 2010.
In order to qualify for KanCare, households must remain below income thresholds. A family of four, for instance, cannot exceed an annual income of roughly $11,800.
“These families already have enough challenges on their plates without the added burden of continuously reapplying for health insurance,” the letter said.
Research has shown that continuous eligibility reduces financial barriers for low-income families, improves health outcomes and gives states the ability to exercise accountability measures.
Other signers of the letter included advocacy health care providers, patient groups, foundations like United Methodist Health Ministry Fund and advocacy groups like Kansas Action for Children.
Adrienne Olejnik, vice president of Kansas Action for Children, said the organization is concerned.
“Not only is this a waste of money on administrative costs, but it would also cause health care disruptions and delays based on small changes in income,” she said.
Olejnik said the Senate Ways and Means Committee added the provision to a budget bill at the last minute. She said she hopes a veto from the governor will allow lawmakers to fully consider the weight of the change.
Kelly, whose office declined to comment for this story, has until Thursday to veto line items in the budget. The Legislature’s two-day veto session also is scheduled to begin Thursday.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Statehouse-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 19:10:32.152778

State and federal records show that in January, the staff at Sanford Senior Care in Sheldon, which is a 70-bed nursing home affiliated with the Sanford Medical Center, found that a male resident of the home had developed a reddened area on his coccyx. The staff failed to assess and treat the situation or notify the man’s family or physician — even after it developed into an open sore in February, according to inspectors.
A nurse aide later told state inspectors that she informed a nurse on March 4 that the area around the wound “looked like hamburger” and there was blood seeping through the white cream the staff had applied to the wound. The aide reported her observations to a nurse, who later acknowledged to inspectors that she had received the information but was too busy to check the wound herself.

On March 6, the resident was admitted to the hospital’s emergency room with a Stage 4 wound, indicating there was sufficient loss of tissue to result in exposed bone, muscles or tendons, with the potential for a serious complication such as an infection.
The resident died two days later. According to state inspectors, the immediate cause of death was MRSA cellulitis — a dangerous skin infection that stems from staph bacteria — caused by the open wound.
A second nurse aide interviewed by inspectors allegedly reported that the last time she examined the man’s wound “it looked absolutely awful,” and the resident’s overall color was “off” and he appeared gray and purple. “There was bloody skin on both sides of the buttocks and continuing down it looked like hamburger,” the aide reportedly told inspectors.
The facility’s director of nursing allegedly informed inspectors that certain employees were disciplined as a result of the death, adding, “We are trying to do everything possible to prevent this from occurring again.”
Senate passes bill on nursing home reviews, rejects Democrats’ calls for more oversight

Administrator Richard Nordahl referred all questions on the matter to Sanford Health. A spokesperson for the company indicated Tuesday that he was unable to comment on the matter at that time.
No state fines were imposed as a result of the death. Federal records indicate the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services imposed a civil money penalty of some kind, but a CMS spokesperson was unable to say Tuesday what that fine totaled.
CMS’ Care Compare website, which provides information for consumers that is often out of date, indicates Sanford Senior Care in Sheldon has been fined twice in the past three years, most recently in 2024 when it was fined $11,872.
On CMS’ five-star quality scale, the Sheldon facility currently has a one-star overall rating — the lowest possible score.

(Photo by Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images)A proposal that would significantly raise the bar on citizen-led constitutional amendments ever making it on the ballot is headed to the floor of the Florida Senate, where it is expected to pass in that GOP-controlled chamber.
The measure (SB 7016) is one of the most controversial bills proposed in the 2025 legislative session. Gov. Ron DeSantis announced at the beginning of this year that he wanted the Legislature to tighten election laws over alleged signature petition fraud.
The bill passed along party lines in the Senate Fiscal Policy Committee on Tuesday. Slightly amended from its original version, the measure make a number of substantial changes in the rules for those working towards placing a citizen-led constitutional amendment on the ballot.
The process already requires gathering nearly 900,000 signatures by Feb. 1 of the year the measure hopes to be placed on the ballot, and it must pass by a 60% threshold.
Republicans says there is a need for such legislation to combat signature petition fraud. The Office of Election Crimes and Security published a report in January asserting that more than 100 representatives of the group attempting to pass the abortion-rights last year committed crimes related to gathering petitions.
“In these pages are hundreds of specific cases of con artists and fraudsters operating in almost every county of our state,” declared Panhandle Republican Sen. Don Gaetz, a co-sponsor of the measure.
The Election Crimes office last month informed Smart & Safe Florida, the group working to get a constitutional amendment regarding the adult use of cannabis on the 2026 ballot, that the Division of Elections was fining them $121,850 for allegedly submitting petitions more than 30 days after voters signed them — a violation of existing law.
One of the most controversial provisions of the pending Senate measure has been removed: It no longer requires petition sponsors to post bonds of $1 million.
Gaetz said his co-sponsor, Southeast Florida Republican Erin Grall, had learned about how difficult it would be for anyone to acquire such a bond for an organization solely created solely to pass a political measure. “We felt it would be a significant barrier and prohibition to ordinary folks,” he said.
The bill
But other provisions remain, such as:

Requires additional personal identifying information for voters signing petition forms and for petition circulators.
If the percentage of petition forms deemed invalid by a supervisor of elections exceeds 25% in a reporting period, that would trigger an investigation by the Election Crimes office. (Originally the bill called for such a trigger at just 10% of bad petitions, a number criticized by Democrats and voting rights advocates as far too onerous).
Prohibits certain felons and noncitizens from acting as petition circulators and increases fines for late submission or nonsubmission of petition forms.
Requires the sponsor or petition circulator to deliver signed petitions to the supervisors of elections in the counties in which the voter resides within 10 days after the voter signs the form. The sponsors will be fined $50 per each day late that the petition comes in after 10 days. A petition sponsor would be fined $2,500 if they “acted willfully.”
Fines of $100, up to a a maximum of $5,000, for each form collected by a petition circulator and signed by a voter on or before February of the year the general election is held if the sponsor “acted willfully.”
If a person collecting petitions signs another person’s name, the sponsor can be fined $5,000 for each made-up petition.
If the sponsor retains or copies a voter’s personal information, that would be a third-degree felony.

Additonally, the bill says state government (or any person acting on behalf of the state government) may not expend or authorize the expenditure of, and a person or group may not accept public funds for, a political advertisement or any other communication regarding a proposed constitutional amendment.
This was an amendment introduced earlier in the process by Northeast Florida Republican Sen. Jennifer Bradley in response to criticism regarding Gov. DeSantis’ use of such taxpayer funds in 2024.
Lots of opposition
Debate and public comment took more than two hours, with plenty of people speaking out in opposition.
“Citizen-led amendments empower everyday citizens to pass policies that improve our lives and strengthen our communities,” said Kara Gross, legislative director and senior policy counsel of the ACLU of Florida. “This bill takes that power away from the people and solidifies it into the hands of politicians.”
“This bill doesn’t protect democracy, it attacks it,” said Jackson Oberlink, policy director with the progressive group Florida For All. 
“It criminalizes volunteers, imposes outrageous fines, and throws up roadblocks for working class Floridians who want a say in their future. Why? Because when voters lead, they pass policies corporate lobbyists hate, like raising the minimum wage, protecting our environment, and restoring voting rights. This bill isn’t about fraud, it’s about fear. Fear of people power.”
After it passed along party lines, it now moves to the full Senate for consideration. A House companion  filed by Lee County Republican Jenna Persons-Mulicka (HB 1205) has already been approved in that chamber.

Jim Pillen’s latest failed attempt in two years to pressure the Legislature to change the state’s system of awarding electoral votes since the resurgence of a decades-old fight after President Donald Trump and campaign surrogates expressed support for the change during his 2024 campaign, which some pundits thought might come down to the results in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.","Protesters against the winner-take-all change sit in the statehouse balconies on April 8, 2025. (Juan Salinas II II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska Legislature killed a bill seeking to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president after Republicans in the officially nonpartisan body failed to secure enough votes to overcome a four-hour filibuster.
Tuesday was Gov. Jim Pillen’s latest failed attempt in two years to pressure the Legislature to change the state’s system of awarding electoral votes since the resurgence of a decades-old fight after President Donald Trump and campaign surrogates expressed support for the change during his 2024 campaign, which some pundits thought might come down to the results in Nebraska’s Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District.

Pillen’s political future with Trump is unclear after failing to deliver winner-take-all. 
The major Trump donor Pillen beat in the Republican primary for governor, Charles Herbster, is considering challenging Pillen in the 2026 GOP gubernatorial primary. Some in Pillen’s orbit have argued they need to make the electoral change to help keep Trump from potentially endorsing Herbster again. The president backed Herbster in 2022. He was one of the first major Trump-backed candidates nationally to lose a GOP primary.
“I am deeply disappointed that a minority of the Legislature defeated the will of the majority of their colleagues and, more importantly, the majority of Nebraskans by filibustering winner-take-all,” Pillen said in a statement after the vote.
Déjà vu
State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City lacked the 33 votes needed to overcome the filibuster and advance his bill, which echoed what Lippincott told the Nebraska Examiner on Monday — that he didn’t have the votes for LB 3. The measure secured 31 votes for cloture.
“The argument for returning the winner-take-all system isn’t rooted in partisanship. It’s about ensuring that Nebraska’s electoral process aligns with the national framework and guarantees that every vote truly matters,” Lippincott said on the floor, introducing his bill.

Pillen had argued in a post on X Thursday that Republicans, holding 33 of the state’s 49 seats in its one-house Legislature, should be able to come together and pass winner-take-all. 
One of the loudest GOP holdouts was State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston. Trump had called Riepe in 2024, when the then-presidential candidate was trying to convince senators to support Pillen’s 11th-hour push for winner-take-all in a possible special session the governor had discussed calling.
This time, Pillen tried to pressure Riepe in public, calling him out by name in a statement and saying that all Unicameral Republicans need to “stand together as a team.” While the pressure tactic worked on the Government, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee, which advanced the bill to the floor for debate after his push, it did not move Riepe.
“Winner-takes-all is not a 2025 issue. It’s an issue for 2028,” Riepe said.
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb, had also weighed in today with his own statement of support for shifting to winner-take-all on X.
“I urge the Unicameral to let Nebraskaians speak with a united voice by electing a President who will represent our entire state. Passing winner-take-all is long overdue,” Ricketts wrote in his statement. 
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, who voted to advance the bill out of committee, also voted against LB 3.
  State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City. April 8, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
“I committed to keeping an open mind throughout this process and have generally tried to find a way to support this measure,” Wordekemper said. “After careful deliberation, I cannot.”
Others voted along party lines.
A proposed state constitutional amendment that would let the voters decide wasn’t on the agenda but was alluded to during the LB 3 debate. State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams proposed that approach, which the committee also advanced to the floor. The potential fallback proposal likely has no path, either. Riepe is also against it.
Wordekemper of Fremont had expressed interest in letting the voters decide. State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward said during the LB 3 floor debate that she was “a little disappointed” no senator had prioritized Dorn’s amendment.
“How many times has this debate been brought up over the last 25-plus years, Hughes asked. “Why not let the second house vote in 2026 and get it in our Constitution?”
Local political observers are mixed on whether winner-take-all would pass at the ballot box. Some rural Republicans have shared concerns about losing “their voice” one day under winner-take-all as the state becomes more urban and suburban. 
Winner-take-all political theater
The balconies were more filled than usual with protesters against the change. While the political theatre of Tuesday’s debate will make national headlines, the Republican holdouts have been known for months. Lippincott’s bill was known not to have the votes and was considered dead on arrival. Regardless, the governor pressured lawmakers to debate winner-take-all.

State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln said lawmakers have a short session to deal with big issues like the budget, but the governor insists that senators spend time on LB 3 despite knowing the measure lacked the votes to advance.
“So it’s generally feels very problematic for me that this is what we’re wasting our time on,” Dungan told the Nebraska Examiner.

The Nebraska Democratic Party, which has dubbed the 2nd District the “Blue Dot,” called LB 3 and the related constitutional amendment an attempt to “suppress the voices of Nebraskans.” As promised, Democrats and others opposed the change with a filibuster. State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln filed motions to indefinitely postpone, bracket, and send the bill back to committee before Tuesday’s debate. She was one of several senators who spoke at length against the bill.
“Most recent calls to revert to winner take off from U.S. senators, President Trump, and miscellaneous political personalities are both condescending and an admission,” Conrad said on the floor on Tuesday.

State Sen. Megan Hunt of Omaha, a registered nonpartisan who typically sides with progressives, said LB 3 isn’t popular with Nebraskans. She said Nebraskans made their stance on LB 3 clear during its public hearing. 
“It’s about sore losers. It’s about partisanship,” Hunt said.
Nebraska is one of just two states — Maine is the other — that parcel out some electoral votes to the winner of the presidential popular vote in each congressional district. The district approach, adopted in Nebraska in 1991, has led to Democrats claiming a single electoral vote from the 2nd District three times — in 2008, 2020, and 2024. Republicans have won the rest, including two elections each for winning the popular vote for president statewide. 
Recently, a Democratic state lawmaker in Maine proposed a bill that would move Maine back to winner-take-all if Nebraska switches as a way of “protecting” Maine’s voices and voters, which lawmakers mentioned during the debate.

(Amy Dalrymple/North Dakota Monitor)The operator of the Keystone Pipeline that carries oil from Canada into the U.S. has shut the pipeline down after a leak in North Dakota.
South Bow shut down the pipeline at 7:42 a.m. Tuesday after a drop in pressure. The spill was about three miles north of Fort Ransom State Park or six miles south of Kathryn in Barnes County.
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality said it does not yet know how much oil was spilled but that the oil is contained to a farm field south of a pipeline pump station.

Bill Suess with the Division of Water Quality for DEQ said it was not clear how many acres of the field were contaminated.
Suess said the pipeline was shut down within minutes of the pressure dropping.
He said it was unknown how long the pipeline would be shut down.
The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter in that area, Suess said, but did not know how deep it was buried.
The pipeline takes oil from Alberta east to Manitoba and then south through the Midwest, including South Dakota, to the Gulf Coast.
Suess said the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration would be on site Wednesday to investigate. The Department of Environmental Quality will oversee cleanup efforts.

The legislation would allow pregnant women in Medicaid to receive health care coverage for up to 60 days before their formal application for the program. The bill only allows a single period of eligibility for a woman who is pregnant. The legislation also says care received during the presumptive period cannot be retroactively denied.
According to the Legislative Services Agency, the expanded eligibility would increase the obligations of the Alabama Medicaid Agency by an agency-estimated $1 million annually, with $273,700 coming from state funds. 
Alabama has persistently high maternal mortality rates as well as poor infant health outcomes. Pregnant women in the state also have a high number of babies that are born preterm, before 37 weeks gestation.
The bill passed with no discussion. It goes to Gov. Kay Ivey to be signed into law. A message seeking comment from the governor was sent Tuesday afternoon.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)A House committee on Monday recommended several sweeping changes to the North Dakota Ethics Commission’s budget, including cutting a new full-time staff member and adding a new six-month deadline for processing ethics complaints. 
The commission in a Tuesday statement called the changes “a roadblock intended to hamper the commission’s work.”
The House Appropriations Committee’s Education and Environment Division voted to remove funding for an additional full-time Ethics Commission employee narrowly approved by the Senate.
The employee would focus on public education and communications, bringing the total number of Ethics Commission staff to four.
The Ethics Commission was created by a constitutional amendment approved by North Dakota voters in 2018. That amendment mandates that public education be a part of the Ethics Commission’s work.
While the commission already does some educational programming, the commission’s staff have said they believe they should be doing more.
“This role is critical to the Ethics Commission’s role in supporting an open, ethical and accountable government,” Executive Director Rebecca Binstock previously said in testimony to legislators.
Voters created an ethics commission in North Dakota. Then the Legislature limited its power.

Some lawmakers on Monday said they were not convinced.
Rep. Scott Louser, R-Minot, said appropriations should instead focus on finding solutions to help the commission process its growing number of complaints. As of mid-March, the commission had received 59 complaints this year. The commission also has some complaints that are more than two years old.
“I think the bigger issue here is cleaning up some of the timing messes that are taking up all of the time of the commission,” Louser said.
Rep. Karla Rose Hanson, D-Fargo, was the only member of the committee opposed to removing the education staffer. 
Hanson said dedicating an additional employee to education would give the commission’s other staff more time to focus on complaints. She also reasoned that more education would reduce the number of ethics violations the commission must investigate.
The budget set aside about $250,000 for the new staff member. This figure would encompass not only the employee’s two-year salary, but also benefits and other costs.
The committee on Monday also voted 4-3 to remove $50,000 worth of funding for a new case management system for filings with the commission. Commission staff previously testified that the case management system would save them time by helping to automate much of the commission’s recordkeeping.
Rep. Mike Nathe, R-Bismarck, successfully introduced a series of policy changes to the commission’s procedures.
One major change states that each complaint submitted to the commission must be closed within 180 days of its filing. Right now, there is no deadline for processing complaints. 
The Ethics Commission in its Tuesday statement said this aspect of the amendment would “overtly restrict its constitutional investigative power.”
Hanson criticized the proposed deadline as unreasonable, especially in light of the committee voting to remove the education employee and case management funding from the budget.
“They have to move things along in a substantially faster way, but without the tools needed to do that,” Hanson said.
Hanson also said the constitutional amendment that created the Ethics Commission stipulates that the Legislature may not pass laws that “hamper, restrict or impair” what the constitutional amendment requires.
“I guess I’d be concerned that there’s the potential that time limit on when a case has to be closed might be construed as hampering, restricting or impairing,” Hanson said.
The same amendment would give the commission the freedom to dismiss complaints at any time. Commission staff have said that for the most part, the person who submits the complaint wields much of the power over when a complaint may be dismissed. This can leave complaints in limbo for long periods of time.
“I don’t think the amendment ties their hands,” Nathe said of his proposals. “If anything, I think it encourages them to move the cases along, quite frankly, for the benefit of the accused.”
Nathe’s amendment also included legal protections for lawmakers who declare conflicts of interest with legislation.
The amendment would make lawmakers immune from prosecution for voting on legislation they have a conflict of interest with if they adhered to legislative conflict of interest rules or the informal advice of an Ethics Commission staff member.
Under Nathe’s proposal, those accused of ethics violations would be allowed to discuss the allegations against them, as well. Current confidentiality requirements forbid this.
Some parts of Nathe’s amendment resurrect policy changes proposed in House Bill 1360, a bill supported by the Ethics Commission that failed in the House. In that bill, the commission sought greater authority over its complaint process and changes to the confidentiality restrictions for those accused of violations.
The amendment also revives elements of a bill sponsored by House Majority Leader Mike Lefor and Senate Majority Leader David Hogue that sought similar protections for lawmakers. Like House Bill 1360, House Bill 1505 included language allowing people accused of violations to discuss complaints against them but did not survive the House.
Hanson on Monday proposed several other amendments, including one recommended by Sen. Tim Mathern, D-Fargo to add five new full time employees to the commission’s staff. Mathern testified the additional staff members are necessary in order to ensure the Ethics Commission can operate effectively.
Democratic ND senator proposes doubling Ethics Commission budget, citing Holmberg case

Hanson also proposed budgeting an additional $150,000 in funding for the commission to hire outside professional services.
The commission’s base budget for professional fees is $70,000. The Senate added $50,000 to this pot of money, bringing the total to $120,000. Hanson sought to increase this to $270,000.
“If we are not going to increase the staff for the Ethics Commission, then we need to enable them to hire third party attorneys or other professional staff to assist them in addressing this backlog,” Hanson said.
Her proposals to give the Ethics Commission more resources did not advance in committee.
She successfully brought an amendment to require the commission to prepare an annual report detailing its activities.
“I thought that an annual report might help provide some transparency, not only for us as decision makers but for the public overall,” Hanson said.
The bill is expected to be discussed Wednesday in House Appropriations.
Also this week, the Senate voted 46-1 in favor of a bill that would require North Dakota officials to file financial disclosure forms annually, rather than only when they are appointed or file to run for office. House Bill 1469 also requires the secretary of state to publish the forms online. The bill was previously approved by the House. The bill was amended in the Senate and returns to the House for consideration.

(Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)An Iowa ag company accused of operating a billion-dollar check-kiting scheme is being sued by a lender that says 110,000 piglets are at risk of starvation.
Compeer Financial of Minnesota is suing Sunterra Farms Iowa Inc., Sunwold Farms Inc., and Lariagra Farms South Inc. in U.S. District Court. Compeer alleges that the three defendants operate extensive swine operations in Iowa and South Dakota, and have granted Compeer, their lender, exclusive security over their collective assets.
Compeer is asking the court to appoint a receiver to take control of the defendants’ assets so that Compeer can protect its collateral by continuing to provide for the feeding and care of 110,000 head of swine.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The defendant companies are allegedly operated by the Price family of South Dakota, including Ray, Art and Glen Price, who own and manage 110,000 head of swine in 54 barns located in and around Yankton County, South Dakota. The swine — which are in various stages of growth and are owned by either Sunterra or Lariagra — are among 500,000 hogs managed by Sunterra.
Compeer claims in the lawsuit that because of what it calls “the long-running fraud” perpetrated by the defendant companies, they cannot be trusted to operate their businesses and protect their assets, including the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County.
According to the lawsuit, the three defendant companies have engaged in check kiting — a fraudulent practice in which a company draws checks from one bank account for deposit in another bank account that it controls, when neither account has sufficient funds to cover the checks. The process takes advantage of the delays in processing checks between banks, allowing one account or another to continually show credits for funds that have yet to be collected.
Compeer’s lawsuit claims that earlier this year, the defendant companies were issuing each other numerous checks, in nearly identical amounts, on a daily basis — with some checks ranging from $800,000 to $990,000, an amount just below the threshold that would trigger scrutiny from regulators.
The transactions had the effect of creating phony positive account balances that caused Compeer to pay the companies interest, the lawsuit claims.
Compeer alleges that on Feb. 12, 2025, the day after it asked Ray Price, the CEO of the defendant companies, about the transactions, it received a batch of checks totaling $9 million drawn one of the defendants’ Canadian bank accounts for deposit into the defendants’ account with Compeer.
Later that day, the lawsuit claims, Ray Price admitted that the checks were intended only to prevent the Compeer account from being overdrawn, and acknowledged that if Compeer attempted to deposit the $9 million it would trigger a corresponding overdraft in the Canadian account. According to the lawsuit, Price admitted that what the companies were doing was “wrong.”
About 24 hours later, the lawsuit claims, Price spoke to Compeer personnel and said the Canadian account was overdrawn by roughly $21 million, adding that he needed Compeer to immediately “send the money back” to the Canadian bank to cover the overdraft. Compeer refused.
In late February, the lawsuit alleges, Compeer learned the Canadian bank had rejected 65 checks totaling $59.9 million previously credited by Compeer to the defendants’ accounts. As a result, the defendants’ $21 million positive cash balance at Compeer was instantly wiped out and replaced with a $36 million debt owed by the defendants to Compeer.
In its lawsuit, Compeer alleges that before the check-kiting scheme collapsed, it involved “billions of dollars” in fraudulent transactions.
Court records show that on March 17, 2025, the Canadian bank asked that a receiver be appointed to look after the defendants’ assets. However, the listed assets in that case didn’t include the 110,000 head of swine in Yankton County, or the 370,000 head owned by third parties and managed by Sunterra.
In court filings, Compeer says that over the past several weeks, it has provided funds necessary for the care and feeding of the Yankton County pigs, but says it is no longer willing to do so “while the parties who perpetrated this fraudulent scheme” remain in control of Sunterra, Sunwold and Lariagra.
“These swine are in imminent danger of starvation if feed is not promptly purchased and delivered to barns housing the pigs,” the lawsuit states, adding that workers hired to provide for the animals’ care may soon walk off the job given the Price family’s inability to make payroll.
If court appoints a receiver, Compeer states in its court filings, it will advance the money necessary to protect its collateral and prevent the animals’ starvation.
The Price family has not yet responded to the lawsuit and Sunserra declined comment. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for fraud and unjust enrichment. The lawsuit was initially filed in South Dakota state court before being transferred to federal court.

Control and Prevention)Over objections by the Florida Dental Association and League of Women Voters of Florida, a Senate panel voted Tuesday to bar public water systems from “the use of any additive included primarily for health-related purposes.”
The ban is included in an omnibus Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services bill (SB 700) that now heads to the full Senate for consideration.
The bill was praised by Pensacola resident Pueschel Schneier, the first to testify on the bill during public debate.
She said the decision to add fluoride to water may have been valid in the 1940s, before people knew about tooth decay and cavities and proper oral health. 
“But times have changed. Eighty years later, America is the land of plenty. There is no excuse for someone who claims they don’t have access to a toothbrush. It boils down to personal accountability. People are responsible for making sure their children are brushing their teeth correctly and that they’re eating the proper diet,” Schneier said.  
She did add, “I’m sure genetics play a huge role.”
The Florida Dental Association opposes the bill but did not publicly testify against it in committee Tuesday.
League of Women Voters Co-President Cecile M. Scoon said her organization opposes the bill because it preempts local governments from deciding whether to add fluoride to water. The organization generally has opposed legislation curbing local government from making decisions locally.
Moreover, Coon took aim at Schneier’s testimony that proper health habits are ingrained in every child.
“There have been studies that have shown that despite the first speaker, not every parent is doing everything the right way. I mean, obviously, children come with all kinds of problems that we would not want to see and sometimes it’s nutrition, it’s their immunizations, different things. “
A movement?
The bill passed the committee as Seminole County leaders voted Tuesday to stop adding fluoride to its water supply. That followed the Miami Dade County commission’s decision a week ago to do the same.
Utah became the first state to stop adding fluoride to its water supply. The decision was praised by Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention named community fluoridation of drinking water one of the 10 great public health interventions of the 20th Century because of the dramatic decline in cavities since it started in 1945. 
There is no government mandate, though, for community fluoridation of drinking water. The U.S. Public Health Service recommends fluoride levels for municipalities that do choose to add fluoride to community water supplies.
Florida Surgeon General Joseph Ladapo recommended against community fluoridation late last year.
Ladapo, whose past advice on health issues has roundly been criticized by others in the healthcare arena, saw his suggestion rejected by the group that represents Florida dentists, which countered that fluoridation is one of the “most effective and affordable public health measures” around.
Ladapo asserted a “neuropsychiatric risk associated with fluoride exposure,” citing studies that allege exposure to fluoride increases risk of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and lower IQs.
“It is clear more research is necessary to address safety and efficacy concerns regarding community water fluoridation,” Ladapo, who works for Gov. Ron DeSantis, said in a written statement. “The previously considered benefit of community water fluoridation does not outweigh the current known risks, especially for special populations like pregnant women and children.”

Senate File 491 was amended on the House floor Tuesday to remove language classifying a “farmstead” as “40 or more contiguous acres.” 
The bill builds on a 2024-enacted law that prohibited drones from flying over animal feeding operations and homesteads and created misdemeanor fines up to $2,560 if the drone that flew over these areas was equipped with recording devices. 
The proposed legislation, which advanced from the Senate March 17, would prohibit the use of a drone, without the landowner’s permission, within 400 feet of farm animals, equipment and structures, including animal feeding operations, farmer residences, barns and manure storage.
Rep. Derek Wulf, R-Hudson, said the bill “broadens the scope” of the existing law and “strengthens” security.  
“It protects our livestock and agriculture producers more strongly than the law we passed last year,” Wulf said. 
Proponents of the bill said livestock are afraid of the remote aircraft and that it invades a farmer’s privacy. 
Opponents of the bill argue it, and the existing law, would be preempted by federal laws that regulate airspace. 
A fact sheet on the local regulation of Unmanned Aircraft Systems from the Federal Aviation Administration, explains that some privacy-related restrictions on drones, if it interferes with the administration’s ability to “safely and effectively integrate UAS into the national airspace” would be preempted. 
According to the document, at least 44 states have enacted laws pertaining to unmanned aircraft systems since 2013 and the FAA holds that states are “generally free to regulate” as long as the laws do not interfere with federal regulations or “relate to the prices, routes, or services of commercial air carriers.”

Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, photographed on April 5 at Nashville's Pearl-Cohn High School.(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Joining the ranks of prominent national Democrats parachuting into red parts of the country for town-hall-style pep rallies, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren popped into town last weekend to headline a buck-up-the-blue gig at Nashville’s Pearl-Cohn High School gym.  A crowd of 1,500 or so despairing Democrats were on hand to receive a collective transfusion of progressive gusto delivered by a skilled celebrity political phlebotomist. 
Actually, the despair was already in temporary remission even before Warren took the stage, given the timing — many ventured on over to Pearl-Cohn already jazzed by the anti-everything-Trump “Hands Off” rally in Centennial Park earlier that afternoon. Judging by the enthusiasm in the gym it’s fair to assume most thought Warren’s amped-up harangue on the horrors of Trump 2.0 delivered the goods, juicing some optimism that Democrats can navigate a path out of the wilderness. 
I didn’t come away sharing that optimism. I was more than happy to spend part of an afternoon in the company of fellow political travelers thirsty for compelling evidence that an organized opposition lives and breathes, and for a jolt of bullishness about the ability of that opposition to rescue the American experiment. It was good of Warren to give over her Saturday to flying down to the provinces to spend an hour rallying the righteous, but once she was done shouting at us I felt no more sanguine that the national party has come to grips with its own debilities than when she began – and perhaps even less so.
Here are the things that troubled me about Warren’s appearance.
For starters, while the topical arc of her remarks was wide, the depth was shallow and connections to present political realities were thin. It came off largely as a rote restatement of what the Democratic party stands for on issues of economic inequality, health care, education, corruption, and climate change. It was a litany of problems framed in familiar (read: stale) ways without concrete solutions that are attainable in the present political environment. 
  Elizabeth Warren’s appearance and speech in Nashville failed to address issues plaguing the Democratic Party, including generational tensions. (Photo: John Partipilo)
When Warren did connect some dots to current Trump administration mayhem, the lines drawn felt simplistic. She threaded her comments with a vapidly recurring call-and-response gambit: Will cutting the Department of Education put more money in your pocket? “No!” Will shearing veteran’s benefits put more money in your pocket? “No!”And she kept tediously circling back to her enduring bête noire, billionaires. 
There are a few problems here. For one thing, while the slapdash DOGEcropping of federal bureaucracy may be feckless and pernicious, the motivation behind it is politically popular, and a good deal of it ultimately involves rearranging deck chairs, not throwing them overboard. So it is simplistic to frame these issues in all-or-nothing terms. Also, the conceit behind Warren’s call-and-response is technically flawed. Actual cuts to actual federal programs (however bad an idea any particular cut may be) actually could put money in voter pockets if funneled into tax cuts. If you called out those questions in front of an audience of moderates and non-MAGA Republicans you might well get a different response, and it wouldn’t be an insane one. And her billionaire obsession is a distraction. The craven fealty of many of them to Trump may be grotesque, but over the long-haul Democrats have been just as complicit as Republicans in the financialization of American democracy. 
I was especially troubled by all the things that Warren didn’t talk about. No discussion of immigration and culture-war issues that tanked Joe Biden’s and the party’s popularity over the last two years. No mention of party leadership’s complicity in propping up Biden and preempting a nomination contest. And no mention of the urgent generational tensions happening right now in her party—a particularly noxious omission when the speaker is a 75-year-old third-term senator and a member in good standing of the geriatric caucus that many wish to see urgently disrupted. 
And let me pile on with two quibbles. 
Quibble 1: I faulted Warren above for lacking depth, but beyond that I found aspects of her remarks to border on infantilizing. She spent time and breath explaining some of the biggest issues of the day in the simplest of terms. This was an activist audience turning out to hear an out-of-state senator on a Saturday afternoon. Everyone in the room knew coming in what’s bugging them about the current state of affairs, and didn’t need a remedial lesson. It’s as if in deciding to fly down she thought to herself “OK, I’m heading to ignoramus-laden Tennessee so I’ll need to dial down the rhetoric to hayseed.” 



				Sen. Elizabeth Warren played to the activist crowd but didn’t discuss Democratic failures like the culture-war issues that tanked Joe Biden’s popularity over the last two years, nor party leadership’s complicity in preempting a nomination contest. 			


Quibble 2: The Warren appearance was explicitly billed as a town hall, but a town hall is an audience-question-driven conversation, not stump-speech bloviation followed by a quick handful of softball questions and cue the selfie line. In more ordinary political times I might write this off as just a bit of trifling event misbranding. But at this turbulent moment with blue America begging its hemorrhaging party to take consequential steps to get right with itself and its voters, perhaps the party might want to listen more and talk less, and be candid about that.
Is all of this too strident a critique for an event that was mainly fashioned as a get-off-the-mat pep rally? Are my expectations excessive? 
I get it that these red-state road shows are intended to get Dems out there in places where they might not be expected to show up, highlight party contrasts, tap into pent-up energy among the faithful, and maybe get some press coverage along the way. Plus when thousands answer a party text or email to say yes I’ll come to a high school gym to hear Elizabeth Warren, as happened here, that’s a nontrivial political organizing gambit. 
But I’m cranky about Warren’s appearance because a political celebrity pop-in that elevates shopworn talking-point speechifying over an actual thoughtful conversation about the real problems the party faces is an occasion quickly forgotten, and rightly so. An amped up crowd filed into Pearl-Cohn’s gym eager for insight into how their party is going to turn itself around, and filed out a couple of hours later with no better grasp of it than when they arrived. That’s what I call a missed opportunity.

McFadden wrote that the news outlet is likely to succeed on its First Amendment and retaliation arguments in further court proceedings, and that the White House’s action has caused irreparable harm to the news agency.The legal battle tests decades of established press access for the AP in the White House, which was curtailed after President Donald Trump declared the term “Gulf of America” should be used rather than “Gulf of Mexico.”The injunction orders the White House to immediately rescind the denial of AP’s access to the Oval Office, Air Force One and “other limited spaces based on the AP’s viewpoint when such spaces are made open to other members of the White House press pool.”The order also states the administration’s press team “shall immediately rescind their viewpoint-based denial of the AP’s access to events open to all credentialed White House journalists.”The mandate will remain in place while the case is carried out at the district court level, though the White House is likely to appeal the case.In his 41-page order, McFadden, appointed by Trump in his first term in office, stated the analysis of the AP’s arguments is “straightforward” and that ramifications for the organization have “undoubtedly been adverse.”“The AP made an editorial decision to continue using ‘Gulf of Mexico’ in its Stylebook. The Government responded publicly with displeasure and explicitly announced it was curtailing the AP’s access to the Oval Office, press pool events, and East Room activities. If there is a benign explanation for the Government’s decision, it has not been presented here,” McFadden wrote.The AP and the Trump administration presented evidence to McFadden during a March 27 hearing.The judge contends in his order that the AP clearly showed that its print reporters “have been systematically and almost completely excluded from events open to the broader White House press corps since February 13, while its photographers have suffered curtailed access.”“The Government declined to offer witnesses in rebuttal. The Court credits the detailed timeline that the AP built through testimony and evidence,” he wrote.The White House did not immediately respond for comment.Trump and administration officials also did not immediately react on social media.",,,,2025-04-08 18:08:43.580884

(Photo by Claire Sullivan/New Hampshire Bulletin)A company that has spent years trying to build a landfill near a lake in a northern New Hampshire town is taking a recent permit denial to court.
Granite State Landfill LLC, a subsidiary of the Vermont-based Casella Waste Systems, filed a legal complaint in Merrimack County Superior Court Tuesday against the state’s Department of Environmental Services, arguing the administrative rule that the agency used to deny its application “violates the constitutional separation of powers by usurping legislative authority.”
Last week, DES denied the company’s solid waste permit application for the proposed landfill in Dalton, which has drawn years of opposition over its close proximity to Forest Lake and fears about negative public health and environmental impacts. The agency said the application had become dormant and was therefore denied under its rules. While the solid waste permit is one of several sought by the company, the project cannot move forward without it.
In Tuesday’s legal complaint, the company argued that that dormancy rule is beyond the scope of the department’s legal authority, making its denial of the permit application on that basis “unlawful.” GSL is asking the court to declare that the rule is void for that reason and, consequently, the denial. The company also said it would seek an appeal of the denial through the state’s Waste Management Council.
Jim Martin, a public information officer for the department, said DES “cannot comment on ongoing litigation.”
This latest chapter comes at a new height of political opposition against the landfill. In her inaugural address, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte vowed she would not allow the project to go forward and endorsed a one-year pause on all new landfills in the state, a stark change in tone and policy from her predecessor Chris Sununu. In the Legislature, a host of bills aim to address various waste issues in New Hampshire, including strengthening siting requirements that critics say are far too relaxed.
Jeff Weld, Casella’s vice president of communications, said the company was “confident” its petition for declaratory judgment would be successful, and that “the development of the Granite State Landfill will remain on track.” He defended the project as creating needed additional disposal capacity, something opponents have argued the state won’t need for years.
“It is unfortunate that despite providing thousands of pages of documents over the course of two years and nearly a dozen separate supplemental submissions in response to requests from NHDES, that they chose to deny the permit application based on dormancy,” Weld said. “The ongoing submissions, conversations, and work being conducted in support of the permit application supports our claim in the petition that there is no way for the application to be considered ‘dormant’ within any ordinary meaning of that word.”
His statement echoes a point made in the legal filing; while the company argues that dormancy is not a legitimate reason for the department to deny its permit application, it also argues that the permit could in “no way” be considered dormant “within the ordinary meaning of that word.”
The company said it has submitted “approximately 4,000 pages of documents and plans” to the department, that it has made “ten substantial submissions” since the application was filed in October 2023, and that “most of GSL’s submissions were in response to additional information sought by NHDES in letters finding the application ‘incomplete.’”
Amy Manzelli, an attorney with BCM Environmental & Land Law who represents the North Country Alliance for Balanced Change, a citizen group opposed to the landfill, said GSL and its parent company, Casella, “sometimes fall into this trap of mistaking quantity for quality.”
“The complaint goes on at length about how much quantity of application material GSL submitted, but that doesn’t necessarily mean they met the required quality of information that they needed to provide,” Manzelli said, “and I think they just missed the mark on that.”
She said she doesn’t think the company has a “winning argument.”
“There’s a clear statutory authorization to the Department of Environmental Services to make rules about denying permit applications, and so the department went ahead and did that,” Manzelli said.
In its permit denial last week, the department told the company that a permit application becomes dormant when the applicant fails to submit required information requested by the department within a year of first being notified that the application is incomplete, a date that came in February for Casella. A dormant, incomplete application “shall be deemed denied without further action by the department,” said Michael Wimsatt, director of DES’ waste management division, in a letter to the company.
Wimsatt said the application remained incomplete for a number of reasons, like not including a “site report that demonstrates that the location of the proposed facility complies with all applicable siting requirements and that the site is a suitable location for the proposed facility….” Additionally, “the maps, figures, and hydrogeological report” submitted by the applicant in 2023 had not been updated to show compliance with the state’s regulations that were updated in December, Wimsatt said.
Wimsatt also said that legal agreements submitted by the company “failed to fulfill application requirements because they were heavily redacted and referenced other legal agreements, which were not provided.”
The company asserts in its legal complaint that it “provided all the necessary information to complete the Application by February 27, 2025, at the latest.” It also argued the department was “not entitled to the entirety of the agreement between GSL and the landowner, where the redacted terms have no bearing on whether GSL will have the requisite ownership interest.” It also pointed to the fact that the updated rules were not in effect at the time its application was determined to be incomplete.
Adam Finkel, a Dalton resident and former federal regulator who opposes the project, has also frequently been critical of the department. He pointed to those critiques in outlining his doubts about Casella’s legal argument.
“My real beef with DES and with the Legislature is that the statutes give them (the department) too much authority. … Like (RSA) 149-M says, ‘Go ahead and make rules in the following 11 areas,’” Finkel said. “So there’s almost nothing they’re not allowed to do. So I was actually kind of amazed that Casella’s now saying, you know, ‘You don’t have authority to do this,’ because the statutes are so open ended.”
He urged the Senate, which has traditionally been a hurdle to landfill legislation, to approve a moratorium, bolster siting requirements, and greenlight other bills aimed at strengthening the state’s waste policy.
“The Senate has no excuse now but to pass these bills, because we’re under siege from a company that won’t go away,” Finkel said.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_7518-1-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-08 18:08:43.580884

SB 252, sponsored by Sen. Bill Beasley, D-Clayton, and called the “Community Pharmacy Relief Act,” seeks to address concerns from independent pharmacies over reimbursement rates and business practices that critics say have driven many out of business.
PBMs act as a “middle-man” between health insurers, pharmacies and drug manufacturers. They negotiate drug prices, determine reimbursement rates for pharmacies and manage prescription drug benefits.

Critics accuse PBMs of using their position to impose unfair fees and steer patients toward PBM-owned pharmacies. PBMs are also accused of keeping manufacturer rebates for themselves instead of passing the savings along to consumers.
Rep. Phillip Rigsby, R-Huntsville, an independent pharmacy owner who carried the legislation in the House, said after the bill passed that the process was hard, but that he knew he needed to continue on for the local pharmacies across the state.
“There have been many ups and downs in this journey, and there were days I wanted to throw in the towel, but I realized that my flesh was telling me to quit,” Rigsby said. “Thanks be to God. When I felt defeated, that’s when my faith reminded me.”
Rep. Mark Gidley, R-Hokes Bluff, said the legislation is very important for family-owned pharmacies across the state. According to ABC33/40, 300 of Alabama’s 800 independent pharmacies have closed across the state in the last six years.
“We have pharmacies that are closing all across the state. My understanding is about 10 since the first of the year,” Gidley said. “The loss of local pharmacies is a terrible detriment to the health care of our people, especially in the rural areas. This can’t happen.”
The bill would impose new restrictions on PBMs, including a prohibition on reimbursing independent pharmacies at rates lower than those paid by the Alabama Medicaid Agency. It would also ban PBMs from charging certain fees to pharmacies, require them to pass on 100% of manufacturer rebates to health plans and prevent them from blocking pharmacists from disclosing lower-cost alternatives to patients.
The House unanimously passed an amendment from Rep. Joe Lovvorn, R-Auburn, that would allow pharmacies to negotiate with the PBMs to keep a part of rebates used for administrative reasons. 
“If I’m a private business and have the right to negotiate with a PBM, that if I want to take part of those rebates from those drugs that are offered, I can either receive those rebates or I can negotiate to be part of the administrative fee,” Lovvorn said. 
The bill goes to the Senate for concurrence or a conference committee.

(Nathaniel Bailey for the Daily Montanan)A week of new tariffs from President Donald Trump has shocked the markets and left at least some Montanans wondering about their investments.
And the Trump administration’s budget cuts have left some legislators wondering about the state’s budget bill, entering the final stages of discussion during the waning days of the 2025 Legislature.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average has dropped almost 4,200 points (about 10%) during the last month, while the Nasdaq Composite is down almost 2,200 points (12.3%) during the same period. 
The Trump Administration’s stated goal with tariffs has been to boost American manufacturing, although economists have disagreed on the effects the tariffs would have.
A White House fact sheet explaining the tariffs stated, “increasing domestic manufacturing is critical to U.S. national security.” The administration has also said there is both a trade imbalance and tariffs that are “unfair” to America.
Senate Majority Leader Sen. Tom McGillvary said on Tuesday it was a little early to be making broad declarations about the tariffs’ effects. McGillvary was a financial advisor for Ameriprise Financial for 27 years and has seen volatility before.
“Things go up, things go down, markets react … I just don’t think you can make a call in one week,” said McGillvary, R-Billings. 
He said the more notable issue is what federal cuts will do and how the state will have to react to that.
The Department of Public Health and Human Services could be impacted, which could in turn force the Legislature to react. About 90% of funding for Medicaid expansion is coming from the federal government. 
It could involve a special session, said Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, but he said there’s no crystal ball to know the full effects to Montana. 
“But I don’t think a special session should be a scary word at all,” Reiger said.
Democrats have taken a different line, with House Minority Leader Katie Sullivan, D-Missoula, saying she was “very concerned” about economic instability and hits to state services.
It’s also something constituents are concerned about, she added, and federal cuts have also played a part in that fear.
“I have people just saying they’re very worried the economy is going to tank, and we’ll have a recession, and we will come back to the Montana Legislature and cut the heck out of all the human services,” Sullivan said. 
  Rapidly developing 

Federal cuts were part of the discussion Tuesday in the Senate Finance and Claims Committee as senators held a hearing on the big budget bill, House Bill 2.
Sen. Janet Ellis, D-Helena, wanted to know what mechanisms the governor’s budget office might have in place should smaller agencies lose a significant amount of funding.
Federal dollars account for roughly half of the spending in HB 2.
Amy Sassano, deputy budget director from the governor’s budget office, said the Legislature would likely see a proposal in the next week or so about how it plans to respond. She declined to share details at the meeting.
However, Sassano said the interest from the governor’s budget office is to respond in “an enterprise-wide and thoughtful way,” and not react to changes one at a time.
“Our office doesn’t think that we can look at one agency in isolation,” Sassano said.
Sen. Emma Kerr-Carpenter, D-Billings, asked Sassano if the language in HB 2 addressing the possibility of a hit on revenues based on federal cuts was sensitive enough to the situation.
HB 2 includes a provision for additional Legislative Finance Committee meetings and other budget meetings should specific drops occur, such as legislation or an executive order that reduces anticipated federal revenue by more than $100 million.
Sassano said the language sounded reasonable. However, she also said secretaries of federal departments still have a lot of work to do, and at times, dollars that are believed to be frozen end up released.
Sassano also said that if Montana starts seeing “significant revenues being lost,” the state does not have the capacity to backfill every federal dollar lost.
Some state officials talked about cuts they fear are imminent, and at least one legislator talked about the difficulty of weighing important budget decisions in the midst of uncertainty.
Montana State Librarian Jennie Stapp said federal funding accounts for roughly 20% of the state library’s budget and slightly more than 20% of its budget for employees.
“We are very, very concerned about the status of the federal funds that we rely on,” Stapp said, pointing to cuts in other states. 
Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula, said legislators were struggling to evaluate the budget in “real time” given potential changes from the federal government.
She pointed to a $10 million request for a new shooting range for law enforcement, as well as critical safety net programs in the Department of Public Health and Human Services, as expenses to be weighed.
Boldman said policy decisions that might have seemed responsible a few weeks ago might seem different now.
Rebecca DeCamara, with the health department, said the state is getting some “mixed messages” about block grants, used to fund a lot of the substance abuse programs and behavioral health programs that aren’t funded by Medicaid.
DeCamara said legal action has led to a halt on the cessation of some funds, although a final result “remains to be seen.” She also said the agency is making plans to ensure it can reimburse contracts that are already obligated.
“We’re really in a wait-and-see moment right now,” DeCamara said.
Charlie Brereton, director of the health department, said the only certain funding cuts his agency has been alerted to by the feds are Covid-related sources, and it aims to look for ways to replace them with excess appropriations in other areas.
“What we’re doing is trying to find opportunities to mitigate those funding cuts wherever possible,” Brereton said.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250212_MTLeg-275-scaled-e1742494034339-1024x836.jpg,,,2025-04-08 18:08:43.580884

(Photo courtesy of Last Energy)Louisiana is joining a lawsuit to overturn a federal rule as the state looks to roll back regulations on small nuclear reactors. 
Gov. Jeff Landry and the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality (LDEQ) announced Tuesday the state will join Texas, Utah and energy company Last Energy in challenging the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s “utilization facility rule,” a licensing requirement that applies uniformly to all nuclear reactors, regardless of size or risk profile.
Landry said the state is amenable to the development of small modular reactors, or SMRs, with a capacity to produce up to 300 megawatts of electricity. By comparison, Entergy’s Grand Gulf Nuclear Station in Port Gibson, Mississippi, which provides part of the utility’s power, has more than 1,400 MW of generation capability  
“Joining this lawsuit is about defending our ability to pursue advanced energy solutions like SMRs — solutions that are reliable, clean and essential for economic development in the State,” Landry said in a LDEQ news release.
The governor, Attorney General Liz Murrill and LDEQ secretary Aurelia Giacometto said in the release that, with a favorable outcome in the lawsuit, Louisiana could be uniquely poised to benefit from adding SMRs. At a separate news conference Tuesday morning, Landry noted the state already gets its electricity from a variety of sources, including natural gas-powered plants, coal-fired plants, hydroelectric facilities and nuclear power plants.
“The state of Louisiana has always been living in ‘all-of-the-above’ for over 50 years,” the governor said. 
Originally filed in Texas in December, the federal lawsuit claims the Nuclear Regulatory Commission rule has overextended its authority to regulate small modular reactors under the utilization facility rule. The lawsuit claims SMRs typically carry a lower safety and financial risk profile than larger reactors because of the “insignificant” amount of nuclear material it uses, making it unreasonable to apply the same regulations. 
“Members of the public would be exposed to only insignificant amounts of nuclear radiation, even in the case of a meltdown,” the lawsuit reads. 
The lawsuit seeks to make it easier for Last Energy, a commercial nuclear reactor manufacturer with headquarters in Washington, D.C., to expand the use of its small modular reactors. The power source option is growing increasingly relevant as the military and data centers across the country look for large amounts of reliable energy to power their operations. 
Nuclear development in the United States has substantially slowed since the 1980s, though nuclear plants account for nearly 20% of U.S. electricity generation overall and about 55% of U.S. carbon‐free electricity, according to the World Nuclear Association. 
“We are ready to take the next step and lead in the deployment and oversight of SMRs,” said Giacometto in the release. “If this challenge succeeds, states not participating in the case may remain under outdated rules, while Louisiana would be free to lead.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)MITCHELL — Taneeza Islam’s nonprofit organization represents unaccompanied children as young as 5 years old in immigration court.
In March, she learned that the federal government canceled the anti-human-trafficking grant that pays groups like hers to represent kids facing deportation. Her organization, South Dakota Voices for Peace, lost about $325,000. 
Islam intends to keep working with the underage clients that Voices for Peace has now, but the loss of grant funding across a nationwide network of nonprofits means fewer clients will have representation.
“Now children have to show up in court without a lawyer and defend themselves,” Islam said Monday evening during a Dakota Wesleyan University McGovern Center forum on immigration.
Since the start of the second Trump administration, she said, the U.S. has lost its way on immigration enforcement. Instead of prioritizing those with criminal records, lslam said it feels like every undocumented person is now a target.

“When there are policies that target children, to me that is a moral issue.” 
Islam was one of four panelists at the forum. The others were Ben Ready, the southeast region director for U.S. Senate Majority Leader John Thune; Mary Hogan, a community relations officer for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE); and John Hakari, a former immigration attorney who’s now a professor at Dakota Wesleyan.
The morality of the Trump administration’s enforcement priorities dominated the public commentary portion of the forum.
Some referenced other immigration actions they found shocking. Two talked about a video of a Tufts University postdoctoral student apprehended by ICE officers late last month.
One referenced a recent video of former South Dakota governor and now-Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem standing outside a holding cell filled with shirtless, deported Venezuelans held in an El Salvador prison. The audience member compared ICE officers to Gestapo officers in Nazi Germany.
Hogan, however, in both her prepared remarks and in her responses to those inquiries, urged the audience to separate their feelings on enforcement actions from their feelings about the officers carrying them out.
The Nazi comparisons are baseless, she said. Hitler’s Germany wrote laws to target Jews and enforced them brutally. 
ICE officers in the U.S., Hogan said, enforce laws “that have been on the books for decades” as part of an immigration system whose gears turn at different speeds from administration to administration.
“While the tempo of what we’re doing is probably more increased than the last administration, the laws are not different,” Hogan said. 
The immigration actions now drawing criticism reflect the preference of the American people, according to Ready, the regional director for Sen. Thune.
“When President Trump ran for office, he talked a lot about a very specific immigration policy,” Ready said. “And he won.”
Thune’s office in Sioux Falls has a staff member who does nothing but field immigration inquiries from constituents and people seeking help understanding the system. 
Thune’s position on immigration reform has two planks, Ready said: “a big wall” to protect the southern border and “a big gate” for legal immigration.
In Congress, he said, any reform proposal without a wall to appease conservatives “is dead.” The same would be true, he said, for any compromise without a path to citizenship — a must for Democrats.
It’s unfortunate, Ready said, that those who want real reform face the same roadblocks year after year.
“Everyone seems to have dug in their heels even more,” he said.

Immigration is one of the most complex areas of the law, according to Hakari, the former immigration attorney, and one that hasn’t seen significant reform since the Ronald Reagan administration offered amnesty to around 3 million undocumented people.
The paths to legal status are narrow, and he said “it breaks my heart” when people with the right to it miss their chance to stay because they misunderstood the law or made a minor misstep.
He suggested bringing back a provision in immigration law that allows a person whose only infraction is overstaying a visa a chance to pay a fine and gain entry. 
Bring back that provision, he suggested, then, “jack up the fine, and use the fine to pay for the wall.”
Like Hogan, he said the officers and lawyers in the system don’t bear the responsibility for the legal framework under which they operate, or for how they’re expected to apply the law. As an attorney, he said, he saw how a change in presidential administration would lead to a change in his interactions with ICE lawyers. The same lawyers who may have agreed to deadline extensions under one president would hold firm on deadlines under another.
He encouraged those concerned about the current administration’s approach to donate to organizations like Islam’s.
“If a 5-year-old kid is removable by ICE, it’s their job to attempt to remove them,” Hakari said. “You can debate about whether that makes them the good guy or a bad guy. The good guy, definitely, though, is the person who sits at the table in immigration court with the 5-year-old.”
After the forum, Islam told South Dakota Searchlight that her group has “an ethical obligation” to continue to represent the 60 underage clients it has, in spite of the March 21 cancellation of the legal aid grant.
She and others affiliated with the umbrella grantee, Acacia Legal Services, have gotten mixed messages about whether the grant money could return.
The five-year grant was authorized by Congress, and the fourth year’s awards were meant to be released at the end of March, just days after the cancellation.
In the absence of certainty, Islam said, “I’m operating as though we won’t have that.”

Shae Sortwell [&#8230;]","Robert F. Kennedy Jr. gives remarks at the Renaissance Phoenix Downtown Hotel on Aug. 23, 2024 in Phoenix, Arizona. (Photo by Rebecca Noble/Getty Images)The Wisconsin Assembly Committee on Campaigns and Elections held a public hearing Tuesday morning for Republican-authored bills introduced in response to third-party candidates in last year’s election — one who was unable to get on the presidential ballot and the other who wasn’t allowed to get off. 
The first bill, authored by Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers) and Sen. Andre Jacque (R-New Franken), would allow third-party presidential candidates to gain access to Wisconsin’s presidential ballot without their party having any members holding elected office in the state. 
Last year, the Democratic National Committee filed a complaint arguing the Green Party was not eligible to be on the presidential ballot because state law requires presidential electors nominated in October to be chosen by state officers and legislative candidates. 
The statute states that presidential electors must be nominated by each political party’s state officers, holdover state senators and candidates for the state Senate and Assembly. The Democrats argued the Green Party doesn’t have anyone who qualifies, so it couldn’t be on the ballot.
The Wisconsin Supreme Court dismissed the DNC’s lawsuit against the Green Party. Jill Stein, the party’s nominee for president, received 12,275 votes, about 0.4% of the statewide total. 
In his remarks introducing the bill, Sortwell said the effort to exclude the Green Party from the ballot was “an attack upon democracy.” 
“No political candidate should be restricted ballot access and discouraged to run because their respective party has not yet won a political office,” Sortwell said. “It’s rather ludicrous on its face, if you consider that a party is not entitled to a monopoly for ballot access and to certain votes. To make the law clear, this legislation protects political third parties from frivolous lawsuits by allowing the chairperson of the party’s state committee to nominate their presidential electors.”
The other bill heard by the committee Tuesday addresses Robert F. Kennedy’s failed effort to get his name off Wisconsin’s presidential ballot after he had dropped out of the race and endorsed President Donald Trump. 
Kennedy had filed nomination papers with the Wisconsin Elections Commission that included the signatures of enough voters for him to qualify and be placed on the ballot. Before the Wisconsin Elections Commission met on Aug. 27 to make its final certification of candidates, Kennedy dropped out of the race and wrote a letter to the commission asking to take his name off the ballot. 
Under state law, however, candidates who file nomination papers and qualify to run cannot withdraw and must remain on the ballot, unless they die. Kennedy unsuccessfully sued to have his name removed, taking the case all the way from Dane County circuit court to the Wisconsin Supreme Court and the U.S. Supreme Court. 
Once the candidates are certified, county clerks begin printing and mailing absentee ballots, making it much harder to change who is on the ballot. 
Under the bill, authored by Rep. David Steffen (R-Howard), qualified independent candidates for president and vice president, and all qualified candidates for the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives, the state Senate and Assembly, governor and lieutenant governor, secretary of state and state treasurer could remove  their name from the ballot if they file a sworn statement withdrawing their candidacy before the WEC deadline for certifying candidates. 
The bill would also make it a felony offense punishable by up to 10 years imprisonment and a $25,000 fine to file a false statement withdrawing someone’s candidacy for office. 
In his testimony, Steffen said California is the only other state that doesn’t allow candidates off the ballot unless they die and that the policy is “unrealistic and somewhat embarrassing.” 
“So having such a law probably made sense in the 1800s when death was more of a reality, a regular occurrence, but in current times, it seems appropriate that we develop a mechanism, like all the other states, to allow individuals who, if between the time that they submit their paperwork and the election, that they have some sort of opportunity on their own to pull themselves off the ballot,” he said. 
The bill would not apply to candidates for local office. In this year’s spring election, a candidate for Madison Common Council won by a slim margin after dropping out of the race and endorsing her opponent. 
Rock County Clerk Lisa Tollefson testified that her only concern is that Steffen’s proposal could limit clerks’ ability to get ballots out on time. She noted that clerks begin designing, preparing and testing their ballots long before the elections commission certifies the candidates. 
For the clerks, she said, the WEC certification is the go-ahead that ballots can be printed and mailed. She said their work will be slowed down if they need to wait until the last possible moment to begin that preparation work, because a candidate might drop out.
“Those are really tight time frames, and as absentee ballots keep growing in popularity, we have to print more ballots, and printing ballots takes more time, so if we need that extra time, please don’t take any time away from us,” Tollefson said.

Kevin Stitt on Wednesday suggests elimination of the Oklahoma Forestry Service, criticizing its response to historic wildfires that swept across the state last month. His remarks were made during his weekly briefing with reporters in the Blue Room at the Capitol. (Photo by Barbara Hoberock/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A key legislative leader said Tuesday he is pleased that Gov. Kevin Stitt has backed off his call to abolish the Forestry Service following historic March wildfires.
During a Tuesday interview with Oklahoma City television station News 9, the Republican governor said he no longer plans to abolish that state agency tasked with wildland fire detection and preserving the state’s forests. Stitt’s about-face came less than a day after he doubled down on his controversial call to shutter the agency and reallocate the funding to volunteer fire departments.
“It’s encouraging to hear the governor’s shifting position of abolishing the forestry department,” said House Speaker Kyle Hilbert, R-Bristow. “I think Oklahomans said loud and clear that is not a good idea.”
Stitt told the television station Tuesday that he threatened to close the Forestry Service because his administration was not getting answers about the deployment of resources.
“Listen, we are not going to get rid of forestry,” Stitt told the station on Tuesday. “I love our forestry. Those guys are doing what they are told. The bureaucracy at the top, their management let them down by not deploying them accurately.”
He told the TV station Tuesday that he had fired “a couple more people at the top level at forestry because – they were – it was insubordination.”
Stitt said Agriculture Secretary Blayne Arthur could not get answers from administrators in Forestry Services for three weeks.
Stitt’s office did not respond to Oklahoma Voice’s requests for comment on Tuesday.
During a press availability last week, Stitt first expressed frustration over how the agency responded to historic wildfires that began March 14. He lost a ranch in the fires.
Nearly 158 wildfires swept across the state, killing four and destroying more than 500 homes.
Stitt has previously said he fired the agency’s head, Mark Goeller, who denied wrongdoing. Many have expressed support for Goeller.
“I didn’t think they did a really good job,” Stitt said last week. “Here’s the deal. Why do I even have a Department of Forestry? Let’s just get rid of the whole thing.”
Goeller could not be reached for comment Tuesday.
Stitt’s remarks drew criticism from legislative leaders, including Hilbert, and local and volunteer fire departments.
When asked about Stitt’s claims that other Forestry Service leaders had been disciplined, Kirsten Hollansworth, a spokeswoman for the Oklahoma Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, said Tuesday that the agency does not comment on personnel matters.
Stitt was also asked why he didn’t declare a burn ban.
“It didn’t hit the threshold at that point, is what they told me,” Stitt said.
Stitt’s office did not respond to a question from Oklahoma Voice on Tuesday about whether he was out of town in March.
A Tulsa television station reported that Senate President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle, was acting governor during a portion of the fires. 
While Stitt has said half of the resources were not deployed, his office did not respond to a request for additional information.
Stitt’s office said Tuesday afternoon in a press release that he had formed a fire response working group to “enhance Oklahoma’s wildfire mitigation, suppression, and recovery capabilities.”

(Screenshot of SCETV legislative livestream)COLUMBIA — A pair of senators wants to remove a provision in state law that requires South Carolina’s Commission for Minority Affairs to have a majority-Black governing board.
The bill comes in the wake of a federal lawsuit filed by two women who say they were denied a spot on the commission when they sought to represent other minority groups. It’s co-sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Shane Massey, a white Republican from Edgefield, and Sen. Darrell Jackson, a Black Democrat from Hopkins.
A Senate panel voted unanimously Tuesday to advance the bill to the full Senate Judiciary Committee. Half of the six “yes” votes came from Black legislators.
Sandy Chiong, a Myrtle Beach-area woman of Chinese and Cuban heritage, was the first to file suit in December seeking a seat on the commission’s governing board.
The commission’s governing board is made up of one person from each of South Carolina’s seven congressional districts, as well as two at-large seats and a designee for the governor. The specification in the 1993 law that most of the board’s nine members “must be African American” violates the 14th Amendment of the Constitution, the lawsuit claimed.
SC woman sues over ‘racial quota’ for minority affairs board

“In America, government positions are supposed to be open to all citizens — not restricted to members of favored groups,” Chiong’s lawyers wrote in court documents. “A racial quota prevents her from being considered for a position on an equal basis with other candidates.”
Chief Michelle Mitchum of South Carolina’s Pine Hill Indian community later joined the lawsuit. Pine Hill, whose members once inhabited what became the U.S. Army’s Fort Jackson, is not a federal- or state-recognized tribe. However, South Carolina does recognize it as a special interest organization led by Mitchum.
A Senate panel heard from Mitchum on Tuesday, as well as from the director of the small state agency, Delores Dacosta. Both women spoke in favor of the bill.
When the Legislature established the Commission for Minority Affairs, the agency focused on addressing “inequities impacting African American communities,” hence the legislative mandate that its membership reflect the population it was formed to serve.
In 2003, its scope was broadened to include Asian Americans, Hispanic and Latino Americans, and Native Americans, according to agency documents. But the language governing the board’s makeup remained in place.

“We support this change to allow for the selection of commissioners to reflect the populations that we serve,” Dacosta said.
The agency holds community and networking events for minority businesspeople in the state.
It also puts out research each year tracking the growth of minority populations — where they’re living in South Carolina, where their children go to school, and their average income compared to the overall population — as well as disparities when it comes to health and affordable housing.
“I don’t see where this is going to hurt the commission,” Dacosta said about the bill. “As a matter of fact, I think it’s going to benefit because we have grown so much.”
Dacosta said when she started as head of the agency in 2018, it employed just nine people, six of those full time. Today, the agency has 24 employees.
“Our research is so broad … we need to see different faces on the board,” Dacosta added.
The legislation strikes language in the law relating to Black board members without replacing it with any new racial requirements for the commissioners.
Mitchum told senators they should instead set new criteria for minority membership, though she didn’t give any suggestions.
“I would like for you to replace the language — not just strike it,” she said. “Don’t respond to a lawsuit. Actually represent the minority population; actually lift our voice.”
Black residents are the largest racial minority in South Carolina, at 26% of the state population, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Hispanic residents make up 7.5% of the population, followed by 2% Asian and less than 1% Native American.
Chiong, who is the daughter of Cuban immigrants and is of Chinese, Cuban, and Spanish descent, did not come to Columbia to testify.
There are currently three vacancies on the 10-member board. They represent the 3rd District, which runs from Edgefield County to the state’s northwestern corner; the 4th District, which includes most of Greenville and Spartanburg counties; and one at-large member.
Two board members are serving past the expiration of their term in what’s known as holdover status, including the representative for the 7th District, where Chiong lives.
Dacosta said the commission has pending applications for two board appointments — the vacant 4th District seat and the expired term in the 6th District — and is “waiting to fill the other slots.”
The governor’s office also is in the process of nominating someone to fill the vacant 3rd District seat, spokesman Brandon Charochak said.
Four members of the commission are serving active terms. But three of their terms expire in July, according to the lawsuit.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/minority-affairs-1024x646.jpg,,,2025-04-08 18:08:43.580884

It was led by Maryland Democratic Sen. Chris Van Hollen.DHS did not respond to States Newsroom’s request for comment.Court battleThe U.S. Supreme Court on Monday temporarily paused a lower court order that required the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia from the prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.A full decision by the high court on whether the Trump administration would be required to return him is expected this week, and it could have implications for the more than 250 men who have been taken to the prison.The Trump administration has argued that Abrego Garcia is no longer in U.S. custody, despite paying El Salvador $6 million to detain him, along with other immigrants deported.Attorney General Pam Bondi spoke with reporters Tuesday outside the White House, and said she did not agree with the lower or appeals court orders to require the U.S. to return Abrego Garcia.“We believe he should stay where he is,” she said.Bondi also placed the DOJ attorney who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, Erez Reuveni, on indefinite administrative leave over the weekend.‘Need for due process’An appeals court Monday unanimously upheld an order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis that the administration return Abrego Garcia to the U.S. by midnight Monday.The 24 Democratic senators and one independent argued the Trump administration should comply with the order by Xinis.“The Administration’s mass deportation agenda does not transcend immigration law or the need for due process,” according to the letter.“And when the Administration makes a mistake as severe as sending an individual with protected status to a foreign prison, it cannot simply shrug off responsibility and allege that there is nothing it can do to reunite him with his wife and child, who are American citizens,” according to the letter.The letter also requires Noem and ICE to answer several questions and return answers by April 22.The senators ask why the agency and ICE are not working to return a wrongly deported individual, as the agencies have done so in the past and why Trump officials like the vice president and White House press secretary continue to label Abrego Garcia, of Beltsville, as a gang member without evidence.The letter also asks for a copy of the contract agreement between El Salvador and the U.S. to detain the immigrants at CECOT.List of senatorsThe 24 Senate Democrats on the letter besides Van Hollen included Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed of Rhode Island; Peter Welch of Vermont; Adam Schiff and Alex Padilla of California; Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey of Massachusetts; Richard Durbin and Tammy Duckworth of Illinois; Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut; Cory Booker of New Jersey; Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire; Tim Kaine and Mark Warner of Virginia; Christopher Coons of Delaware; Mazie Hirono and Brian Schatz of Hawaii; Ron Wyden and Jeffrey Merkley of Oregon; Martin Heinrich of New Mexico; Angela Alsobrooks of Maryland; Gary Peters of Michigan; and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota.Independent Bernie Sanders of Vermont also signed the letter.",,,,2025-04-08 18:08:43.580884

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A Senate committee has approved a House bill calling for cellphone bans in public schools, setting the stage for final negotiations on a major policy priority for Oklahoma lawmakers.
The Senate Education Committee advanced House Bill 1276 with a 7-4 vote on Tuesday. Similar legislation from the Senate is on the agenda for the House Common Education Committee’s meeting Wednesday.
HB 1276 would require every district in the state to develop a policy restricting student use of cellphones and personal electronic devices for the entire school day, starting next school year. The bill leaves the door open for local school boards to opt out and continue permitting student cellphone use in their districts.
Similar legislation that originated in the Senate, SB 139, would mandate a cellphone ban in all public schools for a year with no chance for districts to opt out until after the 2025-26 academic year. Districts would have the choice after the first year whether to keep the prohibition in place.
Each version would allow students to use their cellphones for medically necessary reasons or in emergency cases.
Sen. Ally Seifried, R-Claremore, and Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, are the authors of both bills.
If both bills pass the committee stage, Seifried said House and Senate lawmakers will discuss which version has the most support from the full Legislature. 
Allowing districts the chance to opt out of the cellphone ban has been a priority of the House, Seifried said. The message she heard most often from fellow senators is “let’s get it done,” she said.

“I think we’ll eventually get together and decide which version will pass and which can gain the most consensus,” Seifried said after the committee vote. “We wanted to get both through committee. We really are working together on this quite closely, and so that’ll be for us to decide in the coming weeks.”
House lawmakers passed HB 1276 with overwhelming support from both parties. The Senate passed SB 139 along party lines.
The policy of restricting cellphones in schools has enjoyed vocal support from Gov. Kevin Stitt and legislative leaders. If one of the measures becomes law, Oklahoma would join nine other states, including California and Arkansas, that have enacted a ban on cellphones in schools.
Oklahoma lawmakers have been looking into the issue since before the 2025 session began. Both chambers hosted fall interim studies examining the detriments of digital media on children and the benefits of cellphone bans in Oklahoma schools that already have these restrictions in place.

Caldwell said he and Seifried agree educators, parents and students would recognize the positive impact once a statewide ban is in place.
He decided to include a district opt-out provision in HB 1276, he said, after having conversations with House leadership and fellow representatives. Caldwell said he hopes both the House and Senate versions advance past the committee stage for consideration in final negotiations.
“This truly has a chance to make transformative change in our schools, and that’s not something we get a chance to do every day,” Caldwell said.

(Daniella Heminghaus for New Jersey Monitor)A group of South Jersey Democrats on Tuesday sued Camden County Clerk Pamela Lampitt, alleging she is violating a new primary ballot design law by declining to place individual ovals next to the names of dozens of county committee candidates there.
The suit, filed by four county committee candidates backed by a group called South Jersey Progressive Democrats, alleges the clerk’s move for June 10’s primary violates a provision of the new law requiring that ovals or other spaces for voters to mark their vote appear “to the left or to the right of the name of each candidate.”
“The law plainly requires that the voter may indicate his or her choice next to the name of each candidate for each office with an oval or other appropriate mark,” the suit says, adding “Despite the crystal-clear clarity of the law, the Camden County Clerk’s Office has recently indicated to candidates and the public that it apparently does not intend to honor the oval-mandate.”
County committee races decide who the rank-and-file members of each county’s Democratic and Republican parties will be. There are 74 Democratic county committee seats up this year in Cherry Hill and 18 in nearby Collingswood. South Jersey Progressive Democrats are running for three of the Cherry Hill seats and one in Collingswood. The other candidates are all backed by the Camden County Democratic Committee, whose leadership has locked horns with South Jersey Progressive Democrats.
 An old Camden County ballot shows how the county clerk wants to design this year’s ballot, with one oval next to each set of county committee candidates, according to claims in a new lawsuit.
Lampitt wants a ballot that will lump all the Camden County Democratic Committee candidates next to one oval and group the South Jersey Progressive Democrats next to another oval, according to the lawsuit.
“This effectively means that Cherry Hill voters cannot vote for the individual candidates who they may personally know from local community events, and are forced to choose between one grouping or another, rather than individual selections,” it says.
At a ballot draw conducted last week, an official from the clerk’s office said the sheer number of county committee candidates in some of Camden’s larger municipalities could prohibit listing county committee candidates individually.
“Most of the towns are small enough that their county committees will fit into individual boxes, but Cherry Hill, Gloucester Township — the larger municipalities — won’t physically fit onto a piece of paper,” Camden County Deputy Clerk John Schmidt said shortly before the ballot draw. “We’re not at the point yet where we know exactly how it’s going to be laid out and, physically, where that limit is.”
Camden County has not yet released its proposed ballot design, though a list of candidates the county published assigned individual position numbers to every candidate.
An attorney for the county served a copy of the filing did not immediately return a request for comment.

Jill Carter, a Republican from Granby, presents a bill in a Senate committee earlier this year. She first started coming to the Missouri State Capitol as a public-school parent advocating for change for her son's school (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate set aside legislation Tuesday afternoon proposing alternative methods of school certification after senators discussed the impact of standardized testing and accountability for nearly two hours.
State Sen. Jill Carter, a Granby Republican, has filed the bill during each of her three years in office, but it has never passed the Senate. On Monday, she unsuccessfully attempted to add the legislation as an amendment to another education bill.
The bill debated Tuesday, she explained, is the brainchild of her time as a public-school parent.
She sought change in her local school district, talking first to parents, then to teachers and the school board. The hangup came from state officials, she said, who mandate that public schools administer a standardized test and score districts on the results.
She came to the State Capitol asking lawmakers to give school boards more autonomy. Now in the position of legislator, she has annually proposed her idea to decentralize standardized tests.
“It is putting public schools on the same playing field, giving them the same opportunities as private schools or parochial schools,” she said in the Senate Tuesday afternoon. “What we’re trying to do is get an even playing field so that they have the opportunity to be innovative.”
Missouri lawmaker seeks to remove focus on statewide standardized testing for accreditation

But her bill, which received praise from public-school groups at the committee level, has its critics in the state’s legislature.
State Sen. Curtis Trent, a Republican from Springfield, told Carter that he has concerns about accountability.
“There (should be) accountability when we are writing a taxpayer check and sending it to a government school,” he said.
Carter’s bill would allow schools to seek accreditation from national organizations, like those used by private schools, instead of being beholden to standards set by the state Department of Elementary and Secondary Education.
The statewide standardized test, the Missouri Assessment Program, would only be used to meet federal requirements.
Carter added a five-year sunset to the bill, hoping to win over skeptics in the Senate, but it wasn’t enough to convince Trent. Districts would have no incentive to perform well without a performance report from the state, he told her.
Carter pointed to legislation that would allow public-school students to transfer to schools outside their address, dubbed open enrollment. Trent is sponsoring the Senate’s version of the proposal, which has sat on the body’s calendar for weeks without discussion. The House’s open enrollment legislation is due for Senate debate in coming days, with a Senate committee hearing scheduled for later this week.
“This is a both-and conversation and not an either-or,” Carter said.
Trent feared lawmakers would lose their grip on public schools if national accreditation agencies became responsible for assessing school performance.
“If we decouple the assessments from the accreditation process, we have to put something else in place that this body still has control of,” he said. “We don’t have any control over these nationwide accrediting agencies, so we will have ceded all of our authority as the General Assembly of Missouri from any control over these government schools.”
Despite opposition from Trent, the bill has supporters on both sides of the aisle.
State Sen. Mike Henderson, a Desloge Republican, said he has concerns about the state’s standardized test and wonders whether performance scores are accurate after speaking with his 12-year-old grandson about the assessment.
“He has already figured out (the test) didn’t really mean anything to him. It didn’t affect his grade,” Henderson said. “And he’s not the only one. Many of them have figured that out, so sometimes I wonder how true of a snapshot it is.”
State Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern, a Kansas City Democrat and former educator, applauded the bill for the “flexibility” teachers would get in the classroom.
“If we were to pass this, we would see drastic improvement and education,” she said, saying that educators are currently “handcuffed by state tests.”
After just under two hours of discussion, Senate Majority Leader Tony Luetkemeyer, a Parkville Republican, whispered to Carter, and she laid the bill aside, saying time had run out.

Teresa Ibach, Chancellor Joanne Li (UNO), interim Chancellor H. Dele Davies (UNMC) and interim Chancellor Charlie Bicak (UNK). April 2, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The University of Nebraska is no longer set to receive a decrease in its state-aided budget after the Legislature’s budget-setting committee Tuesday reversed its earlier decision.
Gov. Jim Pillen had recommended a 2% cut for NU in January, which the committee had preliminarily accepted. But in a 7-1 vote, with State Sen. Ashlei Spivey of Omaha “present, not voting,” the Appropriations Committee opted instead to increase NU’s general fund state appropriation by 1.25% in the next fiscal year. 
NU currently gets about $700 million from the state each year from this bucket of funds, which is 20.1% of NU’s $3.5 billion operating budget.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams proposed the one-time 1.25% increase after NU President Jeffrey Gold and Pillen, and their respective staff, continued to negotiate.


NU operating budget sources
The University of Nebraska has a $3.5 billion operating budget for the current fiscal year ending June 30. The different funding sources, according to NU, are:

State appropriations ($695.4 million, 20.1%).
Tuition ($374.8 million, 10.8%).
Other cash, such as investment income or fees ($19.3 million, 0.6%).
Designated cash from clinic patient revenues, tobacco research funds or indirect cost research incentive funds ($125.6 million, 3.6%).
Federal funds ($752.6 million, 21.7%).
Revolving funds, including self-generated revenue from departmental sales, course and lab fees and charges and housing or dining ($889 million, 25.7%).
Trust funds, including private gifts, grants or contracts and non-federal student aid programs ($606.6 million, 17.5%).



The committee delayed reconsideration of NU’s budget multiple days last week after a disagreement on the specifics of a deal between Gold and Pillen. Both had agreed to a 1.25% increase, but Gold thought it was for both years. Pillen’s staff said it was for one year.
Gold, in a brief afternoon call, said he was “deeply grateful” for the change, which he said is “certainly a lot better” than a cut.
“Anything that they can do to help us keep education high quality and affordable in the state and to further our research mission is always appreciated,” Gold told the Nebraska Examiner.
Tuition hike, future cuts possible
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha, who said NU deserved a larger increase, opposed Dorn’s proposal.
The change means NU would see an overall increase of $8.7 million in the next fiscal year to its state-aided budget and be held flat at that new level in the second year. The NU Board of Regents in August requested a 3.5% increase each year.
“As this is substantially less than that, it will, unfortunately, force us to have some very serious discussions regarding tuition in each year at the upcoming biennium and, thereafter, some very serious discussions about belt-tightening and further budgetary reduction across all of the campuses, colleges and institutes in the state,” Gold said.
Clements, committee chair, said his team continues to try to rightsize the state budget in face of a projected $457 million projected budget shortfall over the next two fiscal years. He said that both the governor and NU engaged in what he described as “give and take on both sides.” 
He noted the reversal will increase the budget hole that the committee is working toward. Combined with the previous cut, it’s about $46 million that the committee will need to find. Clements had released a preliminary committee budget in February that made progress toward closing the projected shortfall, trimming it down to $289 million.
Larger increase rejected
The committee on Tuesday also rejected a proposal by State Sen. Jason Prokop of Lincoln for an additional 1.25% increase in the second fiscal year, on a 5-4 vote.
State Sen. Rob Dover of Norfolk, a Republican, joined Prokop, Cavanaugh and Spivey, all Democrats, for the added increase. State Sens. Rob Clements of Elmwood, Christy Armendariz of Omaha, Myron Dorn of Adams, Loren Lippincott of Central City and Paul Strommen of Sidney rejected the increase. The Legislature is officially nonpartisan.

Pillen, who joined the NU Board of Regents in 2013 before becoming governor in 2023, also disagreed with NU’s budget request two years ago. The committee landed in between them then, too.
Dover said he wanted to give NU more but that the committee needed to decide and move on. Dorn said lawmakers needed to be careful with the projected budget deficit.
Biomedical research, Project Health
The committee also voted Tuesday to restore $5 million for biomedical research at postsecondary institutions — $3 million to NU. About 4.67% of the $15 million in state funds dedicated for such research annually remains earmarked for research to improve racial and ethnic minority health. Pillen recommended that the committee remove the specific earmark.

NU also will get $50 million each year from the state’s tobacco settlement fund for Project Health in Omaha, rather than from the state’s “rainy day” cash reserves. The Legislature has adopted a statement of intent to fund $300 million for NU’s project, over six years.
Project Health, a new $2.19 billion health care facility at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and Nebraska Medicine, is planned to serve as a clinical learning center to “train the “next generation of health care providers, conduct research and offer clinical trials,” according to an NU news release.
This is Gold’s first year as president. He previously served as UNMC chancellor for 10 years.
Gold said the restoration of funds will have a 10-to-1 return on investment on general appropriations as well as a 16-to-1 return on new research dollars. He said that could lead to new medications and diagnostics that, hopefully, enhance the health and wellness of Nebraskans.
“This will give us an opportunity to continue to further the mission but also to support the future economy of the state,” Gold said. “I only hope that over time the overall revenue to the state continues to grow, so we can invest even more in the university that produces the future workforce and does all this very important research.”

(Photo courtesy Santa Fe Public Schools)New Mexico educators say federal demands to ban diversity, equity and inclusion programs or lose funding are “frustrating” and it’s unclear how they might ultimately impact students. 
The U.S. Department of Education sent a letter to state education leaders last week ordering them to certify their compliance with federal requirements banning diversity, equity and inclusion practices in order to continue receiving federal assistance.
States were given 10 days to respond to the letter, but a spokesperson for the federal education department told Source NM that the deadline was extended to April 24. 
Michael Chavez, superintendent of Hatch Valley Public Schools, told Source NM that he feels districts are in a “wait and see” situation and that he hasn’t received any specific directive from the New Mexico Public Education Department about how the state will respond.
“I guess the first question I have is: ‘What does that mean for us?’” he said. “I don’t know what that means because we’re all about providing equity…Are we talking equality or we talking equity, because that’s two different things.”
Hatch Valley Public Schools consists of five schools from elementary to high school, and serves fewer than 2,000 students. A majority of children come from families living below the poverty line and many are English Language Learners, Chavez said.
Chavez told Source that about 15 to 20% of the Hatch Valley district’s budget is made up of federal funds. He pointed out that Title I and Title II funds are particularly important to the Hatch Valley district as they provide federal financial assistance for at-risk students as well as professional development for teachers serving these students.
“We’ll roll with the punches and do whatever we have to do, but we’re not going to compromise on providing equitable services for kids,” Chavez said. He added that a majority of his district’s budget comes from the state and described the federal money as “extra” for expanding programs even further.
He noted that the spring budget conference for all public schools in the state is this week — during which districts develop their budgets for the next year — and said he hopes the state will “share with us any information that they have.”
Janelle Taylor Garcia, a spokesperson for the state education department, said in a written statement to Source NM that the department “is working closely with the New Mexico Department of Justice and the Governor’s Office on addressing these directives. NMPED will continue to monitor communications from the U.S. Department of Education and remains focused on supporting districts and charters in serving all our student populations in the state.”
Stan Rounds, executive director of the New Mexico Coalition of Educational Leaders, told Source that he is working with Education Secretary Mariana Padilla as much as possible to develop a strategy for dealing with the Trump administration’s demands. He said he is also working with the American Association of School Administrators, his organization’s federal counterpart.
“Our hope is to be able to retain programs and funds that have been in play, so it’s navigation as much as anything that we’re having to do,” Rounds told Source. 
Whitney Holland, president of the American Federation of Teachers New Mexico chapter, told Source that from the perspective of teachers in the state, “our students are being used as political pawns.” She said she is concerned for the “unique populations” of students who require additional assistance federal money pays for, as well as school social workers and occupational therapists.
“And that is super, super frustrating because we’ve hit this really good stride where every year we’re chipping away at the narrative of 51st in education and school funding and all of that. And then to have this come, this blow come from the federal level, it feels like a huge step backwards,” Holland said. 
She added that if the certification letter does not work to satisfy federal demands, she anticipates the Trump administration will “continue to put the pressure on.”

Jeff Landry and the companies involved announced Tuesday. CF Industries, which has teased the project since 2023, revealed its funding partners that intend to move the development forward.
CF Industries already operates the largest existing ammonia and nitrogen plant in Donaldsonville, where it has manufactured the main components of agricultural fertilizer since the early 1970s. Its new $4 billion facility will annually produce 1.4 million metric tons of blue ammonia, which is produced using carbon capture technology to store its greenhouse gas emissions.
Tony Will, CF Industries president and CEO, said the new plant will supplement the existing ammonia production site that will also sequester the carbon dioxide it produces. The company ultimately plans to invest in green ammonia production, which uses only renewable power sources and is carbon neutral, he added.

CF Industries is partnering on the project with JERA Co. Inc, a Japanese ammonia producer, and Mitsui & Co. Ltd., a Tokyo-based diversified trading and investment company. Yukio Kani, JERA’s global chairman and CEO, said his company is investing $1.4 billion in what will be called the Blue Point Complex. 
JERA already does business with Louisiana’s liquified natural gas export facilities, Kani added. 
Gov. Jeff Landry heralded Tuesday’s news as another example of Louisiana “winning” in the economic development realm. It comes on the heels of Hyundai’s announcement late last month at the White House that it will build a $5.8 billion steel mill in Ascension Parish to support its U.S. auto manufacturing sites.
“We are living up to the promises we made when we started to focus on business and industries that built this state,” the governor said. 
The Blue Point Complex will be built near the Hyundai plant on the west bank of Ascension Parish, in the 17,000-plus-acre RiverPlex MegaPark north of Donaldsonville.
Salaries will average $110,000 for the 103 permanent jobs the CF Industries plant will create, according to Louisiana Economic Development (LED). Construction of the facility will result in some 1,500 construction jobs, on top of the 5,000 for the Hyundai steel mill.
The blue ammonia plant is expected to become operational by 2029, according to CF Industries.
LED Secretary Susan Bourgeois confirmed area community and technical colleges will be tapped to train the workforce needed for the CF Industries and Hyundai projects, including their permanent hires.
To lure the project to Louisiana, the state offered CF Industries a $6 million performance-based grant for the money it spends on project development and infrastructure. The company will also participate in the state’s Industrial Tax Exemption Program, which provides a break on local property taxes, and is expected to use the Quality Jobs program that refunds payroll taxes for new positions created.
The governor said CF Industries has reached an agreement to make an up front payment to Ascension Parish in lieu of paying property taxes. Terms of that PILOT arrangement weren’t immediately available.  
Will said CF Industries chose the Donaldsonville site because of Louisiana’s skilled workforce, strategic infrastructure, abundant natural resources and access to carbon capture capabilities. 
Asked what impact the Trump administration’s far-reaching import tariffs might have on the project, Will said foreign components for the facility aren’t expected to arrive in Louisiana for another three years. 
“My hope is that between now and then progress has been made on the international trade front,” Will said.
The Blue Point Complex is arguably the most significant development in the ammonia marketplace since the European Union put in place its Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism almost two years ago. 
The CBAM policy is intended to prevent so-called “carbon leakage,” which happens when industry moves operations to a country with more lax environmental laws. The mechanism adds a cost to imported goods that accounts for their carbon emissions.

South Bow shut down the pipeline at 7:42 a.m. Tuesday after a drop in pressure. The spill was about three miles north of Fort Ransom State Park or six miles south of Kathryn in Barnes County. 
The North Dakota Department of Environmental Quality said it does not yet know how much oil was spilled but that the oil is contained to a farm field south of a pipeline pump station. 
Bill Suess with the Division of Water Quality for DEQ said it was not clear how many acres of the field were contaminated. 
Suess said the pipeline was shut down within minutes of the pressure dropping. 
He said it was unknown how long the pipeline would be shut down. 
The pipeline is 30 inches in diameter in that area, Suess said, but did not know how deep it was buried. 
The pipeline takes oil from Alberta, east to Manitoba and the south through the Midwest to the Gulf Coast. 
Suess said the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration would be on site Wednesday to investigate. The Department of Environmental Quality will oversee cleanup efforts.

Laura Kelly signs a bill complying with her request for the Legislature to create a special task force to put together a comprehensive water planning and investment task force modeled after the state's 10-year planning horizon for highway projects. (Tim Carpenter/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Gov. Laura Kelly signed bipartisan legislation Tuesday establishing a task force dedicated to developing a long-term investment strategy for Kansas water resources modeled after the state’s rolling 10-year transportation program.
The Democratic governor praised members of the Republican-led Legislature for approving House Bill 2172 to create a dedicated funding source for addressing  the state’s water challenges. The task force with 13 voting members must work to get a better handle on evaluation of water appropriations and state water laws.  The task force will submit to Kelly and the Legislature a preliminary report in 2026 and a final report in 2027.
“Developing a comprehensive, long-term and sustainable water program is long overdue and a significant step forward in ensuring Kansas’ water supply is preserved for generations to come,” Kelly said. “I commend the Legislature for advancing my proposal and acting on this critical issue.”
The bill passed the House on a vote of 116-8 and it received unanimous support in the Senate. In January, Kelly recommended the Legislature authorize the task force. The Kansas Water Authority and Kelly administration conducted 14 public meetings last year to gather input on water policy.
The task force, with members from each of the state’s five conservation regions, must work to evaluate major risks to Kansas’ water quality and quantity, including issues of current and future economic growth. It must evaluate water infrastructure needs in every corner of the state.
“This is a critical step forward in addressing Kansas’ water challenges by establishing a dedicated task force and work group to guide our state’s water policy and funding decisions,” said Senate President Ty Masterson, R-Andover. “This bill reflects a bipartisan legislative commitment to ensuring sustainable water resources for future generations, and I’m proud to see it move forward with the governor’s support.”
Kelly also signed Senate Bill 45, which created an alternative school district graduation rate calculation that excluded students who transferred to homeschools and nonaccredited private schools or who enrolled as a credit-deficient student.
The governor signed Senate Bill 54 to require disclosure in court proceedings of third-party litigation funding agreements as well as House Bill 2118 requiring private entities that solicit a fee for filing or retrieving government documents to tell consumers the solicitations weren’t made on behalf of a government agency.
Kelly put a signature to House Bill 2030 to exclude dealers and manufacturers of nonmotorized trailers from the vehicle dealers licensing law. It wouldn’t apply to dealers of semitrailers and travel trailers.
Her signing of House Bill 2122 meant the annual license fee of electric and hybrid vehicles would increase. The fee for electric hybrid vehicles would go from $50 to $70, while the plug-in electric hybrid vehicle fee would rise from $50 to $100. The all-electric vehicle would be hit with a fee of $165, up from $100.
She placed into law contents of House Bill 2016 to give active military members, their spouses and dependents stationed in Kansas but maintaining residency in another state to serve as poll workers for Kansas elections. In addition, the bill permitted county election officers to rely on obituaries posted online to remove a voter’s name from registration books.
The governor agreed to sign House Bill 2168 to extend the time required for filing of public land surveys from 30 days to 90 days to comply with industry standards. Meanwhile, Kelly signed House Bill 2242 to authorize a Kansas governor to accept requests for concurrent jurisdiction from the federal government.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Kelly-podcast-1-16x9-1-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-08 17:07:22.787412

It moved on a 66-28 vote, mostly along party lines.
The sponsoring Republican, Rep. Brad Barrett, of Richmond, pointed to funding concerns for the state’s fastest-growing expenditure, saying limiting enrollment would preserve the government insurance option for the neediest. 
He acknowledged the outpouring of personal stories in committee, calling it a “perfect storm” between expiring COVID-era enrollment protections, a federal court ruling and state costs. 
“We’re really forced to do something this legislative session,” Barrett said.
Under Senate Bill 2, those enrolled in the Healthy Indiana Plan — which covers low- to moderate-income Hoosiers between the ages of 19 and 64 — will need to either work or volunteer for 20 hours each week, with several exceptions for caregivers, disabled beneficiaries and more.
That group is essentially the expansion population authorized by the legislature in 2015.

The bill also moves toward retroactive eligibility, rather than presumptive eligibility, and restricts the advertising of Medicaid services.
Democrats decried adding an additional administrative burden on the Family and Social Services Administration by increasing eligibility checks from annually to quarterly.
“I don’t know how many of you have actually been on Medicaid. I don’t know how many of you have actually gone through a Medicaid redetermination process. I don’t know how many of you have been in fear of losing your health insurance,” said Rep. Robin Shackleford, D-Indianapolis. “That is what we’re talking about here. It’s not that we are forced to do something. We are forced to make sure that we are ensuring that the Hoosiers in our state are protected.”
She pointed to a forecasting error that created a nearly $1 billion shortfall in the Medicaid program, saying the state should shoulder that expense rather than curbing services for Hoosiers. 
“At the end of the day, we’re going to pay for these services. Either we pay because the people need services and they’ll be going to the emergency room. Or we’re going to be paying less because we are providing preventative services to people on the front end,” said Rep. Cherrish Pryor, D-Indianapolis. 
Just one lawmaker crossed over to vote against their caucus: Rep. Wendy Dant Chesser, a Democrat from Jeffersonville. Only Barrett spoke in support of the bill’s Medicaid work requirements, saying action was needed to maintain the program’s stability.
“(In committee), we heard of people that were just thrilled with the benefits they receive in this space. We’re simply looking to make sure that those that need the services, get the services,” Barrett said.
Due to several House amendments — including one to omit a numerical cap — the Senate must concur, or agree, with the latest version before it can go before Gov. Mike Braun for a signature.

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)April Tardiff, a mother of three from Old Orchard Beach, told the Taxation Committee that expanding Maine’s version of a child tax credit would allow her to worry less and focus on raising happy, healthy children, one of which had wriggled free from his seat and ran around the room as she testified. 
“After paying for groceries, diapers, rent, transportation and utilities, there’s nothing left,” Tardiff said, explaining that her family falls in the category of Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed, or ALIC, which refers to households earning above the federal poverty level but not enough to afford basic necessities. “Some months, we’re just holding on until the next paycheck arrives.” 
Other parents, medical professionals, educators and policy experts testified in support of legislation that would double the state’s child tax credit for some recipients, which would be paid for by phasing out the benefit for the state’s highest earners. 
LD 1294, proposed by Senate President Mattie Daughtry (D-Brunswick) with bipartisan co-sponsors, would provide an additional $300 per child under six years old for the Dependent Exemption Tax Credit, for a total of $600 per child per tax year. 
“At the end of the day. This bill is about values. It’s about recognizing the hard work and sacrifices that parents make every day and ensuring that our tax code reflects that reality,” Daughtry said. “Additionally, which I am proud to say in the budget outlook that we exist in currently, this proposal is designed to be revenue neutral.” 










It seems like it's not a lot, but we've all seen the prices going up on everything. I think $300 is a small price to pay for dignity.


– Hazel Willow


Currently, the phase out rate for the credit begins at $400,000 for married couples filing jointly and $200,000 for all other filers. LD 1294 would lower the phase out threshold — $100,000 for single filers, $125,000 for head of households, $150,000 for married people filing jointly. 
Gov. Janet Mills’ administration is recommending the changes proposed in the bill be delayed until the 2026 tax year to give the state time and ability to react to any changes to the federal child tax credit, said Michael Allen, associate commissioner for tax policy for the Department of Administrative and Financial Services, testifying neither for nor against the legislation. 
Currently, the maximum federal credit is $2,000 per qualifying child for an individual making less than $200,000 annually or a couple filing jointly that makes less than $400,000 — a refundability cap President Donald Trump increased with a 2017 tax law during his last presidency, expanding the credit to wealthier Americans. That law is set to expire at the end of 2025, though congressional Republicans have advanced a plan to continue those cuts. 
Many who testified in support of the legislation said the additional credit is particularly helpful for parents of young children because of the high cost of child care. 
Given that reasoning, Rep. Shelley Rudnicki (R-Fairfield) questioned whether it would be more effective to loosen child care regulations instead. But child care providers pushed back, arguing that would loosen the quality of the care and that liability insurance would likely refuse to insure providers. 
Others on the committee posed questions to the public about whether an extra $300 would truly make a difference. 
With her young son holding onto her dress at the podium, Hazel Willow responded that that amount would allow her to enroll her child in a sport or buy clothes rather than rely on shelter hand me downs. A survivor of domestic abuse, Willow added that the extra money is also about giving autonomy back to the people who’ve had it stripped away by trauma and circumstance.
“It seems like it’s not a lot, but we’ve all seen the prices going up on everything,” Willow said. “I think $300 is a small price to pay for dignity.”

One day before the public hearing on Tuesday, Daughtry, child care providers and parents gathered at the Magic Years Center, which provides Head Start, preschool and childcare for young children in the Augusta area, to share their support for the legislation. 
Tabitha Thomas, a mother of six in Waterville, said increasing the tax credit would help her afford things others may take for granted, such as being able to pay rent and take her children to important appointments. Thomas is a student at Kennebec Valley Community College, studying mental health and case management, and works part time in food service at Colby College. 
“I would work more but between long hours being a mom and going to school it is impossible to fulfill the needs of my children while still keeping up financially,” Thomas said. 
That’s why the tax credit is crucial for her family, Thomas said. That is also true for Raychel Ward’s family. Ward, a mother of three from Livermore Falls, said she’d use the extra money to pay for visits to the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia for her five month old son, who has a condition where he produces too much insulin that few doctors specialize in. 
“The thing is, for families with special needs children, we don’t have wiggle room,” Thomas said. “Every dollar that comes into our house is already allocated to meet their needs, whether it’s getting them to the therapy appointments, making sure our cars are maintained or making sure that they get to see specialists that maybe aren’t deemed necessary.”
The expansion of the federal child tax credit during the COVID-19 pandemic had helped her and her husband put window and door alarms on their apartment as one of her daughters, who is on the autism spectrum, had been getting out, she said.  
For the 2021 tax year, the federal credit was increased to $3,600 per child under six and $3,000 per child aged six to 17 and switched to monthly, rather than annual, payments for the first several months. The expansion cut child poverty in half nationwide but those gains have since been erased with the expiration of the enhanced credit at the end of 2021. 
Maine picked up where Congress left off, said Ann Danforth, policy advocate for Maine Equal Justice, pointing to the Legislature making the state credit refundable and indexing it to inflation in 2023. 
“We have the chance to continue that progress,” Danforth said. “Child poverty is not an unsolvable problem.” 
According to the most recent data available from 2023, Maine has a child poverty rate of 12.6%, which is a historic low. The number of children in poverty in Maine has declined in recent years, but the overall share of Mainers living in “deep poverty” — with incomes less than half the official poverty level — has slightly increased.
Garrett Martin, president and CEO of the Maine Center for Economic Policy, called the child tax credit expansion a smart economic move for Maine, citing research that shows families use child tax credits for basic needs such as food, school expenses and child care.
“This is an economic investment with long-term returns: higher earnings, better health outcomes, and stronger communities,” Martin said.

(Photo via Getty Images; logo courtesy of the State of Iowa) The Iowa Senate passed a bill clarifying some parts of the process for the state’s review of “immediate jeopardy” violations at Iowa nursing homes, but did not approve changes suggested by Democratic senators to increase oversight and regulation over care facilities in the state.
House File 309, passed 39-9 Tuesday, was described by the bill’s floor manager Sen. Kara Warme, R-Ames, as a small, technical correction to a law passed in 2024 on Iowa nursing home oversight. In 2024, the Legislature approved a measure requiring the Iowa Department of Inspections, Appeals and Licensing, the state entity charged with nursing home oversight, to allow nursing homes to review potential citations for substandard care and placing residents in immediate jeopardy of serious injury or death.
During the review process with DIAL, facilities would be able to provide additional “context and evidence” before the state agency would make a decision on issuing a citation. Under previous law, nursing homes were able to provide additional context after citations were issued.
The legislation sent to Gov. Kim Reynolds Tuesday would clarify that the review process would happen for each instance of a “deficient practice identified by the department for which a citation may be issued,” and that the review process only applies to nursing facilities and not all health facilities. However, advocates for Iowa seniors and other critics said the measure, within the larger discussion of the 2024 law, could conflict with federal law or lead to fewer citations for legitimate cases of substandard care.

While the measure is a relatively minor change to Iowa’s laws on nursing homes, the bill is also currently the only legislation dealing with nursing home regulation to survive past the second funnel deadline of the 2025 legislative session. Using the legislation as a vehicle for a larger discussion on nursing home inspections and care, Senate Democrats introduced four amendments they argued would help prevent resident abuse and neglect at Iowa care facilities.
Senate Minority Leader Janice Weiner introduced two amendments, both of which were ruled out of order, one of which would allocate $600,000 in funding for DIAL to hire 30 new inspectors, increase penalties for certain regulatory violations by facilities and give DIAL a shorter time frame to respond to complaints.
“The bill is currently written is lopsided in favor of those who run nursing homes, when those we should be protecting are our seniors,” Weiner said. “And this amendment balances and remedies that.”
The other amendment proposed a ban on private equity funds’ ability to acquire Iowa nursing homes. While speaking on the measures, Weiner referenced several Iowa Capital Dispatch reports on violations that occurred in care facilities, including a case in Keota, where a resident at a care facility died from complications resulting from a fall after being found lying with bleeding head wound but not being transferred to a hospital until 15 days later. She also cited a case in Wellman, where a nursing home worker found a woman lying on the floor with a “big goose egg” on the side of her head but was put to bed instead of being provided medical assistance.
“These are not just awful individual stories, they’re part of an incredibly problematic data set,” Weiner said. “According to a federal database, Iowa is one of the worst performing states for nursing home violations, with triple the violations of what would be expected for our state’s population.”
Two other amendments, from Democratic Sens. Tony Bisignano of Des Moines and Molly Donahue of Marion, proposed stopping care facilities from being able to ban residents and their guardians from installing video cameras in residents’ rooms, and from allowing nursing home residents to also submit context and evidence to DIAL during the review process. These measures were also not accepted by the Republican-controlled Senate.
Three of the four amendments were bills introduced by Senate Democrats in early March as pieces of a 14-bill package on Iowa nursing homes. None of these measures survived the first funnel deadline. Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, criticized Republicans for rejecting the measures as non-germane or irrelevant to include in the legislation, as the majority party has previously passed “strike-all amendments” on the floor rewriting the entire content of bills.
“We were told that the Republican Party is sympathetic to the plight of Iowa seniors who are facing unbelievable horrors in these facilities — that their safety is a top priority,” Wahls said. “These amendments didn’t need to have their germaneness questioned. These amendments would have materially improved legislation and created important protections for Iowa seniors who live in these facilities and whose families count on these facilities to provide these services. … So I don’t want to hear it that these amendments weren’t logical, weren’t connected to the legislation. We had an opportunity to hear from the public on these bills, and the Republican majority decided not to give any of those three bills, those three amendments, a hearing.”
Warme said the bill was a technical fix of the established policy for addressing situations involving residents in immediate jeopardy, “with the goal of problem solving and improving care in our nursing facilities.” She thanked Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, for saying many facilities and workers are trying to do their best.
“I agree with that, and the way that others would describe their amendments, you’d think that these nursing facilities are staffed by monsters,” Warme said. “I appreciate the health care workers, nurses and CNAs, who are doing so much to care our elderly in these facilities.”

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) The man Pope Francis has picked to lead Rhode Island’s Roman Catholics spoke out six years ago when the first Trump administration planned a mass deportation of undocumented immigrants. At the time, the Most Rev. Bruce A. Lewandowski was an auxiliary bishop for the Archdiocese of Baltimore.
“If something is wrong, it’s up to the church to speak out,” Lewandowski told reporters Tuesday. “To be human is to be political, right?”
His comments came Tuesday morning when he was formally introduced as the 10th bishop of the Diocese of Providence at the Cathedral of Saints Peter and Paul — a little more than five months after his predecessor left to lead the Archdiocese of Boston. 
Lewandowski will officially be installed to his new duties May 20. 
He succeeds the Most Rev. Richard Henning, who was selected by Pope Francis last August to lead the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston. 
Lewandowski is fluent in Spanish and Portuguese, something he was quick to showcase during his Rhode Island introduction. He was often brought to tears as he spoke in Spanish.
“Con más de 30 años sirviendo a la comunidad Hispana, es mi vida,” he said. (“With more than 30 years serving the Hispanic community, this is my life.”)
A native of Toledo, Ohio, Lewandowski grew up on a farm before being ordained a priest in 1994 in Washington D.C. He did missionary work in the Caribbean and was a pastor in the Bronx and Philadelphia before serving in Baltimore.
Henning commended Lewandowski’s appointment to his former diocese.
“I have a deep love for that diocese and its people, and I am grateful that the Holy Father has chosen a joyful and energetic young bishop who speaks Spanish and Portuguese and has experience in pastoral planning,” he said in a statement. “I wish Bishop Bruce Lewandowski every blessing as he exercises his ministry in the state of hope!”
Henning was on the job for a little over a year, himself succeeding the ever outspoken Thomas Tobin in May 2023. Tobin often used social media to share his unapologetic stance opposing abortion and same-sex marriage. 
Bishop who helped reenergize the Diocese of Providence will soon head to Boston

Henning, meanwhile, tried to stay out of politics — save for using the influence of the diocese to push for a ban on assault-style weapons and vocalizing his pro-life stance.
Lewandowski has been especially vocal against mass deportations conducted by the Trump Administration, which he once compared to “an act of domestic terrorism” in 2019. His stance has not shifted since then.
“A humane enforcement of immigration laws that respects the dignity of every person is what’s in order, “ Lewandowski told reporters Monday. “Rounding up people, using fear and manipulation as a tactic to drive people away, the politics of harassment — I don’t think there’s a place for that, it doesn’t go with the way Jesus treated people.”
Pope Francis too has been critical of Trump’s immigration policies. He sent a letter to U.S. bishops on Feb. 10 saying that criminalizing undocumented immigrants and taking measures built on force “will end badly.”
The church has historically advocated for the rights and dignity of everyone, Lewandowski said.
“Every person reflects the image and likeness of God,” he said. “We’re here to protect, defend, and care for and nurture that in every single person — man, woman and child — from conception to natural death.”
‘Heaven on Earth’
Lewandowski, 57, received the news about his new job on March 29 while driving around “the wilds of Maryland.” 
He said he received a call from the apostolic nuncio to the United States asking one question: Was he alone? 
After confirming he was, Lewandowski was told he was moving to Rhode Island. 










Rounding up people, using fear and manipulation as a tactic to drive people away, the politics of harassment — I don’t think there’s a place for that, it doesn’t go with the way Jesus treated people.”


– The Most Rev. Bruce A. Lewandowski 


He said Tuesday he was still in disbelief that he was chosen to serve in “a beautiful place” such as Rhode Island. 
“I think it’s a piece of Heaven on Earth,” he said.
As he assumes the role of bishop, Lewandowski said he intends to meet people wherever they are at — especially if there’s a meal involved.
“I love to eat,” he said. “I’ve been accused of begging but I love ice cream, chocolate, cake, cookies, pies, I have a terrible sweet tooth — I’m surprised I have any teeth left.”

The House on Monday concurred with Senate amendments to House Bill 1300 but ultimately defeated the legislation. On Tuesday, the House revived the bill and instead rejected the Senate amendments, sending the bill to a conference committee.
North Dakota voters in 2022 approved a ballot measure that limits lawmakers to serving up to eight years in each chamber. It’s caused some confusion related to how it applies to lawmakers in even-numbered districts who were halfway through a term when the measure passed.
The bill, sponsored by Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, clarified that the clock starts on term limits on Nov. 7, 2022. The impact of that change would mean lawmakers in even-numbered districts elected in 2020 and reelected in 2024 could be eligible to serve up to 10 years in one chamber. Without the change, they’d only be able to serve six years.
Term limits changes revived for possible statewide vote in North Dakota

The Senate version, however, starts the clock on Jan. 1, 2023. That means lawmakers in odd-numbered districts elected in 2022 could potentially serve up to 12 years in one chamber.
The bill will now head to a conference committee made up of Senate and House members to resolve the differences between the two versions of the bill.
Separately, Senate Resolution 4008 passed both chambers of the Legislature and could be put on the 2026 general election ballot, if approved by the Secretary of State’s Office as a valid resolution. If approved by voters, the resolution would allow lawmakers to serve four terms, up to 16 years, in a single legislative chamber. It also clarifies that a partial term does not count against the limit.

(Maddie McGarvey for KFF Health News)Christopher Julian’s opioid journey is familiar to many Americans.
He was prescribed painkillers as a teenager for a series of sports injuries. He said the doctor never warned him they could be addictive. Julian didn’t learn that fact until years later, when he was cut off and began suffering withdrawal symptoms. At that point, he started siphoning pills from family members and buying them from others in his southern Maine community.
After his brother died of brain cancer in 2011, Julian used opioids to cope with more than physical pain.
He stole to support his addiction, cycled in and out of jail and treatment, and overdosed 10 times, he said. His mother once gave him CPR on their bathroom floor.
Life was “hell on Earth,” said Julian, now 43 and in long-term recovery.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Like tens of thousands of others who have suffered similarly, Julian filed claims for compensation from pharmaceutical companies accused of fueling the opioid crisis.
Earlier this year, he received his first payout: $324.58.
That’s enough to fill his car with gas about eight times or pay about a tenth of the rent for an apartment he shares with his fiancee and two children.
Meanwhile, Maine’s Cumberland County, where Julian lives, has received more than $700,000 in opioid settlement money and expects nearly $1.6 million more in the coming years, according to a newly updated database from KFF Health News. Jurisdictions throughout his state have received more than $68 million to date, and governments nationwide have raked in upward of $10 billion, the database shows.
That discrepancy between individuals’ and governments’ compensations highlights a sense of injustice felt by people directly affected by the crisis who say their suffering is the reason that governments secured these settlements.
  Susan Ousterman of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, lost her 24-year-old son, Tyler, to a drug overdose in 2020. She and other grieving family members sent a letter to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro demanding the state government use opioid settlement dollars in ways that honor the lives lost. (Steven Ousterman)
Opioid settlements with companies such as Purdue Pharma, Walmart, and Johnson & Johnson have led to headline-grabbing multibillion-dollar payouts, but most of the windfall is flowing to state and local governments, not directly to victims of the crisis.
Only a handful of companies — those that filed for bankruptcy, including Purdue Pharma, Mallinckrodt, Endo, and Rite Aid — have set aside payouts for individuals. To qualify, people must have filed claims within a certain window and provided documents proving they were prescribed painkillers from that company. Even then, many victims will receive just a few thousand dollars, lawyers and advocates estimate. Most of these companies have not started paying yet, so victims might have to wait months or years more before seeing the cash.
In contrast, state and local governments have already received settlement money. To understand the size of those payouts, KFF Health News in January downloaded data from BrownGreer, the court-appointed firm administering many national opioid settlements, and used it to update a searchable database that allows users to determine how much their city, county, or state has received or expects to receive each year.
Governments are receiving that money because attorneys general argued that their states’ public safety, health, and social service systems were harmed by the opioid crisis. Jurisdictions are supposed to spend settlement money on addiction treatment, recovery, and prevention programs. But many affected individuals and families say governments have failed to adhere to that mission.
“At the very minimum, they could spend these dollars right to prevent the future loss of life,” said Ryan Hampton, a national recovery advocate and previous co-chair of a committee in the Purdue Pharma bankruptcy case, where he represented victims. “That is the opposite of what we’ve seen to date.”
In Pennsylvania, a group of bereaved family members raised similar concerns to Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro, who finalized opioid settlements when he was attorney general.
“Instead of directing funds toward evidence-based solutions, you and your administration have allowed counties to divert these resources into law enforcement, ineffective programs, and initiatives that already have other funding streams available — disrespecting both our families and the lives lost,” they wrote in a letter dated Feb. 14. “Meanwhile, bereaved families — many of whom have lost everything — have no financial relief.”

‘Governments were way more powerful’
To be sure, many governments have spent millions of settlement dollars on treatment programs, recovery supports, distribution of overdose reversal medications, and other efforts. Some officials in charge of the money say those services, which reach many residents, can have a greater impact than individual payouts.
Will Simons, a spokesperson for the Pennsylvania governor, said in a statement that the Shapiro administration has invested nearly $90 million of settlement funds into treatment, recovery, harm reduction, and prevention initiatives, including prevention programs for youths, a drug and alcohol call center, and loan repayment programs aimed at retaining workers in the addiction treatment and recovery field.
Many of the awarded organizations “support families who have lost loved ones to this crisis, providing counseling and other family supports,” Simons said.
A few jurisdictions have created fairly modest funds directed at individuals, such as one in Boston to aid families who have lost loved ones to addiction, and a fund in Alabama for grandparents having to raise children because of parental substance use.
But nationwide, there’s little that resembles the widespread cash payments that many advocates, like Hampton, originally envisioned.
In the mid-2010s, Hampton said, he and other advocates considered filing class action lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies but realized they didn’t have the resources.
A few years later, when state attorneys general began pursuing cases against those companies, victims were thrilled, thinking they would finally get compensation alongside their governments. Hampton and other advocates held rallies, shared their stories publicly, and galvanized support for the states’ lawsuits.
In 2019, when Hampton became co-chair of the Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors in Purdue Pharma’s bankruptcy and arrived at the negotiating table with state attorneys general and other entities, he thought “everybody was there to take on the big bad pharmaceutical company and to put victims’ interests first,” he said. But as the negotiation proceeded among various creditors vying for the company’s assets, he said, “governments were way more powerful than victims and believed that they were more harmed than victims in terms of cost.”
Details of the Purdue settlement are still being finalized, and payments are unlikely to start until next year, but estimates suggest state and local governments will receive the lion’s share, while more than 100,000 victims will split a fraction of the bankruptcy payout.
Mallinckrodt, a manufacturer of generic opioids, is the only company that had begun paying victims as of early 2025, said Frank Younes, a partner at the Nebraska-based law firm High & Younes, which is representing personal injury claimants in several opioid bankruptcies.
After paying roughly 25% in administrative fees to the national trust overseeing the bankruptcy and an additional 40% in attorney fees, some of his clients have received between $400 and $700, Younes said.
He expects payouts from two other companies — Endo and Rite Aid — “will be even lower.”

But many victims won’t receive anything. Some didn’t know they could file claims until it was too late. Others struggled to obtain medical records from shuttered doctors’ offices or pharmacies that didn’t retain older documents.
Out of nearly 20,000 people who contacted Younes’ firm to participate in the various opioid bankruptcies, he said, only about 3,500 were able to file.
‘Do something for these families’
John McNerney was told his Purdue Pharma claim didn’t qualify, because he hadn’t been prescribed enough OxyContin to meet the threshold. He submitted claims for Mallinckrodt and Endo instead.
McNerney, 60, who lives in Boca Raton, Florida, said he suffered a spinal injury decades ago from a fall during a plumbing repair. For years afterward, he was prescribed various painkillers. Once his doctors cut him off, he began using pills a friend bought off the street. McNerney spent about $30,000 on rehabs before he entered long-term recovery.
Now when he sees governments spending settlement money on police cars or library books about addiction “instead of putting 100% of it into rehab,” he said, “it really bothers the heck out of me.”
“I haven’t received a nickel,” he said.
In Ohio, a group of affected families were similarly frustrated that money wasn’t reaching them or the places where they thought it was needed most.
The families teamed up with local nonprofits to submit grant applications to the OneOhio Recovery Foundation, which controls most of the state’s opioid settlement funds. They asked for several million dollars to put toward family support groups, training for family members who take in children whose parents have substance use disorders, and emergency cash aid for families to buy cribs or school supplies and cover funeral costs.
Jackie Lewis, a member of the group, said that when her 34-year-old son, Shaun, died of an overdose, she had to pay his funeral costs by credit card. She has filed a claim in the opioid bankruptcies but hasn’t received any money yet.
“Too many families didn’t have a credit card to do that with,” Lewis said. “There are families I’ve talked to that couldn’t do flowers. Some had to do a cremation instead of a traditional funeral.”
Her group did not receive funding in the first round of grants from the OneOhio Recovery Foundation.
Connie Luck, a spokesperson for the foundation, said the legal documents that established the foundation do not allow direct payments to individuals affected by the crisis. The foundation has awarded over $45 million to 245 projects throughout the state, including dozens that provide family support services like child care and rental assistance.
“We deeply empathize with those who have lost loved ones to the opioid epidemic — their pain is real, and it fuels the Foundation’s mission to end this crisis and prevent it from happening again,” Luck said in a statement.
In Maine, Julian has made peace with his $325 payout, deciding to consider it a surprise bonus rather than compensation for his years of suffering.
But he hopes governments will use their more substantial sums to provide real help — food and rental assistance for people in recovery and more treatment beds so no one has to wait six months to enter rehab as he once did.
“They’re getting millions of dollars,” said Julian, who has lost numerous close friends to overdose. “They could do something for these families that have suffered great losses.”

Methodology
For more than two years, KFF Health News has been tracking how state and local governments use — and misuse — billions of dollars in opioid settlement funds. This database marks our third update of data showing how much money state and local governments have received through national settlements with companies that made or distributed prescription painkillers.
BrownGreer, the court-appointed firm administering many national opioid settlements, tracks how much money it has delivered to various state and local governments, as well as how much is allocated to those jurisdictions for future years. It initially kept this information private.
In 2023, KFF Health News negotiated to obtain that information and made it public for the first time. Five months later, BrownGreer began posting updated versions of the information on a public website.
Last year, KFF Health News downloaded BrownGreer’s data on payouts from pharmaceutical distributors AmerisourceBergen (now called Cencora), Cardinal Health, and McKesson, as well as opioid manufacturer Janssen (now known as Johnson & Johnson Innovative Medicine), and used the state-by-state spreadsheets with separate entries for each settling company to create a searchable database.
This year, KFF Health News has updated that database with new data from BrownGreer, including payouts from opioid manufacturers Allergan and Teva, as well as CVS, Walgreens, and Walmart pharmacies.
KFF Health News downloaded data from BrownGreer’s website between Jan. 20 and 24, 2025, concerning payouts from all companies. Users can use the database to determine the total dollar amount their city, county, or state has received or expects to receive each year.
Although this is the most comprehensive data available at a national scale, it provides just a snapshot of all opioid settlement payouts. Other settlements, including with OxyContin manufacturer Purdue Pharma, are still pending. This data does not reflect additional settlements that some state and local governments have entered into beyond the national deals, such as the agreement between Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, and Ohio and regional supermarket chain Meijer. As such, this database undercounts the amount of opioid settlement money most places have received and will receive.
Payment details for some states are not available, because those states were not part of national settlement agreements, had unique settlement terms, or opted not to have their payments distributed via BrownGreer. A few examples:

West Virginia declined to join several national settlements and instead reached individual settlements with many of these companies.
Texas and Nevada were paid in full by Janssen outside the national settlement, so their payout data reflects payments only from other companies with which they entered national settlements.
Florida, Louisiana and Pennsylvania, among others, opted to receive a lump-sum payment via BrownGreer then distribute the money to localities themselves.

BrownGreer shows that several states received some of their anticipated 2027 payment from the distributors (AmerisourceBergen — now called Cencora — Cardinal Health, and McKesson) early in 2024. However, for three states — Colorado, Michigan, and Washington — BrownGreer does not provide data on how much of this prepayment went to each locality. As such, locality payments in these states may be undercounted for 2024 and overcounted for 2027.
For Oregon, BrownGreer shows 2024 payments from Walmart as fully paid in its statewide data but lists some August 2024 payments for localities as “projected.” Since the data was downloaded well past that August 2024 date, we have included those “projected” amounts in the 2024 paid total for Oregon localities. No other states had this discrepancy.

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)The Lynchburg Republican City Committee (LRCC) on Tuesday filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the Virginia Department of Elections, the State Board of Elections and Elections Commissioner Susan Beals, arguing that a 2021 law known as the “Convention Ban Law” unconstitutionally strips political parties of their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and association.
The lawsuit, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia, comes on the heels of another pending legal challenge from within Virginia’s Republican Party. On March 1, the Republican Committee of Virginia’s 6th Congressional District voted 22-1 to pursue its own litigation against the same statute, claiming it deprives political parties of their ability to control how they nominate candidates.
At the heart of both challenges is a new section in the state code, which prohibits parties from using nomination methods that exclude voters “who are otherwise eligible to participate … but are unable to attend meetings” due to certain circumstances including having a disability, temporarily living outside the state, or experiencing a contagious disease. 
The provision effectively bans long-standing party-run processes such as conventions, mass meetings, and firehouse primaries — instead mandating open, state-run primaries that do not require voter registration by political party.
“The Convention Ban Law is a direct affront to our freedom of association as a party,” said LRCC Chair Veronica Bratton. 
“Until 2024, the LRCC could choose a party-run process such as a party canvass or a convention to choose its nominee. This allowed us to keep opponents of our party from participating in helping choose our candidate, or even being that candidate.”
With the new law taking effect, the commonwealth of Virginia requires Lynchburg Republicans “to allow Democrats, or even people who ran against our nominees, to choose our nominees, or even be our nominees,” Bratton said.
Bratton cited the example of Peter Alexander, who signed a statement of intent pledging to support all Republican nominees in 2024, but then ran as a write-in candidate against GOP nominee Chris Faraldi in the general election. Alexander has since formed an exploratory committee to challenge Republican City Councilwoman Stephanie Reed in 2026. 
Under the Republican Party of Virginia’s Party Plan, Alexander’s support of an opponent disqualifies him from participating in Republican nomination contests for four years.
“The Party Plan makes our membership rules clear,” Bratton said. “The Convention Ban Law undermines those rules and puts our party’s integrity at risk.”
The legislation at issue — officially passed in 2021 and taking effect in January 2024 — was spearheaded by Del. Dan Helmer, D-Fairfax, and received bipartisan support. It was designed to ensure that absentee voters, including military personnel, students, and individuals with disabilities or medical vulnerabilities, are not excluded from participating in nominating processes.
Helmer defended the legislation Tuesday, arguing that the law was carefully crafted to protect the voting rights of Virginians who have historically faced barriers to participating in the electoral process.
“We crafted a law that is constitutional and that is all about the ability of service members, students and people with disabilities to be able to choose a representative,” Helmer said in a phone interview. He described the law as one that “promotes democracy,” adding, “I am confident that it will prevail in court.”
Helmer also pushed back on the political motivations he sees behind the lawsuit, linking the Lynchburg GOP’s challenge to a broader trend within the Republican Party, accusing them of undermining civil rights. 
“It’s no surprise with (President Donald) Trump and (Elon) Musk attacking veterans and service members that Republicans in Lynchburg are trying to undermine their civil rights as well,” he said.
However, critics say the law goes far beyond accessibility and amounts to a state takeover of party operations.
Rick Boyer, an elections attorney with Lynchburg’s Integrity Law Firm, who is representing the LRCC, said the law “forces Republicans to allow Democrats to help choose their nominees, and vice versa,” due to Virginia’s lack of party registration and the open primary system. 
“Both the U.S. and Virginia Constitutions prohibit the government from shutting down the party’s preferred speech, and from forcing it to allow its political opponents to help choose its candidates, watering down its message and weakening its chances for victory at the polls,” Boyer said.
He added that Lynchburg Republicans are confident that the Convention Ban Law is unconstitutional, and “look forward to seeing it overturned, taking power away from Richmond and returning it to local Republican activists at the grassroots level.”
The suit requests both temporary and permanent injunctive relief, asking the court to declare the law unconstitutional and to allow the LRCC to return to traditional nomination methods in time for the 2026 election cycle. With the statute already in force, all Republican nominations for 2025 have been locked in as state-run primaries, which are set for June 17.
In 2023, Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares weighed in on the law, casting doubt on the legality of firehouse primaries. 
“A political party may not select a nomination method that de facto requires covered voters to be physically present to participate or that otherwise has the practical effect of excluding their participation,” Miyares wrote in a legal opinion requested at the time by House Minority Leader Todd Gilbert, R-Shenandoah.
That opinion came amid an attempt by Lynchburg Republicans to conduct a firehouse primary for a city council race — a process that was ultimately curtailed under the looming threat of noncompliance with state law.
Still, Republican critics argue that the statute effectively nationalizes local nomination processes and disempowers grassroots organizers.
“The LRCC voted overwhelmingly to challenge the Convention Ban Law,” Bratton said. “We’re standing up for the constitutional rights of all political parties, and fighting for the grassroots of our party against the big-money Richmond interests that try to ram open primaries down the throats of the people.”
The LRCC has launched a legal defense fund to raise money for the ongoing litigation.

(Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)A criminal justice reform group held a rally at the Alabama Statehouse Tuesday urging lawmakers to pass bills overhauling parole.
About 20 supporters attended the gathering led by Alabamians for Fair Justice Coalition and the Alabama Justice Initiative urging lawmakers to pass two bills: SB 157, sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, which would permit those who are incarcerated to virtually attend their parole hearings and address the board via phone or video conference; and HB 40, sponsored by Rep. Chris England, D-Tuscaloosa, which would create new oversight of the parole board.
The state’s relatively low parole rates have long drawn criticism from criminal justice reform advocates.  The state’s parole rate was about 24% in February, according to the Bureau of Pardons and Paroles, higher than the 8% grant rate in 2023 but dramatically down from the 55% that it was in 2017.

Lawmakers have also expressed frustration with Leigh Gwathney, chair of the Parole Board.
P.J. Brown, an advocate from Montgomery who attended the event, said that she attended a parole hearing in February to speak on behalf of her son whose case was before the board. Brown said the board reviewed her son’s case along with four others in a group. All applicants in that group were denied.
“One gentleman had been there for 27 years, 27 plus, certifications, different courses he had taken to turn himself around and be one of the liaisons for other inmates coming in who just didn’t understand how to do time,” Brown said.
Veronica Johnson, interim executive director of the Alabama Justice Coalition, said they wanted “a new Parole Board.”
“We want oversight over the Parole Board,” she said. “We need accountability, and at this point, we have no accountability.”
SB 157 and HB 40 remain stalled in their chambers of origin.
SB 157 would change the current protocol, which bars parole applicants from directly addressing the Board at their hearings and instead requires them to submit written statements or have information referred to the board through interviews with personnel who prepare their materials.
The bill also states that the applicant is not permitted to interact with the victims unless they want to hear the statement.
HB 40 directs the Board of Pardons and Paroles to create guidelines on parole and release. The bill would require the Board to give reasons for deviating from the guidelines in denying parole and allows applicants to appeal the Board’s decision to the Alabama Court of Criminal Appeals should they be denied.
Similar bills to HB 40 failed for the past three years after Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee refused to support it, but it passed this year after England was able to convince enough Republicans to back the measure.
Brown said she is not against punishment, but against getting punished maliciously.
“When did the rehabilitation start?” she said. “When did the punishment end that they had to continue on to be kicked down and be shoved back into that institution.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) Utah will continue to see millions more in funds secured through litigation with companies that manufactured or sold opioids, after a new settlement was announced on Monday with the global pharmaceutical company Mylan Inc.
According to the Utah Attorney General’s Office, Mylan “deceptively marketed” its opioid products — which included fentanyl patches, oxycodone, hydrocodone and buprenorphine products — to doctors as less prone to abuse. That’s particularly the case with the fentanyl patch, the office said. 
As a result, the attorney general’s office claims doctors overprescribed Mylan’s products, which ultimately ended up on the illegal drug market. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Mylan merged with Upjohn, Pfizer’s off-patent medicine business, in 2020 to form Viatris. Its brands and products include Epipen, Viagra, Xanax and Zoloft. 
Viatris will join a growing list of pharmaceutical manufacturers, retailers, marketing companies and more — including UnitedHealth Group, Express Scripts, Purdue Pharma, Kroger, Johnson & Johnson, CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, and McKinsey & Company — that have either been sued by various attorneys general, or agreed to large settlements in the last several years. 
Utah Attorney General Derek Brown said Mylan “was aware that its opioid products, including fentanyl patches, were especially prone to abuse, and did not inform consumers of that issue.”
Split among 15 states, including Utah, Viatris will pay about $335 million over the next nine years, money that will go toward law enforcement training and equipment, recovery programs and harm reduction efforts, including purchasing the overdose-reversing drug naloxone. 
Fentanyl is the most common drug found in overdose deaths in Utah

Attorneys general from California, Illinois, Massachusetts, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Tennessee, and Virginia negotiated alongside Brown for the settlement, while coordinating with Colorado, Delaware, Georgia, Idaho, Iowa, and Vermont. 
Those annual payments will vary between $27.5 and $40 million each, and will be allocated based on each state’s “level of participation in the settlement,” according to a statement from Viatris. 
In the statement, Viatris said its presence in the U.S. opioid market is “very small,” and that the settlement “is in no way an admission of wrongdoing or liability.” 
Viatris said it will “further focus on its mission of empowering people worldwide to live healthier at every stage of life, advance its efforts to address unmet patient needs through an expanded innovative portfolio and continue to serve approximately 1 billion patients annually with its diverse portfolio of medicines.” 
The company pointed to its manufacturing of a generic, injectible version of naloxone, and other generic buprenorphine and naloxone products used for opioid treatment and recovery. 
The Viatris settlement will add to the roughly $81 million secured by Utah so far from opioid settlements. According to legislative budget records, Utah expects to see nearly $495 million from opioid settlements over the next 17 years — about  $248.7 million will go to the state government, and $242.3 million will be dished out to counties. 
The largest settlement is from the “Big 3 Distributors,” according to state records, which are Cardinal, McKesson, and Amerisource Bergen — industry giants that, according to The New York Times, distribute about 90% of the country’s drug and medical supplies. That settlement amounts to more than $219 million that will flow to the state and counties over the next 17 years.

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch)This story first appeared on the Utah News Dispatch. 
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he’s proud of Utah’s push to eliminate fluoride from drinking water, telling reporters he hopes other states follow suit.
Kennedy spoke to a crowded room of journalists, lawmakers and health officials on Monday, part of a tour of Western states to promote his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, known as MAHA.
“If we want to be a moral nation, if we want to maintain our moral authority around the world, our chief obligation is to our children. And we’re letting them down. And I’m very, very happy that Utah is taking the lead in so many ways,” Kennedy said on Monday. “It makes no sense to have fluoride in our water. The evidence against fluoride is overwhelming … we know that it causes I.Q. loss.”
Utah becomes the first state to ban adding fluoride to drinking water

Fluoride is a mineral that has been shown to strengthen teeth by replacing minerals that are lost from acid breakdown, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A recent report from the National Toxicology Program found that high levels of fluoride in drinking water can be associated with a lower I.Q. in children — but according to the report, those levels are twice as high as the current recommended amount of fluoride.
Kennedy spoke to several bills that align with the MAHA agenda, mostly focusing on HB81, the fluoride bill. Sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, the bill prohibits municipalities from adding fluoride to drinking water, while adding it to the list of drugs that pharmacists can prescribe.
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz said that’s a “win-win” situation.
“We want to make sure those options are there” for Utahns who want more fluoride than what’s available in toothpaste or mouthwash, said Schultz, R-Hooper, who spoke during Monday’s news conference.
The bill received pushback from dentists and other health professionals, who say adding fluoride to drinking water has resulted in less cavities among children. That includes Dr. Sarah Woolsey, a family physician who told lawmakers during a legislative committee meeting that she saw a decrease in referrals for cavity extractions under anesthesia after Salt Lake County started to add fluoride to its water.
“Despite my efforts in education, in prescribing fluoride and working with parents, the voluntary application does not always work for those that may be most vulnerable,” said Woolsey. “And I would like to say that since fluoride has been in the water, the number of kids I send (to have teeth extracted) is significantly less.”
The bill passed mostly along party lines, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. It was signed by the governor on March 27, and takes effect on May 7.
After the news conference on Monday, Kennedy told the Associated Press he will instruct the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending state and local governments add fluoride to drinking water. He also told the Associated Press he will set up a task force to look into the issue.
Lee Zeldin, a former GOP congressman and the current head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the agency is going to review all the fluoride-related studies that came out since the National Toxicology Program report in 2024.

“We’re prepared to act based on this science,” said Zeldin, who also spoke during the event on Monday. “Both the National Toxicology Program study, as well as other peer-reviewed studies. If this is as important as it is to Secretary Kennedy, if it’s important as it is, clearly to so many people who are here in this room and at this news conference today, then it is top of the list for the Environmental Protection Agency.”
Kennedy suggested Gricius’ bill could be a model for other states.
“I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban (fluoride). I hope many more will come,” he said on Monday, echoing the argument from Utah lawmakers this session — that it’s an issue of bodily autonomy and freedom of choice.
“We shouldn’t be demanding that parents accept something in their children and homes that is essentially a medication. They can go to a drug store and get toothpaste,” Kennedy said. “I think it’s a moral imperative that we all believe in freedom of choice in this country, it’s one of the bedrock principles of our democracy.”
Kennedy also touted two other bills passed by the legislature and signed by the governor.
HB402, sponsored by Rep. Kristen Chevrier, R-Highland, bans public schools from using certain food dyes and other preservatives and additives — including potassium bromate and propylparaben — in food preparation.
And HB403, also sponsored by Chevrier, restricts Utahns who receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — a federal program that subsidizes food purchases for low-income individuals — from buying soda.
“We anticipate that this is the beginning of a cultural shift that will extend throughout the nation, a shift towards proactively building health rather than treating disease,” said Chevrier during the news conference Monday.
Kennedy, former presidential candidate, environmental attorney, son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former president John F. Kennedy, was nominated to lead the country’s Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump.
Kennedy has long promoted public health reform, healthy diets and alternative treatments to chronic diseases — some of his stances have been controversial, including skepticism around certain vaccines, advocating against fluoride in drinking water, and claims that COVID-19 impacts certain ethnic groups differently.

House Bill 427, “CCW Permit/No Records Provided,” pertains to the mental health of an applicant for a concealed handgun permit — the latest in a number of measures aiming to alter the regulation of guns and concealed carry. Its primary sponsors are Reps. Keith Kidwell (R-Beaufort, Dare, Hyde, Pamlico), Ben Moss (R-Moore, Richmond), Joseph Pike (R-Harnett), and Bill Ward (R-Camden, Gates, Hertford, Pasquotank).
At the moment, North Carolina law requires the disclosure of records concerning the mental health or capacity of applicants for concealed handgun permits. This bill would modify the law to ask for a “yes” or “no” statement indicating whether the applicant has been diagnosed by a medical professional with a mental illness.
In explaining the bill, Kidwell said the release of medical records for background checks when applying for a concealed weapon permit are meant to be used only to look at a person’s mental capacity. Instead, he said, there have been situations across the state in which additional non-mental health information has been released — for example, if a person had had a vasectomy or if they’ve had their tonsils removed.
“What this seeks to do is to put it in a situation where only the mental health piece of it would be what’s checked on to verify that somebody can legally get a concealed carry permit,” Kidwell said.
The panel also approved a technical amendment from Rep. Charles Smith (D-Cumberland) to provide additional privacy to the applicant and medical personnel.
Allowing a variety of concealed knives
The other piece of legislation, House Bill 439, “Allow Concealed Carry of Knife,” does as its title suggests. Kidwell, Pike, and Ward serve as the bill’s primary sponsors.
Current law allows people to carry concealed pocketknives.
Under HB 439, individuals above 18 years of age who are carrying identification and have not been convicted of a felony may carry a knife as described: a bowie knife, a dirk, a dagger, or a switchblade.
“I think most gentlemen and many women carry concealed blades, and this is just going to make it a situation where you’re not going to be arrested for doing so,” Kidwell said.
He accepted an amendment from Smith to add additional language prohibiting knives in places where concealed handguns may not be carried.
“I think this bill is putting knives on the same level as firearms,” Smith said. “My hope is to make that really consistent and just have sort of corresponding language.”
Rep. Deb Butler (D-New Hanover) said she approved of the amendment, since it attempts to create parity between a firearm and a knife.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/GunsNJ-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 16:05:33.573036

Thom Tillis of North Carolina.Greer told members of the Senate Committee on Finance that President Donald Trump’s national emergency declaration to trigger steep worldwide import taxes is “common sense.”“Our trade deficit, driven by these non-reciprocal conditions, is a manifestation of the loss of the nation’s ability to make, to grow, and to build,” Greer said.“The president recognizes the urgency of the moment. On the first day of his second term, President Trump issued a comprehensive memorandum setting out his trade policy direction. No other president has done this,” Greer continued in his opening statement.Responses from around the world range from all-out retaliation to negotiation to capitulation. Chinese officials, who could see tariffs reach 104% after Trump threatened Monday to pile more on, said Tuesday they will “fight to the end.”Tariffs launch just after midnightThe previously scheduled hearing on Trump’s trade agenda came less than a week after the president used his emergency powers to unveil new import taxes on products from nearly every country around the world.Trump’s tariffs will begin just after midnight, hitting major exporters to the United States as well as poor and developing nations. They range from a 46% tax on Vietnam, whose major exports to Americans include tech products, to a 50% tax on Lesotho, a small African nation that exports diamonds to U.S. jewelers.Claims from the administration that dozens of governments have reached out to negotiate buoyed U.S. and world markets Tuesday after three days of turbulence erased trillions of dollars in wealth.Trump’s baseline 10% tariffs launched Saturday on trading partners, including allies who import more American goods than the amount of their own products they export to the U.S.The tax on allies with a trade surplus drew the ire of Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat. “Why did they get whacked in the first place?” he asked Greer, raising his voice.Trump has exempted pharmaceuticals, oil and gas, critical minerals, and semiconductors from his new levies. Those imports are worth $665 billion, according to an analysis from the Atlantic Council, a think tank focused on U.S. foreign relations.The levies come on top of Trump’s previously enacted 25% national security levies on foreign steel and aluminum, and foreign cars, as well as emergency tariffs at 20% on Chinese imports and 10% to 25% on products from Canada and Mexico. ‘Aimless, chaotic tariff spree’Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the committee, announced at the hearing that he plans to fast-track a resolution “to end the latest crop of global tariffs that are clobbering American families and business members on both sides of the aisle.”“Donald Trump’s aimless, chaotic tariff spree has proven beyond a doubt that Congress has given far too much of its constitutional power over international trade to the executive branch. It is time to take that power back,” the Oregon Democrat said in opening remarks.Committee Chair Mike Crapo expressed some optimism that Trump’s tariff agenda would eventually boost American industries.“Members and the public have questions and concerns about the recent tariff actions. That’s ok. We should think about tariff impacts and ask questions,” said Crapo, an Idaho Republican.Once people “contextualize” Trump’s tariffs, “the real headline then becomes the fundamental shift in trade policy since President Trump’s inauguration — where the United States actually plans to do trade again,” Crapo said.Oklahomans worriedBut other senators wanted more assurance for small business owners who are contacting them for answers about the sudden economic turmoil.Sen. James Lankford told Greer he’s heard from a constituent in Oklahoma who switched purchasing from China to Vietnam after Trump’s first administration targeted China with tariffs. Now, the company worries about the 46% tax it will have to pay on imports from Vietnam.“Is there a timeline you’re dealing with?” the Republican asked Greer.The trade representative said more than 50 countries, including Vietnam, have reached out to strike new trade agreements.“We don’t have any particular timeline set on that,” Greer said. “What I can say is I’m moving as quickly as possible.”“The time piece does matter to them,” Lankford said.Lankford then asked if any industries, including garment manufacturers in Oklahoma, can apply for an exemption from import taxes on products they can only purchase from abroad.“I know long term the hope is to have a more diversified (market). In the short term, they don’t have another option. How do you plan to handle that?” Lankford said.Greer replied: “Senator, the president has been clear with me and with others that he doesn’t intend to have exclusions and exemptions, especially given the nature of the action. If you have Swiss cheese in the action, it can undermine the overall point.”Warner grew heated during questioning with Greer, saying he’s hearing from Wall Street that business people viewed the U.S. market recovery Tuesday “as a good day in hospice.”“We have 800,000 small businesses in Virginia. These tariffs are going to wallop them,” Warner said.EU, other nations reactThe European Union is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a list of targeted American imports the bloc of 27 nations plans to tax in response. Trump unveiled a 20% levy on EU products as part of his “Liberation Day” plans.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is staring down a 17% tariff from Trump, promised during an Oval Office meeting Monday that his country will “very quickly” even out trade with the U.S.Trump wrote on social media Tuesday morning that he held a “great call” with South Korea’s acting president Han Duck-soo. Trump imposed a 25% tariff on South Korean exports into the U.S., which largely include cars, auto parts and electric batteries.“Their top TEAM is on a plane heading to the U.S., and things are looking good,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform.The comments came a day Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he would lead negotiations with Japan, which faces a 24% levy. Americans mainly import cars, auto parts and construction vehicles from Japan.The prospect of negotiation brought Japan’s stocks up overnight after flagging upon tariff uncertainty.",,,,2025-04-08 16:05:33.573036

(Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)Hours after the close of the 2025 session, Gov. Wes Moore (D) and legislative leaders signed dozens of bills — many focused on work force and employment issues — into law.
The tranche of 92 bills — including two of the governor’s priorities — came in the first of five such ceremonies scheduled between now and the end of May. Many of the bills signed Tuesday centered around a top area of focus for the governor this year.
“Maryland is mobilizing in support of our workers and in support of our middle-class families,” Moore said in brief opening remarks.
He highlighted Senate Bill 431, which he said incentivizes companies to create apprenticeships.
“This legislation will strengthen the apprenticeship pipeline in the state of Maryland,” Moore said. “Because while we are proud of the fact that Maryland is some of the best four-year institutions of higher education in the entire country, we will end this myth that every single one of our students need to attend one in order to be economically successful.”
Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) praised the bill and the creation of the Office of Registered Apprenticeship Development as “a critical component of the Department of Labor.” The office will be created within the state Department of Labor’s apprenticeship and training program.
House Bill 502, another Moore priority, creates the Office of Disability Employment Advancement and Policy.

“This bill extends a hand to a community that has been left behind for far too long when it comes to employment — Marylanders with disabilities,” Moore said.
The bill was one of those celebrated as a win by advocates for services for the developmentally disabled.
“This year’s successes mark a turning point for disability services and rights in Maryland,” said Ande Kolp, executive director of The Arc Maryland. “The DD Coalition remains committed to building a more inclusive, equitable, and sustainable future where all people with developmental disabilities can live with dignity, independence and full community participation.”
Half of all Marylanders with disabilities face financial hardships. Marylanders with disabilities make up just 5% of the workforce, according to Moore.
The bill also establishes a “model employer initiative” in which the office will focus on facilitating the hiring of candidates who have disabilities.
“If we want to unleash Maryland’s potential, we need pathways to work, wages and wealth for all members, and not just some,” Moore said.
Moore also signed identical House and Senate bills that will create a fast track for some health care professionals to be licensed in Maryland.
“We are talking about highly qualified, highly skilled workers who have built careers saving lives,” Moore said. “People who have committed their lives to serving the lives of others, and now they are being told by someone who was never willing to take the same oath that they took, that their service doesn’t matter. Well, in Maryland, we believe their service does matter, and this legislation will help ensure essential workers can continue their work to be able to make our state better.”
The new law, which takes effect July 1, applies to health care professionals who hold licenses that have an equivalent in Maryland and who left their federal jobs after Jan. 20 of this year.
The next bill signing is set for April 22.
About last night
Moore, in remarks before the bill signing, praised House and Senate leaders for working collaboratively. He repeated his top three goals for the session including reforming the tax code, making the state economy less dependent on the federal government and taking steps to “invest in our people, invest in our work.”
“Meeting these goals required all of us to work together,” Moore said Tuesday morning.
Ten hours earlier, in a statement released moments after the 90-day session ended, Moore expressed disappointment that some of his priorities failed to gain traction this year. Moore, in his statement, lamented the opportunities missed by the General Assembly on issues related to affordable housing, attracting businesses to the state, and adding nuclear to a clean energy plan that could result in lower rates.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)A new state regulation allows people to harvest certain wild animals killed by cars on the road.
A new Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) rule that took effect March 25 allows motorists to collect animals killed in vehicular accidents as long as they apply for a retroactive permit within 24 hours. One permit applies to one animal.  
Carcasses of animals permitted for salvage are whitetailed deer, turkeys, beavers, coyotes, muskrats, pheasants, squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, woodchucks and mute swans. 
Red and gray foxes and fishercats can also be harvested, but salvagers need to contact the DEM’s Department of Fish and Wildlife within a week. DEM may collect bones or teeth from foxes and fishercats for analysis, as part of broader trapping regulations and research into wildlife populations.    
The new regulation derives from 2024 legislation introduced by Rep. David Bennett and Sen. David Tikoian in their respective chambers. The new rule, according to the DEM, is designed to “make use of an underutilized resource and eases the burden on state staff removing carcasses.”


How to get a permit
Motorists need to submit the following information online, or via phone at (401) 789-0281 within 24 hours of collection:

Species
Estimated age and sex
Photo
Location 



The DEM expects motorists to observe traffic laws when collecting roadkill specimens. If the animal is field dressed on the side of the road, motorists are prohibited from leaving behind the animal’s internal organs because it can attract more wildlife to the road. 
Collectors can’t attach hunting tags to the carcasses, and injured animals cannot be killed for salvage unless law enforcement approves otherwise, the DEM rule states.
Meat from roadkill can only be consumed, and not sold, donated or used as bait. Any unused parts need to be properly and legally disposed of.
Deer can make for particularly harmful and expensive collisions, the DEM noted, and the department received 1,347 reports of deer collisions last year. On average, these collisions cost about $6,717 in damages, according to the Federal Highway Administration.

So far this year, the state has had 56 cases, all but three in Lea County, with two in Eddy County. The new case in Chavez is one of two new cases since the state’s Friday report.
“A new case in a new county – and cases in now 22 U.S. states – is a reminder that measles is a highly contagious virus,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “It also underscores how the measles, mumps, rubella (MMR) vaccine is the best way to prevent measles.”
New Mexico’s measles cases are believed to have originated in nearby Gaines County, Texas. The Texas Department of Health on Tuesday said its cases have now topped 500 and spread to 10 counties.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, whose response to the outbreak has been criticized by New Mexico’s federal delegation, over the weekend met with the families of children in Texas who died from measles, and subsequently posted a social media post in which he endorsed the MMR vaccine as the most effective way to stop the spread. The post from Kennedy, who founded the anti-vaccine nonprofit Children’s Health Defense, angered some vaccine skeptics, NPR reported. Kennedy is also visiting Utah, Arizona and New Mexico this week, but HHS has not disclosed his New Mexico itinerary.
New Mexico’s vaccination rates both statewide and in the impacted area have increased. According to DOH, between Feb. 1 and April 3, 3,269 southeast New Mexico residents received the MMR vaccine – more than double the the number administered in the region during the same period last year. Statewide, between Feb. 1 and April 3, 16,455 New Mexicans have received the vaccine compared to 8,842 last year. Officials say one dose of the MMR vaccine, which provides lifetime protection, is 93% effective; two doses are 97% effective.
The state has numerous public offices offering daily walk-in vaccinations, including at the Chaves County Public Health Office in Roswell.



Symptoms
A person with measles can infect others from four days before rash onset through four days after the rash appears. Symptoms begin with a cough, runny nose and eye redness that progresses to fever and rash. The rash starts on the head before spreading to the whole body.
People experiencing fever and rash should contact their doctors or emergency departments in advance so they can prepare for a visit by someone who might have measles. Nurses staff the NMDOH Helpline at 1-833-SWNURSE (1-833-796-8773), and can provide information in English and Spanish related to measles and vaccination questions.
Find more information from the health department’s measles guidance page, including a complete list of walk-in and scheduled vaccination clinics across New Mexico.

(Photo by Laina G. Stebbins/Michigan Advance)The Republican attorneys general for Iowa and South Carolina are leading a coalition of 11 states in seeking to overturn Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy for minors.
Contending that the law censors therapists’ speech, the coalition filed a brief Friday in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting a reversal of a decision issued in January by U.S. District Judge Jane Beckering.
Beckering, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, found the Michigan law does not govern free expression of religion or speech, but instead professional conduct, which she said the state has a “legitimate interest” in regulating.
Passed in 2023 by Michigan’s then Democratic-led Legislature, the law prohibits mental health professionals from seeking to alter a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity, a practice known as conversion therapy, or risk facing disciplinary action that could result in the loss of their professional licenses.
However, the group of Republican attorneys general says the ruling sets up a “censorship regime” that forces mental health professionals to “choose between making a living in a licensed profession and retaining their right to speak freely.”
The case stems from a lawsuit filed in July 2024 by Catholic Charities of Jackson, Lenawee and Hillsdale counties on behalf of Emily McJones, a licensed therapist from Lansing. Her practice, Little Flower Counseling, provides “evidenced-based treatments from a perspective that is faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church, while loving and caring for each client.”
However, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has determined that not only do conversion therapies “lack scientific credibility and clinical utility,” there is “evidence that such interventions are harmful.” That stance is shared by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as the American Psychological Association and the National Association of School Psychologists.
Regardless, the Republican attorneys general argue Michigan’s ban risks tainting medicine with politics.
In addition to the attorneys general in Iowa and South Carolina, the brief is signed on by AGs in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, and North Dakota.
“Free speech should protect the medical field from political pressure seeking to stifle scientific advancements. And it is far from clear that the ideological partisan bent embodied in Michigan’s law is ‘settled’ in any meaningful sense,” the brief said.
A similar law in Colorado is set to be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court later this fall.
While the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld the Colorado law, two similar ordinances in Florida were struck down in November 2020 by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals as an unconstitutional violation of therapists’ free-speech rights.
In South Carolina, the city of Columbia passed a similar ban in June 2021, which threatens to fine counselors or therapists working in the state’s capital $500 per violation. It is the only such ordinance in the state.
In 2022, Wilson’s office penned a nonbinding opinion concluding that the Columbia ban would likely be struck down if challenged. South Carolina is in the 4th Circuit, so neither of the conflicting previous rulings affected Columbia’s ban.
However, wrote Solicitor General Robert Cook in February 2022, “we believe a court is likely to hold that the Columbia ordinance is invalid as suppressing free speech and also that the ordinance is an effort to exercise powers which a municipality does not possess.
“While we appreciate and respect the efforts of the city of Columbia in protecting equal dignity for all persons, the city cannot adopt an ordinance that likely violates the state and federal constitutions,” he wrote in wrapping up the opinion requested by a GOP senator.
A South Carolina law passed later that year barred local governments from passing ordinances that restrict or limit health care services provided by any medical practitioner, which includes doctors, counselors and social workers. Only the state can license and regulate those fields, the law says.
However, Columbia’s ban has never been challenged in court.

Phil Murphy has granted 129 clemency requests since last June — the most of all governors, combined, in the past 30 years.","Gov. Phil Murphy signing one of a handful of pardons he approved in New Brunswick on April 8, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the governor's office)Gov. Phil Murphy issued pardons to 87 people and shortened the sentences of six more in his second round of clemency actions Tuesday, making history for granting more clemencies than New Jersey governors have in the past three decades combined.
With 36 clemencies signed in December, Murphy now has pardoned or commuted the sentences of 129 people since he created a clemency advisory board last June.
“Altogether, it’s staggering. When you think about this, I will be commuting more than 100 years of prison time,” Murphy said at Rutgers University, where he announced the clemencies. “That means a century of family get-togethers, holidays and memories. It means parents being reunited with their children and lives being changed in a fundamental level for the better.”
Justin Dews heads the clemency advisory board, which recommends mercy for people who fit certain categories, such as non-violent offenders who have stayed out of trouble for at least a decade and people serving excessive sentences or who committed their crimes because they were victims of domestic abuse, sexual violence, or sex trafficking.
Dews called 129 clemencies in less than a year “remarkable” and urged the gubernatorial candidates now running to replace Murphy, a term-limited Democrat, to pick up his clemency crusade. Murphy leaves office in January after serving two terms.

“I want to speak directly to the candidates on both sides of the aisle. This an effort worth continuing. Clemency doesn’t have a partisan affiliation,” Dews said. “It’s incumbent on the future leader of our state to grapple with what it means to judiciously and fairly use his or her clemency authority, a power that, if elected, would be their sole discretion. There is no check. There is no balance. It’s just you.”
Murphy promised another two or three rounds of clemency in the nine months before his term ends. He encouraged anyone seeking mercy to file clemency petitions by June, if possible, to give the advisory board enough time to weigh their applications. Murphy has received more than 3,000 requests for clemency since he took office in 2018, including 2,200 since the advisory board formed last summer.
Those pardoned Tuesday had criminal histories for all sorts of offenses, from robbery to arson to shoplifting, but a majority had records peppered with drug offenses. New Jersey has moved in recent years to decriminalize some drug offenses, recognizing that drug arrests have historically disproportionately impacted communities of color and can stem from addiction.
Murphy also commuted the sentences of five people now incarcerated for murder, including Jamal Muhammad, who has been behind bars for more than 28 years. Muhammad was sentenced to life in prison with 30 years of parole ineligibility for a 1996 robbery in Atlantic City that turned deadly when his co-defendant shot the victim.
“Over the years, Jamal has taken responsibility for his actions, and while serving his time, he has undergone a remarkable transformation,” Murphy said. “He discovered a passion for ethics and religious studies. He discovered a passion for writing a book based on anti-bullying so he could do his part to build a gentler and more compassionate world.”
Muhammad’s sister, Islah, cried as she thanked Murphy and said her family looks forward to her brother’s homecoming.
“This 27-year-long prayer, which began in the hearts of our deceased parents, has been answered, and we are eternally grateful to God for this profound and long-awaited opportunity,” she said.
Man’s fight for exoneration in 1981 murder case reveals systemic failures, lawyer says

Besides Muhammad, Murphy also commuted the sentences of:

Rashon Barkley, who was sentenced to life behind bars plus 50 years for four robberies in 1993 in Newark, East Orange, and Irvington that left one person dead.
Paige Pfefferle, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for stabbing her boyfriend to death during a 2010 argument in Audubon Park.
Alberto Salazar, who was sentenced in 2003 to 30 years in prison for an Elizabeth robbery in which the victim, 88, died after she fell to the floor. He will be deported after he’s released from prison due to his immigration status, Murphy’s office said.
Michelle Tierney, who was sentenced to 30 years in prison for killing her live-in boyfriend during a 1998 fight outside their Middlesex County home. The couple had a history of domestic violence.

Murphy signed several clemency actions Tuesday surrounded by the people he helped, including Racha Barlow, who had drug and weapon convictions dating back to 1991.
“Oh governor, I love you!” she said, as he prepared to scribble his name on her pardon.
Barlow, who works as a reentry coordinator for the City of Trenton, has become an author, poet, and screenwriter since she left prison.
“Today, I officially retire my state number 14489,” Barlow said as her family cheered nearby. “From this day forward, I will never again be told what I cannot do.”

Brad Little gives his annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, on the House floor at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Less than an hour after the Idaho Legislature passed its final bill of the year on Friday — the so-called medical freedom act — Gov. Brad Little already signed it into law. 
The new broad medical mandate ban bill, Senate Bill 1210, will bar Idaho businesses, government entities, schools and colleges from restricting entry, employment or services based on requirements for medical interventions — like vaccines, medical diagnosis or treatment.
Little vetoed an earlier version of the bill, saying he worried the original bill “jeopardizes” schools’ ability to send home sick kids. The tweaked bill he later signed carves out an exception for that.
Idaho’s new medical requirement ban law takes effect July 1.
The Legislature adjourned for the year Friday afternoon.
But as Idaho’s governor, Little still has to decide what to do with more than a dozen bills on his desk — at least as of Monday night. 
During the legislative session, Little only has five days to decide on bills. But once the Legislature adjourns for the year, Little has a 10-day deadline on bill actions. 
Little has not yet taken action on at least two health bills, including House Bill 109, that will require Idaho to seek federal approval to stop covering candy and soda in the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
A bill that would make ivermectin available in Idaho over-the-counter, without a prescription or health care provider consultation, Senate Bill 1211, still awaits the governor’s action. The drug, normally used to treat parasites, gained fame during the pandemic after false claims that it was effective in treating COVID-19.
The governor has three options on bills: sign them into law, allow them to become law without his signature, or veto them.

It would increase the out of pocket costs for LSU and University of New Orleans students.  Currently, the state sets the TOPS award amount that each university receives. House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, [&#8230;]","A photo of Keeny Hall at Louisiana Tech University from September 2016. (Creative Commons license)The Louisiana Legislature will consider creating a flat rate for TOPS program scholarships, regardless of what school students attend. It would increase the out of pocket costs for LSU and University of New Orleans students. 
Currently, the state sets the TOPS award amount that each university receives. House Bill 77 by Rep. Chris Turner, R-Ruston, would decouple those rates from university tuition, meaning students would have to pay more out of pocket to attend more expensive universities but pay less at regional universities such as Nicholls and McNeese. It would create a significant decrease in revenue for LSU and UNO. 
Turner’s bill would also create a new award level that would provide additional money to students who earn at least a 3.5 grade point average and a 31 out of 36 on the ACT college admissions test. 
If Turner’s bill passes, the base-level amount, which approximately half of Louisiana TOPS students receive, would be $6,000 annually, TOPS Performance students, who have at least a 3.25 GPA and a 23 ACT score, would receive $6,500. TOPS Honors students, who have at least a 3.5 GPA and a 27 ACT score, would receive $9,000. The bill’s proposed TOPS Excellence award, the new highest amount, would be $12,000. 
Because the current base TOPS level is above $6,500 at LSU and UNO, both institutions could lose millions in state funding under Turner’s plan, while most other schools in the state would see a boost. LSU’s nursing programs would also see a funding loss under the bill.

Turner said he and coauthor, House Education Chairwoman Rep. Laurie Schlegel, R-Metairie, worked with some of the state’s universities and the Board of Regents on the bill, which he said was intended to create fairness between the universities and to help keep high-performing students in the state. 
“It wasn’t fair to give this university more and not the other one,” Turner said in an interview.  “All the institutions would be treated equally.” 
The Taylor Opportunity Program for Students, more commonly known as TOPS, is a merit-based scholarship program that helps Louisiana students attend in-state schools. 
Turner said he believed the bill would hurt LSU on the lower end, but that it would make up its loss through the new Excellence award amount. But LSU’s main campus has nearly 10,000 students who would lose TOPS funding under the bill and only a small number of students who would qualify for Excellence. 
Any potential loss in funding would hit UNO particularly hard as it grapples with a budget crisis and looks to cut millions from its budget. 
Students currently enrolled at LSU and UNO would begin to pay more out of pocket for the fall semester if the bill passes in its current form. The proposal is expected to face staunch opposition, because of its impact on LSU and UNO and an overall cost increase for TOPS. 
Gov. Jeff Landry has pushed for a standstill budget after voters rejected Amendment 2 in the March 29 election. It would have moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund for lawmakers to spend. 
For some schools with lower tuition and fees, the new award amounts would create an excess for students. Under present law, that money would be applied to students’ room and board expenses, which typically are paid out of pocket. But under a new law the legislature approved last year, schools have complete autonomy to raise their fees, meaning they could increase the cost of attendance to meet the new award amount — and increase their revenues.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)A Florida House committee on Tuesday passed a resolution (HJR 679) that would place a constitutional amendment on the 2026 ballot asking voters to impose eight-year term limits on county commissioners and school board members. 
But its Senate companion bill has stalled, raising doubt about whether the Legislature will approve the limits during this year’s legislative session. 
Twelve counties in Florida have already imposed term limits on their county commissioners. Eight such counties have imposed term limits of eight years, while four others have imposed 12-year term limits, with Pinellas the latest to do so last fall.
Panhandle Republican Michelle Salzman’s resolution would allow county commissioners who want to run for county mayor to do so immediately, and not have to take any time off from public service before running for that office. Orange, Palm Beach and Miami-Dade are among the counties in Florida that have such a county mayor position.
The proposal is fiercely opposed by the Florida Association of Counties.
Jeff Scala, director of public policy with that group, complained the resolution would strip voters of their ability to self govern by forcing them to vote on county commission term limits statewide, “imposing their choices on other voters.”
If the proposal goes on the 2026 ballot, voters in the 12 counties that have already changed their charters to impose term limits, who represent 58% of the state, could impose their preferences on the rest of the state.
“Miami-Dade voters deciding for Monroe County,” he said. “What is best for St. Lucie [County]. We have a situation where Orange County voters go back to tell Marion or Lake County voters that eight years is the right number.” 
Rich Templin of the Florida AFL-CIO agreed, telling lawmakers that the proposal, if approved, would take away local control.
“You are going to be allowing three or four counties around the state to make a decision about foundational governance for local communities that will have no say,” he said, adding that the more populous counties will outvote small ones.
The only Republican member of the House State Affairs Committee to oppose the measure was Tampa Rep. Karen Gonzalez-Pittman. She said the proposal would be weak unless it included term limits for staff.
“We’ve seen what has happened when we’ve had term limits and not having term limits on staff. It has made staff much more powerful, and we’re seeing that in the Legislature as well as in D.C., where the current administration is trying to undo that,” she said.
Public support
In response, Salzman emphasized that public opinion polls have consistently showed that more than 80% of the country supports term limits. (A Pew Research Center survey from September 2023 showed that 87% of the public want term limits for members of Congress).
She said she had responded to criticism about a similar proposal she carried last year, which wouldn’t have given voters any say on the matter. So this year’s proposal is a resolution and not a bill, meaning that if it wins 3/5ths support in both chambers of the Legislature, it would be placed on the statewide ballot next year, giving the voters the option of deciding the issue.
Salzman dismissed criticism that certain counties would have more sway in a statewide election.
“We’re trying to give the voters what they want and we’re over here arguing about whose voice is louder,” she said. 
The Senate version (SJR 802), sponsored by West Central Florida Republican Blaise Ingoglia, has passed one committee but has two more stops before reaching the floor.
In 1992, Florida voters approved an amendment to the state’s Constitution creating eight-year term limits for legislators. Eight years later, 68 term-limited senators and representatives were forced to retire, and the state saw the highest number of freshman legislators since the first legislative session in 1845, according to the book “The Failure of Term Limits in Florida,”  by Florida International University professor Kathryn A. Depalo.

Universities of Wisconsin spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that there have also been cancellations at other UW campuses and the system is working on gathering more information. “We are [&#8230;]","Bascom Hall, University of Wisconsin-Madison. (Ron Cogswell | used by permission of the photographer)President Donald Trump’s administration canceled the visas of six current University of Wisconsin-Madison students and seven alumni who had employment extensions, the university announced. Universities of Wisconsin spokesperson Mark Pitsch said in an email that there have also been cancellations at other UW campuses and the system is working on gathering more information.
“We are aware of visa terminations other than those described at UW-Madison. Resources for students are available through our universities,” Pitsch wrote.
The cancellations come as the Trump administration has been cracking down on immigration, including the presence of international students in the country.
UW-Madison said in a press release Monday that it played no role in the cancellations. According to the release, UW learned from the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) that the students’ records were terminated. 
According to the Wisconsin State Journal, UW-Madison Chancellor Jennifer Mnookin told the Faculty Senate that it wasn’t contacted directly about the cancellations and only learned about them because staff has been reviewing federal databases every day to see whether students have been affected.
UW-Madison noted that a status termination generally means an affected person should depart the United States immediately. UW-Madison’s office responsible for providing services to international students has contacted the students and alumni whose visas were canceled to advise them about the potential consequences of the cancellations and provide information about legal resources if requested. 
UW-Madison also said that while it’s not uncommon to see terminations for many reasons, it and peer institutions have seen an elevated volume and frequency of terminations over the last week. 
On March 28, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said that at least 300 visas for international students have been revoked. Rubio told reporters that every time he finds “one of these lunatics,” referring to students that have participated in protests, he takes away their visa.
The cancellations have taken place at other institutions in the Midwest including University of Michigan, University of Minnesota, Minnesota State University in Mankato as well as other institutions across the country, including at University of California institutions, Colorado State University and Arizona State University. In some cases, the cancellations have been tied to activism related to Palestine, while others have been tied to criminal infractions and in some cases, traffic violations. 
UW-Madison said the “precise rationale” for the termination of the visas is unclear, but that it doesn’t believe they were specific to participation in any “free speech events or political activity.” The university hasn’t responded to an inquiry for more information about the students. 
Some of the students targeted by the Trump administration have been outspoken activists against the war in Gaza. Mahmoud Khalil, a former student at Columbia University who helped lead pro-Palestinian protests on campus, was detained by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and is being held in a Louisiana detention facility with federal authorities claiming to have revoked his green card. Tufts doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish citizen with an F-1 student visa, was detained by mask-wearing DHS agents as she was leaving her off-campus apartment in Massachusetts. She is also being held in Louisiana.
UW-Madison said it is not aware of federal law enforcement activity on campus as of Monday. 
“International students, faculty, and staff are important members of the UW–Madison community, and the university deeply values their presence,” the university said in the statement. 
Mnookin also told faculty that while she can’t force people to, she is hopeful faculty will use their discretion to offer accommodations to affected students to help them finish their courses and degrees.
UW-Madison also pointed students to resources included in an update from April 2.
In that update to its international community, UW-Madison said it understood that ICE’s detainments of students at other institutions were “highly unsettling — especially for you and our broader international community.” 
“You are a valued and integral part of campus life, not only for the perspectives you bring to our teaching, research, and engagement mission, but also for the many ways you enrich the university’s social and cultural life,” Vice Provost and Dean Frances Vavrus said in a statement earlier this month. “We continue to be deeply grateful for your presence at UW–Madison.”

The Iowa House passed the bill, which the governor introduced in January, on a 92-4 vote Tuesday and sent it to her desk.
“Digital distractions are at an all-time high, disrupting focus, learning, and productivity in our classrooms,” Reynolds said in a statement. “Iowa students deserve to learn free from the disruption of personal electronic devices to fully focus on their education. We’ve seen tremendous progress in student behavior and engagement at our schools that have already implemented such policies. I look forward to signing this bill, allowing every Iowa student to once again prioritize learning.”

House File 782 would require Iowa’s K-12 public school boards to adopt a policy beginning in the 2025-2026 school year that, at minimum, bans the use of personal electronic devices during instructional periods. Boards have the option of restricting the use of phones in schools, including a full ban on the use of cellphones during the school day. The Iowa Department of Education is required to develop and distribute a model policy to schools.
There are some exceptions to the ban for students who have an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or 504 plan that requires accommodations that involves the use of a cellphone or another device, and in cases where a parent has petitioned the school district and established a “legitimate” reason related to a student’s mental or physical health that requires them to have a cellphone accessible during class.
The measure had been passed by the House in March, but it was sent back after the Senate amended the bill requiring the state education department to create and distribute the model policy for school personal electronic use by May 1. The House approved this amendment, though Rep. Heather Matson, D-Ankeny, expressed concerns that it was a “a little bit of a tight time frame” for the department unless the model policy is already constructed.
An provision in earlier versions of the bill that would have required students in grades 6 through 8 take “effects of social media” training was not included in the passed legislation.

“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.
In the hours and weeks that followed, the federal government launched a series of investigations into Maine institutions. Below is a running list of the federal government’s actions against the state:

U.S. Justice Department cuts Maine corrections grants reportedly over transgender policy


By: Lauren McCauley - Tuesday April 8, 2025 2:59 pm












The Maine Department of Corrections said Tuesday that the Department of Justice has terminated federal funding for several grant programs after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told “Fox and Friends”the cuts were because a transgender woman was incarcerated in a woman’s prison.
The DOC said that while it “is aware of related public statements” by Bondi, the department was only provided with a brief communication from the Department of Justice, which states that the awards are being terminated because they “no longer effectuate the program goals or agency priorities,” echoing the language of other notices sent by the Trump administration.
The terminated grants help pay for drug treatment for adults in reentry, programs that foster engagement between incarcerated parents and their children, and resources for corrections agencies to improve post-release supervision in order to prevent recidivism and reduce crime.

Maine AG sues Trump administration for USDA funding freeze that hit school meals


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday April 7, 2025 2:27 pm












The Maine Attorney General is suing the Trump administration for freezing funds that help feed children in schools and childcare centers, as well as adults with disabilities in congregate settings.
Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint Monday with the U.S. District Court in Maine against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins for their decision to withhold funding because of the state’s alleged violation of Title IX in educational programming.
In a letter sent to Gov. Janet Mills last Wednesday, Rollins that said she was freezing “Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools” and warned it was “only the beginning.” While the letter said the freeze would not affect programs that provide food to children, according to the complaint, the Child Nutrition Program of the Maine Department of Education was unable to access several sources of federal funding the following day.

Pingree calls for acting Social Security director to step down over ‘vindictive actions’


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday April 3, 2025 10:32 am












U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree reiterated her call for Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek to step down after leaked emails reported on by The Washington Post revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with President Donald Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
On March 6, the Social Security Administration notified the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
In a response to an emailed warning from a staff member that the change “would result in improper payments and potential for identity theft,” the acting director made clear that he acting in retaliation.
“While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child,” he wrote. 
In a statement Wednesday, Pingree asked, “If a federal agency can be turned into a political hit squad at the whim of an acting appointee, what checks remain on executive power?”
“Commissioner Dudek’s vindictive actions against Maine represent a fundamental betrayal of public trust that disqualifies him from public service. He should not only resign or be removed from office; he should be investigated for his flagrant abuse of power.” 
By March 7, the agency had reversed course after Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins sought answers about the action. A spokesperson for Collins previously told Maine Morning Star that the Republican received a call from Dudek during which he claimed it was done in error.
When asked about the insult, Mills told reporters: “This is the same guy that admitted that he suspended Maine’s enumeration at birth and funeral directors’ program. First, he said it was a mistake, said it was inadvertent, then, God bless, Sen. King and Sen. Collins got after him and then he admitted he did it on purpose because the governor of Maine was not ‘sufficiently cordial to the president and I said, ‘I can’t speak to that.’”

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

U.S. Department of Justice threatens to sue Maine


By: Maine Morning Star -  12:27 pm












In a letter to Mills dated Feb. 25, U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi threatened to sue the state if federal investigations show that “relevant Maine entities are indeed denying girls an equal opportunity to participate in sports and athletic events by requiring them to compete against” trans girls. 
“Maine should be on notice,” Bondi warned, adding that “the Department of Justice stands ready to take all appropriate action to enforce federal law,” referring to the Trump administration’s interpretation of TItle IX.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services determines Maine guilty of Title IX violation


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 25, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating Title IX. 
Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 15:07:11.676263

This coverage is made possible through a partnership between Grist and Interlochen Public Radio in Northern Michigan.
Jim Lively wants to install rooftop solar panels on his family’s local food market, just minutes from the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore in northern Michigan. Those panels could help power the RV campground they want to open next to the market and offset other electricity bills.
But even though Lively was awarded a $39,696 grant for the project through a U.S. Department of Agriculture program called the Rural Energy for America Program, or REAP, he’s not sure if he’ll be able to get the solar panels he wants. As one of thousands of grant awardees across the country, Lively was banking on that money to cover half the cost of the solar project.
Within President Donald Trump’s first few days in office, he issued a set of executive orders intended to crack down on government initiatives geared toward addressing climate change, improving environmental justice, and supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion. Amidst the now-familiar wave of fluctuations and uncertainty for farmers and business owners who had been counting on funding from various programs, Lively was told that the funding for REAP had been paused.
Late last month, Lively got a welcome update: The money was now unfrozen.
On March 25, the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it will release grant money through REAP and two other clean energy programs partly supported by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. But there appeared to be some fine print.
In the announcement, the USDA also invited grant and loan recipients to voluntarily revise their proposals to align with Trump’s executive order by “eliminating Biden-era DEIA and climate mandates embedded in previous proposals.”
In an email, a USDA spokesperson said that people who had already been awarded funding could voluntarily “review and revise” their plans within 30 days to more closely align with the Trump administration’s executive order. If recipients confirm in writing that they don’t want to change anything about their proposals, the USDA said “processing” for their projects would continue immediately. If recipients don’t communicate with the USDA, “disbursements and other actions will resume after the 30 days,” according to the statement. But many questions remain, and the agency did not address Grist’s requests for clarification.
For instance, the agency did not offer specifics about the timeline for already-approved projects to actually receive funds; whether or not the agency will open new application periods; whether the funding announcement and invitation to revise apply to REAP grants, loans, or both; and whether the announcement applies to future REAP applications.
Perhaps most crucially, it is also not clear what the agency means by “processing”: Will those who choose not to change their applications still receive the money they’d been awarded or will their proposals be subjected to another review process? The phrase “other actions” has many observers worried.
Mike Lavender, the policy director at the National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition, doesn’t expect to see the request barring farmers and businesses from receiving the money they are due, but acknowledges that “anything is possible with this USDA.”
“Our current understanding from the USDA is that REAP grantees will receive the reimbursements that they are owed under their signed grant agreements whether or not they choose to complete the voluntary REAP review form, including whether they submit the form stating they do not intend to make any modifications to their projects,” said Lavender. “It’s critical that USDA clearly and publicly affirms the voluntary nature of the REAP review to avoid sowing further confusion and uncertainty.”
Rebecca Wolf, a senior food policy analyst with the nonprofit Food & Water Watch, isn’t as confident that the program will proceed seamlessly. She said the very act of issuing the invitation in conjunction with news about resuming funding is likely to prompt farmers and business owners to feel pressured to comply for fear of not getting their money.
The ambiguity of it all is its own source of stress.
“I know there are folks that were awarded solar grants, that are wondering, ‘Does this even fall in line anymore? Because we know that the administration is keen more on fossil fuels,’” Wolf said. “So there’s just a ton of that type of, ‘What does this actually mean?’” What’s more, Wolf fears that this may only be the start of such so-called “open requests” issued by the agency to those waiting on paused funds.
The USDA’s efforts to comply with Trump’s executive orders are taking different shapes across the vast agency. A leaked internal memo circulated within the USDA’s Agricultural Research Service detailed instructions on reviewing “agreements” for a list of banned keywords, including “people of color,” “climate change,” and “clean energy,” as first reported by the nonprofit news organization More Perfect Union. And, last week, the USDA’s Rural Development agency scrubbed the application process for 14 programs — including REAP — of “scoring criteria” tied to equity and climate resilience goals established by the Biden administration.
Representative Chellie Pingree, the Democrat who represents part of southern Maine and is a member of the House Agriculture Committee, said she considers the USDA’s request for revisions “just another example of the chaos and confusion that have become hallmarks of the Trump Administration.” She added that the move is “petty and cruel.”
Representative Jill Tokuda, the Democrat who represents Hawai‘i’s second congressional district and also sits on the Agriculture Committee, told Grist, “USDA’s job is to support our agricultural producers and rural communities. It’s impossible to do that when USDA is adding unnecessary bureaucratic restrictions and blocking federal resources that farmers and rural communities depend on just to appease President Trump’s extreme agenda. Our farmers don’t have time to be jumping through extra hoops to get support for critical conservation work they depend on for their livelihoods. They need and deserve better.”
Grist reached out to the Republican chair of the House Agriculture Committee and two other GOP members for comment, none of whom responded before publication.
Other critics say the USDA’s actions could result in a return to the discriminatory practices the agency conducted for decades, such as rejecting disproportionately more loans for Black farmers than for any other demographic group and excluding Indigenous farmers from agricultural programs. Activists and scientists have also argued that many of the solutions necessary to mitigate agriculture’s gargantuan carbon footprint have been developed by marginalized communities. In this way, Trump’s attacks on justice and climate-smart agriculture are linked.
“From a climate-justice perspective, the implications of this decision, and the equally hostile policies we know are coming, are nothing short of devastating,” Pingree said.
All told, the USDA has so far complied with Trump’s efforts to eliminate DEI initiatives and climate action mechanisms across every level of the federal government. The agency has halted education, research, and state funding. It has paused a slate of programs receiving IRA funds and gutted others. The public messaging behind these moves has remained consistent: the agency, working in lockstep with the initiative known as the Department of Government Efficiency, aims “to enhance the USDA workforce and eliminate wasteful spending.”
According to Wolf, of Food & Water Watch, the USDA’s actions suggest the opposite. “We’ve seen a real gutting from Day 1, whether it’s jobs or funding,” she said. “And a very clear indication of how things are going to look moving forward.”
For his part, Jim Lively has decided to wait out the 30-day period rather than change any language. “It’s just a solar equipment installation project. There was no DEIA anything in there. So I don’t really think I need to make any changes,” he said. “We may just take our chances, leave things as they are, and hopefully we get a funding award announcement at the end of the month.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/solar-panel-farm-1024x576.webp,,,2025-04-08 15:07:11.676263

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)The Maine Department of Corrections said Tuesday that the Department of Justice has terminated federal funding for several grant programs after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi told “Fox and Friends” the cuts were because a transgender woman was incarcerated in a woman’s prison.
The DOC said that while it “is aware of related public statements” by Bondi, the department was only provided with a brief communication from the Department of Justice, which states that the awards are being terminated because they “no longer effectuate the program goals or agency priorities,” echoing the language of other notices sent by the Trump administration.
The terminated grants help pay for drug treatment for adults in reentry, programs that foster engagement between incarcerated parents and their children, and resources for corrections agencies to improve post-release supervision in order to prevent recidivism and reduce crime.
During her appearance on Fox, which was first reported by the Portland Press Herald, Bondi said the Justice Department was terminating “nonessential” programs because of the state policy related to transgender detainees, which it approaches on a case-by-case basis. 
The DOC said it is evaluating the impacts to services from these funding terminations.
The notice of the cuts comes one day after Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey sued the U.S. Department of Agriculture for freezing funds because of the state’s alleged violation of Title IX in educational programming. 
Title IX does not reference trangender people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy allowing trans students to compete in athletics that align with the gender identity as discrimination against cisgender girls. 
In the complaint, Frey argues that the freeze is unlawful because it did not follow the legal process to alter congressionally appropriated funds, including a regulation from the USDA to hold a hearing and issue a formal decision before terminating funds. 
Several other federal agencies have launched investigations into Maine since Gov. Janet Mills got into a heated confrontation with President Donald Trump over the state’s protections for transgender student athletes.
Both the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services determined Maine’s polices allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports, which is supported by the Maine Human Rights Act, violate federal protections against sex-based discrimination in schools. 
The U.S. DOE gave Maine a deadline of April 11 to propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office or said the case will be referred to the Department of Justice.

(Photo by Dan Forer/Getty Images)The New Hampshire Attorney General’s Office argued before a federal appeals court Tuesday that a federal district court was wrong when it struck down a 2021 state law barring teachers from endorsing certain concepts related to race and gender.
Appearing before the First Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston, the Attorney General’s Office argued that the earlier decision should be reversed and the law should be allowed to take effect. 
Mary Triick, a lawyer for the Attorney General’s Office, disagreed with the district court that the law was too vague, and said the plaintiffs had improperly filed the lawsuit before the law had been applied against anyone. Lawyers for the plaintiffs, who include teachers unions, countered that the law is too difficult to follow and that it would unconstitutionally chill classroom discussions if allowed to stand. 
The law, passed via House Bill 544 and later added to the 2021 budget bill, bars educators and public employees from endorsing any of four concepts: that people of one protected class such as race, gender, or sexual orientation are superior to those of another protected class; that people of one class are inherently oppressive of people of another class; that people of one class should receive adverse treatment compared to people of another class; and that people should not attempt to treat others without regard to their protected class.
Teachers who violate the law are in breach of the educator code of conduct and may be punished by the State Board of Education, which may take a number of actions, including suspending the teacher’s license. 
The law, often referred to by opponents as the “divisive concepts law,” was inspired by an executive order signed by President Donald Trump near the end of his first term, and came about as Republicans began voicing concerns that “critical race theory” was being taught in public schools.
In May 2024, Judge Paul Barbadoro of the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire invalidated the law, ruling that the provisions amounted to “viewpoint-based restrictions on speech,” that they were too vague for educators to follow without fear of arbitrary enforcement, and that they violated the 14th Amendment.
Nearly a year later, Triick argued the law does provide clear guidelines for teachers to follow. And she noted that federal case law and New Hampshire statute both say that state and local governments are allowed to curtail and direct public school teachers’ speech so long as it is speech directly related to their teaching. 
“The reason teachers don’t have First Amendment protections in their curricular speech is because it doesn’t offend the First Amendment when the state says, ‘we have these public schools and we are going to control what our students are taught in the public schools, and we’re going to hire teachers to teach those things,’” she said.
She added: “I do think that we can get to a point if you say that the state cannot control that speech, can that teacher say anything to that student? Like, what if the teacher is saying that the beliefs of the Nazis were a good idea? Like, the state obviously has a right to control that speech.”
Triick also noted the plaintiffs had filed the lawsuit without being able to point to a specific case in which the new laws had been unfairly applied to teachers or other public employees — a move known as a “pre-enforcement racial vagueness challenge.” Without such a case, the district court should not have struck down the law, Triick said.
“Nobody has had this statute enforced against them,” she said. “Nobody’s due process rights have been violated. And so it’s reasonable to say when we’re talking about a federal court invalidating a state statute that has never been enforced, that has never been interpreted by the state court, that you need to meet a high standard. You need to prove that there’s no set of circumstances under which it could be constitutionally and reasonably enforced.” 
Attorneys for the plaintiffs, meanwhile, pointed to extensive interviews they had conducted with New Hampshire state officials as part of the discovery process in which they said those officials could not answer questions about how the law should be applied.
The responses indicate the law is hard to interpret even for the departments charged with carrying out the law, argued Charles Moerdler, a lawyer for Stroock & Stroock & Lavan in New York, representing the plaintiffs. 
“They don’t know, and they are enforcing it on a basis they don’t know,” Moerdler said. 
And Gilles Bissonnette, legal director at the ACLU of New Hampshire, maintained the argument that the law is unconstitutionally vague and a suppression of the First Amendment. The lines between when a teacher is promoting discussion of a banned concept and when a teacher is directly endorsing that concept are too blurry to effectively navigate, Bissonnette said.
“An educator doesn’t know,” he said. “If I just assign a topic, if I … have students play devil’s advocate, if I even … have students engage in the Socratic method, are they covered? …How are educators supposed to know?”
New Hampshire Republican lawmakers are currently trying to amend the divisive concepts law, which is still on the state’s statutes despite being struck down last year. House Bill 50, which passed the House in March, would change the law so that a teacher could be punished by the State Board of Education only after “intentional or knowing violation” of the law. 
Judges on the circuit court asked sharp questions of both sides. They asked Triick how teachers should follow the law if it is unclear when a teacher is interacting with a student outside of their official duties — and is thus protected by the First Amendment — and when a teacher is acting within their official duties. They also questioned how teachers could lead nuanced discussions without accidentally falling afoul of the law.
But they also challenged plaintiffs to cite any precedent in which a similar law was struck down on vagueness or free speech arguments before that law has been applied to anyone. They suggested the struggle of New Hampshire officials to answer questions about the new law could simply be because the law has not been tested yet. 
“I think the problem here with just evaluating this in individual cases is that the underlying fear and harm, whether or not First Amendment interests are implicated here, is that there is inherent chill in the classroom, including curricular speech, regardless of whether it’s protected,” said Bissonnette.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/classroomperpupil-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 15:07:11.676263

A bill (HB 301) dealing with the state’s sovereign immunity limits advanced out of its final committee stop in the House with three “no” votes but not before the House Judiciary Committee tagged on an amendment that significantly limits the amounts of recoverable damages planned and phases them in over five years.
Under the amended bill, the sovereign immunity limits would be increased to $500,000 per person and $1 million per incident for claims accruing on or after Oct. 1, 2025. The caps increase to $600,000 per person and $1.1 million per occurrence for claims that accrue on or after Oct. 1, 2030.
The existing sovereign immunity caps are set at $200,000 per person and $300,000 per occurrence and were last altered in 2010. The original bill would have increased the caps to $1 million per person and $3 million per occurrence.

Bill sponsor Rep. Fiona McFarland offered the amendment as the Legislature enters the second half of its 60-day regular legislative session. The Senate has yet to consider the companion bill. McFarland said the Senate has not agreed to her amendment.










I don't have a perfect solution. I just have an improvement on our current state.


– Rep. Fiona McFarland


McFarland’s call to lower the caps swayed at least one member of the committee Tuesday to vote for the bill: Rep. Rachel Plakon, who thanked McFarland “for working with both sides of this issue.” 
  Rep. Danny Alvarez (Photo via the Florida House of Representatives)
But others lamented the caps being lowered. “Why don’t we just leave it at this: I’m sad to see that you felt pressure that you had to reduce the amount, especially in modern times, to make this pass. I’m sorry,” Rep. Danny Alvarez said during committee debate on the bill.
McFarland’s amendment didn’t alter other provisions meant to change how the sovereign immunity process works. The bill still has language allowing political subdivisions to settle cases beyond the sovereign immunity limits without having to obtain legislative approval. It also prohibits insurance companies from conditioning payment of settlements on enactment of claims bills.
Sovereign immunity affects a large swath of special interests, from schools, cities, counties, public hospitals, police, and firefighters and people injured by those entities. Not surprisingly, the bill attracted 203 lobbyist registrations and is the most tracked bill among LobbyTools subscribers.
Liability thresholds 
Sovereign immunity stems from the Latin phrase “rex non potest peccare,” which translates to “the king cannot commit a legal wrong.” In legal terms, it refers to the state’s authority to exempt itself as a legal sovereign from civil lawsuits, although the state does allow negligence claims against itself and its subdivisions — agencies, cities, counties, and public hospitals — within limits. 
Injured parties can sue for damages and collect within the liability thresholds established by law, but if they win awards in excess of the limits they must go to the Legislature in the form of what’s called a claims bill to collect. But the claims bill process is lengthy. It also allows the defendant to challenge the jury verdict at the legislative level.
Once a claims bill is filed, each chamber’s presiding officer refers it to a special master, who essentially reconsiders the jury’s recommendation. Claims bills also go before House and Senate committees that consider special masters’ recommendations. Ultimately, the bills must pass in both chambers. It’s not unusual for claims bills to take years to pass, if ever.
 “We do have concerns with the provision of the bill that would not allow an insurance company to require a claims bill to be passed, and for a claims bill not to be required in certain circumstances,” Florida League of Cities Deputy General Counsel David Cruz said, opposing the bill during public debate. “We feel there’s value in the claims bill process, and so we would encourage the Legislature to continue the claims bill process.”
Cruz said McFarland’s amendment to lower the limits “put the bill in a better direction” but added, “We are concerned that the caps have to be placed at the right limit.”
City of Belleair Bluffs Commissioner Karen Rafferty argued the limits should be increased to $300,000 per individual and $500,000 per incident. From there, the caps could be lifted every two to three years by the consumer price index (CPI). 
McFarland in her closing testimony said she doesn’t know the “right number” for the sovereign immunity limits or even that the limits agreed to in 2010 were right.
“I don’t know what the right number ultimately is. Perhaps we’ll continue to negotiate it in the chamber and with our partners across the rotunda and get to some amount that we can all feel okay about,” she said.
McFarland then doubled down on the changes to the sovereign immunity process.
“We can do numbers all day. We are the appropriators. We understand how to do state budgets. But we don’t as a body understand how to dispose of judicial matters, and that’s what the claims bill process asks us to. I don’t have a perfect solution. I just have an improvement on our current state.”

Free.,IRS to share immigrants' tax info with DHS,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/irs-share-immigrants-tax-info-dhs,,"WASHINGTON — The IRS and Department of Homeland Security reached an agreement Monday to share tax information of immigrants who have final orders of removal to help immigration agents find and deport the immigrants, according to documents filed in court.No information between the two agencies has been shared yet, according to the filings in federal court in the District of Columbia, but the partnership would impact more than 1 million immigrants with final removal orders, as the Trump administration carries out mass deportations of immigrants without permanent legal status.According to a memorandum of understanding signed by Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and submitted to the court, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials can ask the IRS to provide information about immigrants with orders of removal or immigrants involved in criminal investigations.Some of that tax information includes sensitive details such as current addresses and information about child tax dependents.It would be the first time the IRS shared sensitive tax information to carry out immigration enforcement.In 2023, immigrants in the country without legal authority paid more than $89 billion in taxes, according to the left-leaning think tank the American Immigration Council.In order to file taxes without a social security number, someone who is not a U.S. citizen would use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or an ITIN. As of 2022, there were more than 5.8 million active ITINs, according to a report by the Treasury Department Inspect General.Groups challenging information sharingThe government filed the document in a case brought by immigration rights groups the Centro de Trabajadores Unidos and Immigrant Solidarity DuPage. The groups are trying to block the IRS from sharing tax records with DHS for immigration enforcement, arguing that such sharing violates IRS disclosure laws.The Trump administration moved Monday to dismiss the suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, arguing that “providing information to assist criminal investigations—is lawful.”A hearing on a preliminary injunction to block such information sharing between IRS and DHS is set for April 16 before federal Judge Dabney L. Friedrich, whom President Donald Trump appointed in 2017.Friedrich ruled against the groups last month, when they asked for a temporary restraining order following a story by The Washington Post that the agencies were considering sharing information in order to find immigrants to deport.“A single news report about future cooperation between the IRS and DHS does not establish that the plaintiffs’ members are facing imminent injury,” according to the March 19 order.",,,,2025-04-08 15:07:11.676263

Last month, the USDA cancelled $500 million worth of food that had been planned to go to food banks across the country through TEFAP, or The Emergency Food Assistance Program.
The Montana Food Bank Network, which serves 330 partners in the state, said in 2024 the organization distributed 3.2 million pounds of TEFAP food, an estimated $6.3 million worth.
The Network’s Brent Weisgram said the organization is still analyzing the effects, but the recent cut represents a 40% reduction of its TEFAP allocation, or $2.5 million worth of food.
The Network’s partners include community food banks, pantries, schools, senior centers and shelters, according to data on its website.
Weisgram said the Network is working with its development team to come up with strategies and letting all of its partners know to “brace for potential impacts.”
The Network said 73 partners in 35 counties that receive and distribute TEFAP food will be affected by the cancellations.
“The challenging part of that is that a lot of our rural service providers, our pantries in rural senior centers, they really depend on that for the majority of the food,” Weisgram said.
He said another USDA program, the Local Food Purchase Assistance Grant, won’t be renewed in 2025. Last year the grant provided $100,000 to purchase fresh produce from Montana producers.
One of the largest food banks in western Montana also said it will be affected by the cuts.
In a news release, the Missoula Food Bank and Community Center said it is losing an estimated $180,000 in inventory, or 91,000 pounds of food, with the recent reduction, and the cut comes on top of record demand.
“With rising grocery prices and increasing financial strain on households, we are seeing a higher need than ever before and only expect demand to continue to rise,” the food bank said in a news release.
Missoula Food Bank Executive Director Amy Allison said the nonprofit is grateful for the continued generosity of the community, whether in contributions of food, funds or volunteer time, and it will need more help than ever.
“Without this federal support, the food bank will need the public’s support more than ever in ensuring everyone has access to nutritious food when they need it,” Allison said in a statement.
In 2024, the Missoula Food Bank and Community Center distributed 2.81 million pounds of food to local families, including 228,290 pounds from TEFAP, according to the news release.
Weisgram, with the Network, said his organization’s daily operations won’t be affected by the cut. He said the Network distributed 16.3 million pounds of food through all of its programs in 2024.
Food from TEFAP accounted for roughly 20%, purchased food made up 18%, and the remaining 62% was donated food, according to data from the Network.
Weisgram said TEFAP wasn’t meant to be a social services program, but an agriculture program.
The government sets aside funding in the farm bill and provides supplemental funding at times to help prop up agriculture by buying commodities, food then distributed through organizations such as the Montana Food Bank Network.
The Biden administration approved the Commodity Credit Corp, “supplemental funding” to be distributed through TEFAP.
A December 2024 memo from the USDA about the supplemental funding said it will help emergency food organizations “as they continue to deal with supply chain challenges and elevated food costs” by supporting purchases and other needs.
But a USDA spokesperson told Yahoo! news last week the funding that had been from the Commodity Credit Corp “has been repurposed.”
“The Biden administration created unsustainable programming and expectations using the Commodity Credit Corporation,” the spokesperson said.
Weisgram, though, said the Trump administration is evaluating the program as “supplemental,” not foundational, but the situation on the ground has changed.
“Unfortunately, what they don’t realize is, you look at what’s going on as far as inflation, the economy, the number of people that are utilizing assistance programs, the foundation is still not meeting the need,” Weisgram said. “We need supplemental funding.”
In the meantime, he said, he expects demand to continue to grow.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/GettyImages-1324395.jpg,,,2025-04-08 15:07:11.676263

But recently as I was scrolling my Instagram feed, I was stopped in my tracks by a post from Gov. Spencer [&#8230;]","Signage welcomes visitors to Bureau of Land Management land near Cedar City on Sunday, Feb. 2, 2025.Like any person after a long day of work, I like to sit on my couch and scroll social media. Normally this is a non-confrontational experience full of cooking tutorials, updates from friends, and memes. But recently as I was scrolling my Instagram feed, I was stopped in my tracks by a post from Gov. Spencer Cox. In this post, he insinuates that Utah’s campaign for control of national public lands is to “keep public lands in public hands” accompanied by a video highlighting Utah’s beautiful landscapes. This could not be further from the truth when examining the state’s track record.
It’s not surprising that a post about who should steward our precious public lands has gotten my attention. As the chapter director for the Utah Sierra Club, I spend my time working to preserve Utah’s natural beauty and our clean air and water. Each and every day, I hear from Utahns about why national public lands are important to them.
Currently, most public lands in Utah are managed by the federal government on behalf of us all. The Bureau of Land Management, in particular, oversees nearly 23 million acres in the state, including world renowned red rock canyon country, vast areas of the sagebrush sea, high mountain peaks, and spectacular rivers. These places contain significant cultural landscapes and historic sites, outstanding outdoor recreation opportunities, important wildlife habitat, and critical water resources. We are incredibly fortunate that our public lands, waters, and wildlife are public assets. They are not a luxury available only to the few, but are vital to our individual and collective well-being. By being managed in the public trust, these lands include some of the last great vast, wild spaces left in this country, and their benefits to our health, our history and our heritage cannot be overlooked.
So what’s the problem? The Utah state government wants to take over public lands currently managed by the federal government, claiming this will help Utah citizens. Gov. Cox has pushed even harder for state control of these public lands through the “Stand for our Land” Campaign. Unless you’re an oil tycoon or gas mogul, state command of our public lands will not help you. Utah government management of public lands makes it easier to sell or lease them for oil and mineral extraction, and if the state sells or leases those lands to extractive industries, it is likely that those companies will block public access altogether.
The truth is the Utah state government sees dollar signs: Utah has already sold off more than 50% of its state trust land — over 4.1 million acres — restricting public access including for recreation. Control of public lands is not about protecting them, it’s about selling them to the highest bidder. The state will not steward our lands with conservation in mind, and that’s why this land grab should be scary to all of us.
When I moved to Utah six years ago I shared with a coworker that I’m from Riverside, California. She joked and said “You must not like good air quality, you’ve gone from one bad air city to another.” Now, of course, I do, but unfortunately, I’m all too familiar with the pollution that will come with allowing the state to develop on public lands. If you know anything about Riverside, you know it has some of the worst air quality in the country. And my family felt the effects deeply. While growing up, I frequently was in the hospital with my brothers who suffered from asthma.
Protecting natural, open spaces like national public lands is crucial to maintaining clean air and clean water for our communities–not to mention for local recreation economies. Some studies estimate that every dollar spent on creating and maintaining park trails can save almost three dollars in health care costs alone.
I urge you to pay attention to this latest move by our state government. If you, like me, care about access to natural spaces for you, your kids, your grandkids, and their kids, then you should be ready to make your voice heard. I invite you to join me in sharing your love for public lands and waters by contacting our state leaders to urge them to stop attacking the places so many of us cherish.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/020225_Bureau-of-Land-Management_28-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 14:11:54.776073

Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people [&#8230;]","A woman sits with her daughters at a clinic operated by a community health center in New Orleans. Such centers rely on funding from Medicaid, which congressional Republicans want to cut. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

Thomas Manger said during a hearing on the department’s budget request.“I think that’s what bothered most cops and it did certainly have an impact on the USCP,” Manger added. “We’ve got so much change that officers are experiencing over the last four years, so I'm trying to keep them focused on moving forward. But it certainly did have a negative impact. For cops all over this country, you wonder when you put your life on the line every day, and does it matter?”On Trump’s first day in office, he pardoned nearly 1,500 people who were convicted of crimes related to attacking the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, while members of Congress moved through the process to certify President Joe Biden’s win of the Electoral College vote.Many of those people went to the Capitol after attending a rally near the White House where Trump repeated false claims about winning the 2020 presidential election, despite numerous failed court cases and no evidence of widespread voter fraud.Manger testified during the House Appropriations Legislative Branch Subcommittee hearing that the department has made numerous improvements since the attacks, but that its nearly $1 billion budget request is necessary to hire more officers and continue updating equipment.“I recognize that there are other police departments of a similar size whose budget is not as large as ours. But we’re not an ordinary law enforcement agency,"" Manger said. ""The USCP is unlike any traditional police department. In fact, our mission incorporates elements similar to the FBI, U.S. Secret Service and the federal protective service.”Manger said that in the four years since the Jan. 6 attack, USCP has made substantial changes to how it operates and that many of its “mission requirements simply did not exist four years ago.”",,,,2025-04-08 14:11:54.776073

Mahdi could still appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to halt his execution or ask Gov. Henry McMaster to change his sentence to life in prison. Neither option was successful for any of the four inmates executed in the state over the past seven months.
Mahdi’s attorneys argued Judge Clifton Newman, the sentencing judge in 2006, was unable to fully to consider Mahdi’s traumatic childhood because his original defense attorneys failed to give him enough information.
If Newman had known more about Mahdi’s life, such as alleged abuse by his father and the thousands of hours Mahdi spent in solitary confinement as a teenager, the judge might have decided to instead hand down a lesser sentence, Mahdi’s current legal team argued.
All five state Supreme Court justices disagreed in a 13-page order issued Monday.
The justices pointed to a number of violent incidents Newman considered in sentencing Mahdi to death.
Among them was a 2001 incident in Richmond, Virginia, when Mahdi stabbed a maintenance worker nearly to death. Justices also noted his multiple escape attempts while he was in jail, including as his trial began.

The justices wrote that Mahdi’s previous defense teams put up an adequate defense, arguing his decisions were affected by age, mental illness and a turbulent childhood. Every court that has considered those arguments has turned them down.
Mahdi’s crime spree began in Virginia, where he stole a gun and a car before fleeing south.
He later allegedly told investigators he fled after killing someone in a drug deal gone awry, but he was never charged for the crime, the state Supreme Court wrote.
Stopping in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Mahdi shot gas station clerk Christopher Boggs point-blank in the face before continuing on to South Carolina. Mahdi carjacked a man in Columbia, then fled in rural Calhoun County and hid out in a shed.
There, he shot Orangeburg Public Safety officer James Myers with his own gun, then lit his body on fire and stole his police car. Officers arrested Mahdi in Florida three days later.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/execution.jpg,,,2025-04-08 14:11:54.776073

Michelle Lujan Grisham signed on Monday.
The Fines and Fees Justice Center, a criminal justice advocacy group, praised Lujan Grisham’s enactment of Senate Bill 375 in a news release on Tuesday morning, calling the new law a “smart on crime initiative” to lift unnecessary financial barriers that stop people from returning home.
The group said that parole supervision fees can prevent people from successfully reintegrating into their communities when they get out, racking up large debts for the families of people on supervision across the U.S.
Under the old law, New Mexico charged between $25 and $150 per month, with a yearly cap of $1,800, and incarcerated people could not get out on parole until they paid the fees.
About 2,400 New Mexicans were out on parole in 2023, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.
“Every dollar spent on a parole fee could have been a dollar put towards food, childcare or supporting local businesses,” New Mexico State Director Monica Ault said in a statement. “Ending these fees isn’t just the right thing to do — it’s smart fiscal policy that can reinvigorate local economies.” 
Sen. Antonio “Moe” Maestas (D-Albuquerque), who sponsored SB375, said Tuesday that ending parole fees “lifts a huge financial burden off people who have already paid their debt, giving them a real chance to prioritize their families and rebuild their lives.”
“Family is everything to New Mexicans,” Maestas said in a statement. “This law is the next step in our push to make our communities strong, safe, and prosperous for all.”    
New Mexico Corrections Department Cabinet Secretary Alisha Tafoya and her staff wrote the bill, the Fines and Fees Justice Center said.
“We believe that alleviating this financial burden will reduce recidivism by removing barriers for individuals transitioning from prison facilities to communities,” Tafoya Lucero said in a statement. “This change allows them to, instead, direct their financial resources toward essential needs like housing and transportation, which are key elements for stability and avoiding criminal activity.”
The Fines and Fees Justice Center noted on Tuesday that New Mexico joins dozens of state and local governments in eliminating harmful criminal legal system fees, including the state of Maryland, which scrapped certain supervision fees last October while the governor there erased more than $13 million in outstanding court debt.

U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he’s proud of Utah’s push to eliminate fluoride from drinking water, telling reporters he hopes other states follow suit.
Kennedy spoke to a crowded room of journalists, lawmakers and health officials on Monday, part of a tour of Western states to promote his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, known as MAHA.
“If we want to be a moral nation, if we want to maintain our moral authority around the world, our chief obligation is to our children. And we’re letting them down. And I’m very, very happy that Utah is taking the lead in so many ways,” Kennedy said on Monday. “It makes no sense to have fluoride in our water. The evidence against fluoride is overwhelming … we know that it causes I.Q. loss.”

Fluoride is a mineral that has been shown to strengthen teeth by replacing minerals that are lost from acid breakdown, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A recent report from the National Toxicology Program found that high levels of fluoride in drinking water can be associated with a lower I.Q. in children — but according to the report, those levels are twice as high as the current recommended amount of fluoride.
Kennedy spoke to several bills that align with the MAHA agenda, mostly focusing on HB81, the fluoride bill. Sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, the bill prohibits municipalities from adding fluoride to drinking water, while adding it to the list of drugs that pharmacists can prescribe.
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz said that’s a “win-win” situation.
Idaho Legislature approves ban on SNAP coverage for candy, soda

“We want to make sure those options are there” for Utahns who want more fluoride than what’s available in toothpaste or mouthwash, said Schultz, R-Hooper, who spoke during Monday’s press conference.
The bill received pushback from dentists and other health professionals, who say adding fluoride to drinking water has resulted in less cavities among children. That includes Dr. Sarah Woolsey, a family physician who told lawmakers during a legislative committee meeting that she saw a decrease in referrals for cavity extractions under anesthesia after Salt Lake County started to add fluoride to its water.
“Despite my efforts in education, in prescribing fluoride and working with parents, the voluntary application does not always work for those that may be most vulnerable,” said Woolsey. “And I would like to say that since fluoride has been in the water, the number of kids I send (to have teeth extracted) is significantly less.”
The bill passed mostly along party lines, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. It was signed by the governor on March 27, and takes effect on May 7.

After the press conference on Monday, Kennedy told the Associated Press he will instruct the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending state and local governments add fluoride to drinking water. He also told the Associated Press he will set up a task force to look into the issue.
Lee Zeldin, a former GOP congressman and the current head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the agency is going to review all the fluoride-related studies that came out since the National Toxicology Program report in 2024.
“We’re prepared to act based on this science,” said Zeldin, who also spoke during the event on Monday. “Both the National Toxicology Program study, as well as other peer-reviewed studies. If this is as important as it is to Secretary Kennedy, if it’s important as it is, clearly to so many people who are here in this room and at this press conference today, then it is top of the list for the Environmental Protection Agency.”

Kennedy suggested Gricius’ bill could be a model for other states.
“I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban (fluoride). I hope many more will come,” he said on Monday, echoing the argument from Utah lawmakers this session — that it’s an issue of bodily autonomy and freedom of choice.
“We shouldn’t be demanding that parents accept something in their children and homes that is essentially a medication. They can go to a drug store and get toothpaste,” Kennedy said. “I think it’s a moral imperative that we all believe in freedom of choice in this country, it’s one of the bedrock principles of our democracy.”
Utah becomes the first state to ban adding fluoride to drinking water

Kennedy also touted two other bills passed by the legislature and signed by the governor.
HB402, sponsored by Rep. Kristen Chevrier, R-Highland, bans public schools from using certain food dyes and other preservatives and additives — including potassium bromate and propylparaben — in food preparation.
And HB403, also sponsored by Chevrier, restricts Utahns who receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — a federal program that subsidizes food purchases for low-income individuals — from buying soda.
“We anticipate that this is the beginning of a cultural shift that will extend throughout the nation, a shift towards proactively building health rather than treating disease,” said Chevrier during the news conference Monday.
Kennedy, former presidential candidate, environmental attorney, son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former president John F. Kennedy, was nominated to lead the country’s Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump.
Kennedy has long promoted public health reform, healthy diets and alternative treatments to chronic diseases — some of his stances have been controversial, including skepticism around certain vaccines, advocating against fluoride in drinking water, and claims that COVID-19 impacts certain ethnic groups differently.

Free.,U.S. House Republicans object to GOP budget for not cutting enough spending,Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-house-republicans-object-gop-budget-not-cutting-enough-spending,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson said Tuesday he’s still planning to hold a floor vote this week to adopt the budget resolution that senators signed off on last weekend, despite opposition from enough Republican lawmakers to block final approval.Johnson, R-La., said that he and others, including President Donald Trump, are working to address concerns the blueprint directs the Senate to cut a minimum of $4 billion, while the House instructions task several committees with cutting at least $1.5 trillion in spending. Some House Republicans say they don’t want to move ahead because the Senate number is too low.Both chambers of Congress must adopt the same version of the budget resolution before they can use the complex reconciliation process to extend the 2017 tax cuts, bolster spending on border security and defense by hundreds of billions of dollars, and reduce government spending.Johnson said during a press conference that a House vote to adopt the budget resolution, which the Senate approved early Saturday morning, just starts off the process. He also said writing the actual reconciliation bill would be “a collaborative process between the House and Senate.”“You're going to see the Republican Party in both chambers working together as one team. I know that's a rare occasion, and people don't really know what that looks like, but we're actually going to do it this time,” Johnson said. “The House is not going to participate in an us-versus-them charade. We won't do it.”House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., told reporters following a closed-door GOP conference meeting on Tuesday morning that the chamber could stay in session this weekend, if leaders cannot get the votes they need lined up during the next few days.“We've got to get it done,” Scalise said. “Failure is not an option.”The House is set to leave for a two-week break on Thursday.'A joke from the Senate'House Republicans can only lose three votes and still adopt the budget resolution, given their extremely thin 220-seat majority. As of Tuesday, many more than three GOP lawmakers have expressed reservations or said outright they won’t vote to approve the budget resolution.Texas Rep. Chip Roy said the $4 billion floor in spending cuts in the Senate’s reconciliation instructions “is clearly not sufficient.”“It's, frankly, a joke from the Senate. And it's more of the same swamp stuff that we've been dealing with for years, and so nothing's changed,” Roy said. “So, you know, we have to draw a line in the sand now on a budget, and the Senate's budget is not there.”Roy said he “wouldn't advise” House leaders to bring the budget resolution to the floor for a vote this week and that he “didn't come here to make deficits go up.”The House’s reconciliation instructions allow the Ways and Means Committee to increase deficits by up to $4.5 trillion to extend the 2017 tax cuts that were set to expire at the end of this year.The House’s budget blueprint also gives the Armed Services Committee a cap of $100 billion in new spending, Homeland Security a $90 billion ceiling for new funding for programs it oversees, and the Judiciary Committee a maximum of $110 billion in new spending.The House tasks several other committees with cutting at least $1.5 trillion over the same time period, including $880 billion in cuts by the panel that oversees major health care programs like Medicare and Medicaid.Trump weighs inTennessee Rep. Tim Burchett said he was undecided, but leaning against voting to approve the budget resolution since it proposed too much spending and not enough cuts.Burchett said he wasn’t invited to a White House meeting taking place later in the day, but that Trump has his phone number and can call him if he wants to.South Carolina Rep. Ralph Norman said he wanted to amend the budget resolution to require the Senate to cut the same amount as the House. He also said he wanted Trump to weigh in.Trump posted on social media Monday evening that the Senate-passed budget had his “Complete and Total Endorsement and Support.”“There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE! The House, the Senate, and our Great Administration, are going to work tirelessly on creating “THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL,” an appropriate name if Congress so likes,” Trump wrote. “Everyone is going to be happy with the result. Passage will make, even the subject of World Trade, far easier and better for the U.S.A.

Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.

Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”

Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.

State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.

Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

(Jill Rice)TOPEKA — Societal rules — written and unwritten — and how power is distributed and wielded within communities are new measures tracked by an annual report that offers insights into health at a county level.
The 2025 County Health Rankings and Roadmap report, put out by the University of Wisconsin Public Health Institute and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, is used by local, regional and state leaders to determine how to understand and impact the health of residents within their communities. Factors that impact health were updated this year for the first time since 2014, said Bethany Rogerson, UWPHI co-director.
“We are focused on lifting up policies and practices that can create the conditions so that everyone has the ability to thrive,” she said. “Where you live, where you work all play a really important role in shaping health, and that health is more than health care.”
The addition of societal rules and power categories encourages communities to assess those concepts and determine how to make policy and practical changes to improve the health of citizens, Rogerson said.
“We know that community conditions don’t just happen by chance,” she said. “So we realized an opportunity to invite people to explore how community conditions come to be. How did our housing, how did our jobs, our schools, all the aspects that we know shape health, how did they come to be and who shaped them and how?”
SENT Topeka, an organization that works to support Topeka residents through building resilience and relationships, uses the County Health Rankings for data and health insights. Founder and executive director Johnathan Sublet said the new measures fit into the work the organization is doing. He pointed to the food pantry at SENT, which is structured to work like a grocery store where people have choice.
“The first thing a person often loses when they become under-resourced is choice,” Sublet said. “When we define poverty, it is not just the access to money. We define it as lack of choice in a person’s life. Every single person has infinite dignity, value and worth. We want to do everything we can to affirm that dignity, value and worth they have.”
“Part of that means giving them choice back, and it also means giving them power in decisions that are being made within their sphere of influence,” he added.
  In 2025, the University of Wisconsin Public Health Institute added new measures to its annual County Health Rankings and Roadmap report. (Kansas Health Institute)
New measures support change
Wyatt Beckman, senior analyst with Kansas Health Institute, said the broad categories of societal rules and power added this year support discussion at the county level that can be impactful in looking at how the factors influence community conditions.
Expanding the conversation can elicit change, he said.
“You can build community power when you organize and act together, and do things like set agendas, shape who’s involved in discussion and decision-making, cultivate relationships, and that power can shape societal rules,” Beckman said. “Power is not meant to be listed as an inherently good or bad thing, but it’s an acknowledgement and does help us have conversations about not only the factors that are shaping health, but how those factors are being influenced and maybe can be adjusted.”
An example Beckman offered is the education people receive, which he said is important to quality of life and shaping experiences.
“Some of the big decisions around that education can be shaped by people who sit on boards of education. Those boards of education have a role in shaping the budgets and policies and regulations that inform and guide that education,” he said.
Communities can ask questions about who is invited into  policy-making discussions, including whether they’re encouraging and receiving diverse opinions. Partnership and building trust are key elements in working together as a community, Sublet said. At SENT Topeka, focusing on dignity and support are key to building that trust.
“Dignity for us means not doing for someone what they can and should do for themselves. We don’t give away everything for free that we do,” he said. “It means that we don’t feel like we transform people’s lives or change people’s lives, but we journey with them in their lives as much as they allow us to.”
Important in their interactions is not feeling as if SENT Topeka is “the voice for the people,” Sublet said.
“We want to help them understand the voice they already have and affirm that,” he said. “While we’ll help prepare them for conversations, we don’t feel it’s our job to go in and speak for them in situations.”
Additional new measures included in the County Health Rankings and Roadmap report this year are:

Access to libraries
Disability: Functional limitations
Feelings of loneliness
Lack of social and emotional support
Access to parks
Adverse climate events

Beckman said the County Health Rankings report is especially helpful at a community level because even when the state may seem to overall be doing well with specific measures, individual counties may be having a different experience.
He noted that most Kansas counties are doing better than the average county in the United States, but that doesn’t mean there aren’t individual counties showing challenges.
As an example, he pointed to Russell, Edwards and Kingman counties, which have seen “years for potential life lost” increasing at a level higher than what is seen in the state and U.S. overall.
That factor is a unique angle on what most of us think as life expectancy, Beckman said.
“What years of potential life lost does is it adds up and turns into a rate all of the years between a person dies and the age 75,” he said. “So it sets age 75 as that average life expectancy, and any deaths before that are added up. What that means in practice is if there are, for whatever reason, things that are causing earlier deaths in a community, that’s really going to increase years of potential life lost.”
Beckman called the increase in years of potential life lost “pretty stark,” and said the increase can’t be explained by the COVID-19 pandemic. While the County Health Rankings report doesn’t answer why that’s happening, it provides the information so that county and state officials can dig deeper.
 
Report may end in 2026
Broadening of data collected in the County Health Rankings and Roadmap report comes even as its publisher, the University of Wisconsin Public Health Institute, expects to lose funding in 2026. The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation is pulling funding it has supplied for the past 15 years.
“RWJF remains committed to public health data and to meeting the needs of the communities we strive to serve,” a foundation spokesperson said. “We remain steadfast in our support of the UWPHI team in this final chapter to ensure a thoughtful and collaborative wind-down of the program through the end of 2026.”
Rogerson at UWPHI said the organization’s work is rooted in their long-term tracking of health data and information.
“We know that that work to realize that vision is not done,” she said. “We are still navigating and determining our next steps, but we hope to continue the work as much as possible for as long as possible. We know that communities, policy makers, students, lawmakers, rely on data- informed strategies and narrative change strategies, to advance work related to health and equity.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2025-Johnathan-Sublet-1-1-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-04-08 13:11:26.396743

The confirmation came one week after officials announced a separate measles case in Pueblo, marking the first time in at least 12 years that the state has confirmed two active measles cases at the same time.
The infections come amid an alarming rise in measles outbreaks nationwide, including several clusters in west Texas and neighboring states that have caused at least two deaths of unvaccinated children. Falling rates of vaccination, fueled by anti-vaccine conspiracy theories like those spread by newly confirmed Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., have preceded many of those outbreaks.

In a press release, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment said the Denver case was confirmed in an unvaccinated Denver infant under one year old, who had recently traveled to Chihuahua, Mexico. Children are recommended to receive their first dose of the combined measles, mumps and rubella, or MMR, vaccine at between 12 and 15 months old.
“Infants under 12 months are especially vulnerable to measles because they are typically too young to be vaccinated,” Dr. Rachel Herlihy, Colorado’s deputy chief medical officer and state epidemiologist, said in a statement. “This case is a stark reminder that families traveling internationally should delay unnecessary travel or talk to their health care providers about early MMR vaccination for infants, especially when visiting areas with known measles outbreaks.”
The World Health Organization has linked several reported measles cases in Mexico to the Texas outbreak. The Pueblo resident infected with measles last month, an unvaccinated adult, had also recently traveled to Mexico, CDPHE officials said.
Measles is a highly contagious and often severe disease that causes symptoms including fever, cough and a characteristic rash. Cases in the U.S. plummeted following the introduction of a vaccine in the 1960s, and the recommended two doses of the MMR vaccine provide about 97% protection against infection.
Colorado had the nation’s sixth-lowest rate of MMR vaccine coverage for kindergarteners in the 2023-24 school year, with an estimated only 88.3% of kindergarten students vaccinated, according to federal data. While state law requires K-12 students to receive the MMR vaccine and five others, it allows for broad exemptions on medical or religious grounds.
People who visited the Denver Health Emergency Department between 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on April 6 may have been exposed to measles, CDPHE officials said. People who were exposed should monitor for symptoms for at least three weeks after exposure and avoid public gatherings, especially if they are unvaccinated.

(Getty Images)Legislation has been filed to eliminate a chief public defender’s right to push back against their dismissal, even as five such attorneys are in the middle of using that very process to hang on to their jobs. 

State Rep. Les Farnum, R-Sulphur, has proposed a bill that would remove the ability of a chief public defender to ask for an investigation and hearing on their termination when their job contract is not renewed. His measure appeared a few days before Monday’s hearing on the ending of state contracts with five chief public defenders from north and central Louisiana. It could derail their current challenge to these job losses. 
The chief defenders in danger of being terminated include Michlle AndrePont in Caddo Parish, Brett Brunson in Natchitoches Parish, Deirdre Fuller in Rapides Parish, Trisha Ward in Evangeline Parish and John Hogue, who works in Tensas, Madison and East Carroll parishes.
The Louisiana Public Defender Oversight Board has up to two months to decide whether those attorneys can keep their positions. Farnum’s proposal could thwart the process if it becomes law before that deadline. 

The bill will be considered in the Louisiana Legislature’s lawmaking session that starts Monday and lasts through June 3. Farnum did not respond to requests for comment sent to his phone and email address Friday and Monday. 

His legislation is only the latest in a years-long power struggle between State Public Defender Rémy Starns and the chiefs who manage local judicial district public defender offices and, in smaller districts, personally represent clients in court. 

Starns has sought more control over the chiefs since former Gov. John Bel Edwards named him state public defender in 2020. He helped push a state law change last year that shifted significant authority over the public defense system from the state public defender board to the position he holds. 

The new law also gave the governor greater influence over the public defense system. Gov. Jeff Landry now has more power over the public defender management board and the selection of the state public defender. He reappointed Starns to that job last summer. 
Yet legislators did not agree to give Landry and Starns all the control they initially wanted last year. In response to complaints primarily from the chief public defenders, they added language to place limitations on Starns’ authority when it came to this ability to fire chiefs and set their compensation.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

The Public Defender Oversight Board can still create guidelines for what the chiefs are paid and intervene if a chief alleges to have been fired for improper reasons, according to the law approved last year. 

A committee of the board called a hearing Monday as part of the process of reviewing whether Starns is trying to fire five chiefs inappropriately. The chiefs allege Starns is canceling their yearly contracts on July 1 because they have spoken out against him publicly in hearings with lawmakers and state public defender boards over the past few years. 

“They have opposed various things that he has done and have been very vocal about this opposition,” said Stephen Haedicke, a New Orleans attorney representing the five chiefs at Monday’s hearing. 

Starns contends the board does not have oversight power over his decision to let go of the five chiefs. 

Their contracts are not being renewed but, because they are not being fired in the middle of a contract cycle, the board cannot legally intervene on their behalf, Starns wrote to the board Friday. In the same letter, he described his own job responsibilities as “very broad and awesome.”

The state public defender was also visibly irritated Monday that and hearing had been called, in his own words, to deal with “agendas being driven by people who only care about themselves.”
Starns complained the meeting, which lasted less than two hours, conflicted with his schedule and was preventing him from hiring staff members before a state government employment freeze takes effect at the end of the week. 

He refused to answer most of the board members’ questions about the chiefs’ dismissals and left the hearing early before all the testimony was given. 
One question Starns declined to address was why he decided not to renew the contracts of the five chief public defenders, none of whom have been accused of poor performance or malfeasance in office.

Absent any other explanation, Haedicke suggested the decision not to renew the chief’s contracts was retaliation for their opposition to Starns’ policies. Such actions threaten the independence of the public defense system, in which attorneys are constitutionally obligated to fight the state on behalf of their clients, the attorney argued.

If Starns has the ability to end chiefs contracts unilaterally, then the new public defense management system enacted by the legislature and the governor last year becomes one of “political patronage,” he said. 
The governor attempted to exert his own influence over the board through a letter he sent March 27 in which he asked its members to “reexamine the focus of the board’s core mission.” 

While Landry doesn’t directly mention the dismissal of the five chiefs in his letter, he referenced a legal opinion Attorney General Liz Murrill’s staff issued at Starns’ request supporting the decision to end their five contracts. 
“These district defenders are lawyers under contract, not state employees. They enjoy more liberties under a contractual obligation than civil servants, and for that, they forfeit other protections,” Landry said in the letter, without mentioning the dispute over their dismissals. 

At the hearing, Haedicke characterized the legal brief from Murrill’s office, which is an advisory opinion and not legally binding, as deeply flawed. He said it ignored several aspects of the new public defender law, including the legal process the chiefs’ can use to challenge a dismissal.

“It has gaping holes in it that make it just inept,” Haedicke said.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 

Yet Landry’s letter also implied financial concerns were behind the dismissal of the chief public defenders and that their salaries were contributing to a “web of out-of-control expenditures” in the public defense system. 

The governor’s comments were in line with one of Starns’ primary complaints. The state public defender has repeatedly objected to compensation guidelines for chief public defenders that the board has voted to keep in place multiple times. 

Starns argues the compensation plan, which requires salary increases for many of the 37 public defender chiefs and costs around $1 million, is not something the public defender system can afford in its $48.8 million annual budget. 

The board voted in favor of the higher salaries, in part, because some chief public defenders had not received a raise or cost-of-living adjustment in well over a decade. An alternative compensation structure Starns offered would have also dramatically cut some chiefs’ pay by tens of thousands of dollars, which made board members uncomfortable. 

Still, Landry said the Louisiana Department of Government Efficiency – a state version of the Elon Musk-led federal cost-cutting initiative known as DOGE – would be scrutinizing chief public defender pay as part of a review of the state’s nearly $49 billion budget. 

“Any pay plan that focuses a district defender’s pay heavily on inflating their compensation with little to no correlation to what each particular district can actually afford or what is reasonable compensation given the characteristics of each district, is in violation,” Landry wrote.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Gavel-GettyImages-876701606-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-04-08 13:11:26.396743

Kennedy Jr.’s Southwest tour, a charter school in Gallup announced that it was expecting a ""special guest"" on Wednesday. Kennedy is pictured above during his Senate confirmation hearing. (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Even though U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has been unwilling to say where in New Mexico he will visit this week during a Southwest tour, a conservative charter school in Gallup announced Monday that a “special guest” in the “national spotlight” who appreciates the school’s approach to nutrition and physical fitness will be visiting Wednesday.
Juliane Hillock, principal at Hózhó Academy in Gallup, sent a letter Monday to staff and students that explains how the visit came about and expresses her hope that “this level of exposure will generate good will and support the work we are doing to benefit our students.” The letter obtained by Source New Mexico also notes that the school has been asked not to reveal the visitor’s identity.  
The academy is a publicly funded charter school with 667 students in grades K-11, affiliated with the Hillsdale network of charter schools and flagship university, Hillsdale College, in southern Michigan. The schools’ curricula emphasize the “centrality of the Western tradition in the study of history, literature, philosophy and the fine arts.” Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas called Hillsdale College a “shining city on a hill.”
According to Hillock’s letter, a woman with local ties who works in President Donald Trump’s orbit made the connection between the “special guest” and her hometown. That woman, Heidi Overton, was born and raised in the Gallup area, graduated from the University of New Mexico medical school and now serves as the deputy director of the White House Domestic Policy Council. 
Overton knows some Hózhó parents and is familiar with the school’s approach to nutrition and physical fitness, Hillock wrote. 
HHS Secretary Kennedy’s tour stop in New Mexico closed to the press

Overton “heard about the work we are doing in our (physical education) program modeled after the John F. Kennedy President’s Council on Physical Fitness,” Hillock wrote, “as well as how we have strived to offer the most nutritious meals for students, so she graciously offered to make this connection for us.”
Robert F. Kennedy’s visit to Gallup comes as at least one Indian Health Service building in the Navajo Nation border town is on a list of lease terminations proposed by the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. 
It also comes as prominent Indigenous leaders, including New Mexico gubernatorial candidate Deb Haaland, criticize Kennedy for deep cuts to services Indigenous patients rely on and for reassigning doctors to Indian Country who don’t have any background working with Native populations. 
It’s not clear whether Kennedy will visit any Indian Health Service locations in New Mexico or elsewhere. A spokesperson told Source New Mexico on Tuesday all his events here would be closed to the press, though his announced schedule includes visits to health centers, discussions with tribal leaders and a noon visit on Wednesday to a “Pre-K to 11th grade charter school that integrates healthy eating and physical fitness into its daily student life.” 
Kennedy’s visit seemed inappropriate to Eirena Begay, the parent of two children who attend or have attended Hózhó. In an interview Monday evening with Source New Mexico, she noted how important the COVID-19 vaccines were to stemming the tide of virus-related deaths among Navajo people. 
The Navajo Nation was, at one point, the national epicenter for the virus, where it caused at least 1,800 deaths. So Begay deeply disagrees with Kennedy’s vaccine skepticism.
 “I definitely am not supportive of his views. I know that the vaccine is what saved us during a pandemic,” she said.
Her son, Colin Campbell, 16, said he ultimately left Hózhó because it felt like the teachers were trying to push him to go to Hillsdale College and because he thought he had more coursework options at another school. 
He took classes like Latin and history at Hózhó, he said. He recalls that his history teacher wore a Make America Great Again hat all day once at school, but said he really liked his math teacher. 
He said the PE class, which is modeled after RFK Jr.’s uncle’s program and is a reason for his visit, was more intense than those at public schools. In the early 1960s, a council John F. Kennedy convened created nationwide curriculum to encourage physical fitness, and later became the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports. 
The academy lays out its philosophy on physical fitness in a program manual on its website, suggesting that high rates of obesity and diabetes made Native Americans more susceptible to the COVID-19 virus. 
The other thing that made PE at Hózhó different, Campbell said, was the shorts. 
“It was kind of like a more active PE, I guess, more harder,” he said. “The only thing that I thought about it was the little, like, hierarchy of shorts.”
Different physical feats earned points, he said, and the more points a student received, the better the shorts got. The best colors are gold, he said, and the worst is gray.
  The “hierarchy of shorts,” as Colin Campbell calls it, at the Hózhó Academy, according to its program manual. (Screenshot courtesy program manual)
As for the food, he said the school took efforts to make it both tasty and nutritious, with mixed results. The pizza, for example, had carrots under the tomato sauce and cheese. 
“The food’s bad, because I guess they try to make it healthy,” he said. 
Hillock did not respond to a request for comment Tuesday morning about Kennedy’s visit or to respond to Campbell’s opinion on the food, among other questions. A spokesperson for RFK also did not respond to a request for comment.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)A proposal to limit development in state parks and ensure maximum public scrutiny of changes to their management plans won unanimous approval in a Florida House committee Tuesday.
The development gave hope to environmentalists and those who enjoy state public parks that this legislation can become law this year.
The bill (HB 209), sponsored by Ocala Republican John Snyder, is called the “State Park Preservation Act.” It represents a legislative response to the stunning plan that surfaced seemingly out of nowhere last summer by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP) to construct lodges, golf courses, pickleball courts and disc golf courses in nine state parks. 
That proposal ignited mass protests throughout the state and quickly went away. 
The bill would require all state parks or preserves to be managed in a manner “that provides the greatest combination of benefits to the public and the land’s natural resources.”
In addition, it explicitly says that state parks or preserves must be managed for conservation-based recreational uses; public access and related amenities, including roads, parking areas, walkways, and visitor centers; and scientific research, including archeology. 
“Such uses must be managed in a manner that is compatible with and that ensures the conservation of the state’s natural resources by minimizing impacts to undisturbed habitat and using disturbed upland regions to the maximum extent practical,” the bill says. 
“To ensure the protection of state park resources, the bill prohibits sporting facilities that cause substantial harm to the natural resources, native habitats, or archeological or historical sites within state parks, including, but not limited to, golf courses, tennis courts, pickleball courts, ball fields, or other similar facilities from being constructed in state parks.”
Amendment
Dozens of organizations and businesses had registered concerns about certain provisions of the legislation, including language that environmentalists said would create loopholes that could be allow unintended development.
In response, Snyder amended his bill on Tuesday, with language that now says the state Division of Recreation and Parks “may not authorize uses or construction activities, including the building or alteration of structures, within a state park which may cause significant harm to the resources of the state park. Any use or any construction activity must be conducted in a manner that avoids impacts to a state park’s critical habitat and natural and historical resources.”
The changes drew  support from members of those same environmental groups who earlier expressed concerns about the bill’s direction.
Chadwick Leonard of 1000 Friends of Florida said the amendment “addresses several concerns of about 70 organizations who signed on to a letter earlier on in this session.”
“Floridians love state parks. They love the access to nature that they provide. They love the solitude,” said Eve Samples of Friends of the Everglades. “They did not love the proposals that emerged last summer to develop our state parks with harmful development like golf courses and lodges.”
Pinellas County Democratic Rep. Lindsay Cross called the bill is a rare instance when the public shifted the Legislature to effect positive change.
“We don’t always see that,” she said. “When you’re an environmentalist and you love conservation, you’re often on the losing end and you have to continue to fight over and over again.”
Momentum
Miami-Dade County Democrat Ashley Gantt gave praise to Rep. Snyder.
“You served our country as a Marine, so you protected us as Americans, and now you’re protecting our state parks.”
In addition to some of the bill’s language, environmental groups over the past week made public concerns about whether the measure would pass at all this session.
The Senate companion (SB 80) was heard and passed unanimously in its one and only committee nearly two months ago during a pre-session committee week, and has not moved since.
Snyder’s bill in the House hadn’t been heard in a committee since the first week of session more than a month ago — but it is now headed to the House for a final vote.

In a 32-page decision, Circuit Judge Cotton Walker found no reason to block the $15 million in this year’s state budget for Hannibal Regional to build a radiation oncology center. The legislature is not a state agency and not bound by the law limiting when state agencies can appropriate or grant funds for health care facilities, Walker wrote.
“State agencies are created by the legislature and are within the executive branch,” Walker wrote. “The legislature itself is not a state agency. It is its own branch of government.”
The lawsuit was filed by Tina Binder of Macon County after she spoke to the lobbyist for Community Health Systems, owner of Northeast Missouri  Regional Medical Center in Kirksville. It tests the limits of the legislature’s ability to earmark appropriations using definitions for counties and agencies that are so specific that there is only one possible recipient. The funding was one of about 400 earmarks lawmakers included in the current budget.
The lawsuit challenged whether Hannibal Regional, for example, is “located in more than one county.” 
Walker noted that Hannibal is a community that straddles the Ralls and Marion county line and “the evidence confirms unequivocally that (Hannibal Regional) has business operations and assets in more than one county.”
The main question in the case was whether the legislature could set aside money for a new service that has not been given a “certificate of need” by the Missouri Health Facilities Review Committee. 
Attorneys for Binder argued that the legislature had no power to appropriate the money if the committee had not issued a certificate of need.
Lawsuit tests Missouri legislature’s power to earmark funds for health-care construction

In Missouri, anyone proposing to construct or expand a hospital, or purchase new equipment, with a cost exceeding $1 million must obtain a certificate of need. The certificate of need program is intended to prevent expensive duplication of services.
When the appropriation was made Hannibal Regional did not have a certificate of need. It obtained the certificate on Oct. 1. 
The legislature is not bound by certificate of need law, Walker wrote.
“Even if it were bound by this statute, its appropriation was to the Missouri Department of Social Services, which did not require a certificate of need,” he wrote.
The lawsuit stalled work on a contract to deliver the money to Hannibal Regional and during the December trial, Hannibal Regional attorney Matt Turner said the case needed to be finished by June 30 or the appropriation would lapse with the end of the fiscal year.
The budget for the coming year, approved last week in the Missouri House, included a reappropriation to make the money available for another year.
Hannibal Regional intends to purchase a linear accelerator and build a facility to house it on a 240-acre property it purchased in 2022 in Kirksville. Attorneys for Binder tried to convince Walker that a memorandum of understanding with the city, where Hannibal Regional said it would open a hospital or buy the existing one if it became available, meant the certificate of need should be for a hospital instead of only the accelerator.
Walker wrote that the memorandum does not make the building that will house the accelerator a “health care facility” requiring its own certificate of need. Only the equipment requires the certificate of need, he wrote.
Walker also questioned whether Binder was truthful in the affidavit she filed stating she objected to the spending item based on “knowledge of the facts” regarding appropriations, veto considerations and certificate of need applications.
Under questioning at the December trial, Binder admitted she had limited knowledge of how state appropriations work, the regulatory oversight for building new health care facilities or other key issues in the case.
“I don’t understand the legal jargon without having it in front of me,” Binder said. “I am just a regular old taxpayer concerned about taxpayer dollars.”
That, Walker wrote, shows Binder’s affidavit contains information she did not personally know.
“At trial,” Walker wrote, “she confirmed she had no firsthand knowledge of the information contained in her affidavit and that all the information in her affidavit came from her attorneys or from someone else.”

The House Homeland Security and Military and Veterans Affairs Committee took up House Bill 133, “NC Farmland and Military Protection Act.” About an hour later, the Senate Agriculture, Energy, and Environment Committee approved the upper chamber’s counterpart, Senate Bill 394, “Prohibit Foreign Ownership of NC Land.”
Both measures now head to subsequent panels — House Commerce and Economic Development and Senate Judiciary, respectively.
At a time of rocky international relations due to the Trump administration’s tariffs, the legislation could signify a move toward increased tension with foreign countries.
HB 133, sponsored by Reps. Jennifer Balkcom (R-Henderson), Neal Jackson (R-Moore, Randolph), Jeff Zenger (R-Forsyth), and John Bell (R-Goldsboro), would prohibit “adversarial” foreign governments from purchasing, acquiring, or leasing agricultural land in North Carolina, according to the bill text.
The restrictions would also apply to land situated within a 75-mile radius of a military installation — a number influenced by national defense recommendations, Balkcom said — such as Fort Bragg near Fayetteville. A complete list of applicable installations is outlined in the bill text.
“If it was up to me, I’d do the entire state,” Balkcom said. “But this doesn’t infringe on private property rights. You can sell it to anybody but a foreign national that’s an adversary against the United States.”
Rep. Celeste Cairns (R-Carteret, Craven) asked for clarification on the bill’s parameters. She asked if people would be able to sell property to individual citizens of the “adversarial” countries without connection to their government.
Balkcom responded in the affirmative. In response to a question from Rep. Wyatt Gable (R-Onslow) about how the “adversarial” governments are defined, she said there’s guidance from the U.S. Department of Defense.
Although the bill doesn’t list specific countries, it refers to governments subject to the International Traffic in Arms Regulations.
Over in the upper chamber, Sens. Bob Brinson (R-Beaufort, Craven, Lenoir), Bobby Hanig (R-Bertie, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Gates, Hertford, Northampton, Pasquotank, Perquimans, Tyrrell), and Timothy Moffitt (R-Henderson, Polk, Rutherford) serve as the primary sponsors for SB 394.
The measure explicitly refers to the “adversarial” nations by name: China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia.
Brinson described the legislation as a state effort to protect national security, because “food security is national security.”
“The key purpose of this bill is to both safeguard our agricultural integrity and to protect our national security,” he said. “This bill ensures that North Carolina farmland does not come under international adversarial control, and also prevents adversarial nations from acquiring land near sensitive military installations.”
SB 394 is more restrictive than its House counterpart. The proposal bars the prohibited foreign parties from making claims to land situated within a 25-mile radius of a military installation or land underneath special use airspace as designated by the Federal Aviation Administration.
Sen. Lisa Grafstein (D-Wake) pointed out there is a growing population of Chinese immigrants and Chinese Americans in the state. She asked if the bill would ban someone from purchasing land if they are a legal resident of the U.S. with Chinese citizenship.
“If they’re a resident alien of the U.S., they have the same right to acquire or hold land as a citizen, as long as they’re a resident in the state,” Brinson said. “As long as they are a legal resident alien, they should have the same land ownership rights as a citizen.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Farm-harvester-USDA-photo.jpg,,,2025-04-08 12:25:59.348784

Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said during Senate debate Monday that the bill will provide “responsible and sustainable funding” for Iowa schools, with the package providing $238.1 million in increased funding for Iowa’s K-12 education system from the previous year — when including funding for public K-12 schools, charter schools and the state’s Education Savings Account program — as a part of a total $4.2 billion in K-12 education spending.

The House approval comes after lengthy negotiations between the Republicans in the two chambers over education spending. Senate Republicans initially proposed a 2% SSA rate with no additional funding components, in line with Gov. Kim Reynolds’ recommendation at the beginning of the 2025 legislative session. But House Republicans proposed a slightly higher 2.25% SSA rate, alongside other funding components — some of which made it into the final bill with some changes.
The House GOP proposal included a $10 SCPP raise and an unlimited appropriation for transportation equity aid payment to address existing inequities, components that were altered but included in the Senate amendment. Other funding aspects, like a $22.6 million one-time appropriation to supplement school funding in fiscal year 2026, were not included.
House Democrats criticized Republicans, who control both chambers, for not reaching an agreement on school funding earlier. Lawmakers have a self-imposed deadline to pass school funding for the next year within 30 days of the governor’s budget being released. That deadline passed in February — and school districts’ deadlines to release a budget proposal for the upcoming year passed in March.
Rep. Larry McBurney, D-Urbandale, said the 2% SSA rate will not provide adequate funding to Iowa schools, and will lead to property tax increases in many Iowa communities. Under the proposal, Democrats said 159 Iowa school districts will be on the budget guarantee, a process increasing property taxes that is triggered when school districts’ funding obligations cannot be met by SSA.
McBurney said House Republicans “ultimately caved” to the Senate’s lower school funding proposal, and called for his GOP colleagues in the House to not support the amended bill.
“If we’re going to do it, let’s do it right,” McBurney said. “Heck, you guys have already missed the timeline by two months. What’s another few weeks to get it right for our public schools?”
Rep. Dan Gehlbach, R-Urbandale, the bill’s floor manager, pushed back against Democrats’ criticisms, saying “House Republicans didn’t just accept the first offer on the table, we fought for more.”
“This plan isn’t everything we initially voted on, but it’s a hard-fought victory that moves us forward, and I’m proud of the work our leadership did to get this across the finish line,” Gehlbach said.
Gehlbach also said there will be more school funding discussions in the future, saying he hopes to run a measure in 2025 that would provide a $14 million standing appropriation for paying paraeducators in Iowa’s K-12 school system.

(Kansas Reflector screen capture of state board's livestream)TOPEKA — A policy retreat offered the Kansas Board of Education opportunity to explore how local school boards could be liberated from much of the state’s educational bureaucracy by reshaping standards to emphasize instruction in the basics of reading, writing and math.
Conservatives on the 10-member state Board of Education expressed support Monday in personal and philosophical terms for a shift toward fundamental subjects. During the informal gathering at a Topeka office building, right-leaning members said time had come to curtail state mandates bearing down on 284 school districts serving nearly 500,000 students.
Cathy Hopkins, who serves as chair of the state Board of Education and represents a district covering much of western Kansas, said the board was guilty of piling burdensome responsibilities on teachers and administrators. It could be necessary to jettison a large portion of state mandates to improve the ability of local districts to deliver for students in fundamental subject areas, she said.
Her personal agenda for the upcoming two years centered on helping students excel in reading and writing because prowess in those core areas would create an educational ripple effect on student learning.
“How do we get back to that? The core,” said Leavenworth state board member Danny Zeck, who serves as the board’s vice chair. “Get rid of all this Barbra Streisand stuff that we’re doing. What we’re doing now … is not working. We need to get down to the basic stuff for these kids — that they can read and write and do arithmetic and maybe there’s some computer skills and go from there.”
State board member Debby Potter of Garden Plain said accreditation standards for public schools set by the state board had to be condensed.
“There’s a whole range of people and they don’t all have to know math at the level of every other one to be successful,” Potter said.
She indicted the state board should be operating at a 20,000-foot level in terms of academic directives. Local school boards should be allowed to fill in details of academic standards to reflect the character or needs of individual districts.
“God made us to want to learn and gain something we don’t have. All we have to do is provide the tools,” said Hutchinson board member Dennis Hershberger.
He said young children were being harmed by parents who gave them a PlayStation gaming device instead of a box of Crayons. He said he yearned for the past when a jar of pencils on a shelf or a chalkboard at the front of the classroom were keys to the educational experience.
 
Peering into future
Randy Watson, commissioner of the Kansas State Department of Education, began the policy retreat by emphasizing the value of public service performed by the state Board of Education members. He asked the eight board members in attendance to consider policy amendments that could be accomplished in the next two years, but requested each be framed in terms of children and their families.
“This isn’t about trying to bait people,” Watson said. “All of you not only serve different parts of the state, you come at this job from a different perspective.”
He reminded board members of Article 6, Section 2 of the Kansas Constitution that declared the Kansas Legislature “shall provide for a state Board of Education, which shall have general supervision of public schools.” And, Article 6, Section 6 of the document: “The Legislature shall make suitable provision for finance of the educational interests of the state.”
Interpretation of those constitutional duties has prompted major legal battles every 20 years of so that ultimately were addressed by the Kansas Supreme Court, he said.
“You have a lot of authority, as does a local board,” Watson said. “What does a kindergartner need? What does a third-grader need? How do you build that? We can’t do everything.”
Politically moderate members of the state Board of Education said during the retreat in Topeka that Kansas ought to maintain a central role in the academic evolution of school districts statewide. They said the state board’s mission of delivering educational opportunity to all students had to remain a cornerstone of Kansas’ pre-kindergarten through high school public education system.
There was discussion of students’ demand for instruction in life skills, which have been designed by the state board to prepare graduates for a career or college.
 
‘Our own story’
Board member Betty Arnold of Wichita said compaction of instruction to reading, writing and math to the exclusion of other parts of a person’s education ignored reality because many students arrived in public school buildings ill-equipped to learn. Time devoted to mentally preparing students to succeed in school and life shouldn’t be viewed as an extravagance, she said.
“It’s more difficult to teach a kid who does not believe in him or herself,” Arnold said. “No students come to us the same way.”
Hershberger, the Hutchinson state board member, said he was “old-school” and recalled how he struggled emotionally as a child to overcome barriers to reading aloud in class. Students experience real education when they accomplished something they didn’t know they were capable of doing, he said.
“Every child unless there is some mental disability … has the capability of learning to read no matter what their background is,” Hershberger said.
In response, Arnold said it would be wrong for a state board member to transfer personal school experiences from decades ago to decisions about what was necessary to educate children in this era and the future.
“We have to be able to live outside of our own story,” Arnold said.
Melanie Haas, a state board member from Overland Park, said state board placed proper emphasis on a commitment to individual plans of study for students as well as issues related to values and morality. She said the Kansas Education Systems Accreditation program, which was crafted so district-level decisions were made about improving educational opportunity, was in place.
“We’re right in the middle of it. We’re doing it,” Haas said.
In terms of statewide reform, she said, it was imperative the state board concentrate on improving school culture by minimizing friction between teachers and administrators.
“When you have a great administrator who gives autonomy to those in school, you see that in student success,” Haas said. “When you have someone who is micromanaging and telling teachers what to do, and ruling, I think that’s where you see these cultures start to break down.”
She said surveys showed students welcomed instruction in life skills tied to personal, academic and vocational success, including social-emotional learning, practical skills for daily living and character development.
Zeck, the northeast Kansas member of the state board, said he was frustrated with emphasis on life skills in public schools.
“If we’re going to talk about life skills, I would like it to be black and white and not a whole bunch of gray,” Zeck said. “If we’re going to simplify things, then we need to simplify them and not have all this gray stuff.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Hopkins-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-08 12:25:59.348784

(Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)The chair of the Republican National Committee said Monday evening he believes recent chaos in global stock markets was an “overreaction” to President Donald Trump’s new tariffs.
“I think there’s a lot of false equivocation that the market equals the economy,” argued Michael Whatley, who was elevated to the national post by Trump after previously serving as head of the North Carolina GOP. “It doesn’t.”
Whatley’s comments Monday came during an event at NC State University, held by the conservative campus group Turning Point USA — which grew contentious at times as he defended the administration’s policies in front of a student crowd that included multiple vocal protesters.
Stock futures bounced Tuesday morning after news of Trump’s wide-ranging tariffs caused days of steep losses and volatility across global markets. Multiple questions from students addressed costs and the economy; one was spotted looking at the S&P 500’s daily chart on his laptop as the state GOP chairman, Jason Simmons, addressed the room.
“I am not panicking” about the markets, Whatley told the crowd of around 50 at Talley Student Union. He said he believed they “will rebound” as the world adjusts to the new policy (multiple prominent trade partners, including the E.U. and China, have vowed to retaliate with additional tariffs of their own). And he urged students to take a longer, and wider, view of the administration’s trade policies.
“You probably want to look at that not just in a vacuum,” Whatley said, but rather as an “overall strategy to bring manufacturing back to the U.S.”
Students’ questions of RNC chair: Immigration, housing and free speech
Attendees at Monday’s Turning Point event, most of whom were students, quizzed Whatley on a range of topics — including the GOP’s approach to housing, the administration’s mass deportation policy and concerns about free speech.
And throughout the event, a group of students there to protest the event frequently set off noisemakers and ended the event shouting at Whatley.
One student, who said he led a campus group focused on real estate, asked how the party could focus on making housing affordable. (Whatley said reducing the cost of materials and taking down building regulations were key.) Another asked about potential shortages of people on visas, concerned about the impact on agricultural workforce. (Whatley said people should view the current phase of immigration enforcement as “phase one.”)
Multiple protesters urged Whatley to answer for reports of migrants who are in the U.S. legally and do not have criminal charges also being caught up in deportation operations. And they asked him to comment on two NC State students’ visas being revoked last week.
“I don’t know anything about the students here,” Whatley said. But he defended the administration’s immigration enforcement broadly, and said that “folks who are over here on visas are not citizens.”
The Q&A ended on a tense note, as protesters grew increasingly agitated with Whatley’s answers and shouted criticisms of the administration and GOP’s actions toward pro-Palestinian protesters. Those protesters, many of whom are students, have reportedly been under scrutiny by immigration authorities and private groups for possible deportation.
“You don’t care, and that’s the problem,” one shouted, as another held up a sign reading “free speech unless it’s free Palestine.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/IMG_8252-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 12:25:59.348784

A news release from U.S. Rep. Teresa Leger Fernández, who represents the state’s 3rd Congressional District, cited Source New Mexico’s reporting on Monday that the Trump administration is reversing the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service’s decision to protect the Upper Pecos Watershed from new mining operations.
The move came several weeks after the agency canceled a Feb. 17 public hearing on the administrative process to remove that area from new mining for 20 years, which the Biden Administration had pursued in the final weeks in office. A temporary pause on mining had been in place since December.
A statement from Leger Fernández, U.S. Melanie Stansbury from the 1st Congressional District and U.S. Senators Martin Heinrich and Ben Ray Luján called the Trump administrations decision to reverse the withdrawal “disturbing and insulting, especially after they canceled the only public meeting on the proposal. This is a rural community that overwhelmingly supports protecting the Pecos River. The Trump administration just blatantly disregarded that, and the value of the Pecos River with it.”
The Pecos Watershed Protection Act would permanently withdraw all federally managed minerals in the watershed from development. — preventing the leasing, patent, or sale of all publicly owned minerals. The bill has been introduced in every Congress since 2020.
The area is home to the Terrero Mining disaster from 1991, during which floodwaters breached a defunct mine and sent mining tailing sludge downriver. The spill killed tens of thousands of fish and cleanup continues to this day.
New Mexico Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard in March signed an executive order banning mineral mining on approximately 2,500 acres of state trust land in the Upper Pecos Watershed that will remain in place through 2045.
The Village of Pecos, Santa Fe County and San Miguel County have passed resolutions in support of the federal legislation protecting the area.
“The Trump administration won’t have the last word,” the federal delegations’ statement continued. “We will continue to push for permanent protection of the watershed through our Pecos Watershed Protection Act. New Mexicans deserve clean water free from harmful mining pollution.

(Photo by Ariana Figueroa/States Newsroom)Prosecutors could seek the death penalty for people convicted of trafficking a child aged 12 or younger or someone with a severe mental disability under a bill heading to the House floor.
Seminole Republican Rep. Berny Jacques told lawmakers Tuesday that previous U.S. Supreme Court rulings declaring such punishment unconstitutional shouldn’t persuade them to vote against HB 1283. Most agreed, with only two Democrats voting against the proposal during its third and final hearing in the Judiciary Committee.
  Pinellas County Republican Rep. Berny Jacques via Florida House of Representatives
Jacques labeled the 2008 ruling in Kennedy v. Louisiana — the 5-4 decision declaring that a Louisiana law allowing for the death penalty in cases of child rape violated Eighth Amendment — “vile.”
“Some of the most horrendous Supreme Court cases in our nation’s history was well-settled law,” Jacques said. “I think of Plessy v. Ferguson; I think of the Dred Scott decision. Those were all well-settled law. Thank goodness they were overturned.”
In 2023, Florida lawmakers also set out to challenge the court with a law that established the death penalty for rape of minors under 12. Similar to the 2023 measure, under Jacques’ proposal only eight out of 12 jurors would need to recommend the death sentence.
Democratic Reps. LaVon Bracy Davis of Ocoee and Michael Gottlieb of Davie opposed the bill Tuesday.
“I will say, in a case like this with someone that has participated in sex trafficking with a minor, that life in prison may be the better charge as opposed to death, and I think that person perhaps would be punished more egregiously with having to spend their life incarcerated,” Bracy Davis said.
Riverview Republican Rep. Danny Alvarez said that children’s lives should matter more than what the Supreme Court thinks.
“We tell the Supreme Court what’s coming, and if they want to overrule us, that’s fine,” he said. “Let them look them in the eyes, but I will not stand here and allow children to be hurt and then make the excuse that we’re just gonna vote down because the Supreme Court said.”
The Senate companion, SB 1804, needs approval from two more committees before reaching the floor.
The Legislature’s trend of challenging the Supreme Court on the death penalty continued during one of this year’s special sessions on immigration. Lawmakers moved to establish a mandatory death penalty for immigrants without legal status who are convicted of murder or child rape. The Supreme Court deemed mandatory death penalties unconstitutional in the 5-4 decision of Woodson v. North Carolina in 1976.

“No, I’m not gonna run,” he told radio host Jack Heath on his show, “The Pulse of NH.”
This comes after feverish speculation from analysts and insiders over whether Sununu, a fixture of GOP politics in New Hampshire with a history of electoral success, would enter the race. It also follows President Donald Trump expressing his support for Sununu should he enter the race.
“I hope he runs,” Trump, who had a complicated relationship with Sununu during his governorship, told reporters on Air Force One on Sunday. “I think he’ll win that seat.”
Trump said the two met at the Oval Office in Washington, D.C., where they discussed it.
No Republican has announced a campaign for the seat yet, but on the Democratic side, U.S. Rep. Chris Pappas, who represents New Hampshire’s 1st Congressional District, began his campaign last week. U.S. Rep. Maggie Goodlander, a freshman representing the state’s 2nd Congressional District, is also openly considering a bid for the seat.
The race for the Senate seat became wide open in March when Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, who has held the seat since 2008, announced she would not seek reelection in 2026.
Sununu ended his four-term tenure as governor with high approval ratings in January after deciding not to seek reelection. His governorship was characterized by tax cuts and reduced regulations, with a governing style unlike that of Trump.
He was succeeded by Gov. Kelly Ayotte, a former U.S. senator herself.
The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which is looking to maintain the GOP’s majority in the Senate, has deemed this a toss-up race and said its internal polling was favorable for Republicans.
“The NRSC continues to believe Republicans are going to win New Hampshire in 2026,” Nick Puglia, a regional press secretary for the NRSC, said in a statement. “While Democrats duke it out in a race to the left, we are excited about the number of candidates we are talking to who appreciate the privilege of representing Granite Staters in the Senate and are ready to build winning campaigns.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/sununuprimary-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-08 12:25:59.348784

The proposal (HB 1581) is sponsored by Republicans James Buchanan from Sarasota and Mike Giallombardo from Lee County.
Buchanan told the House State Affairs Committtee that there numerous reasons why such legislation is needed, saying that this is “not a bill in search of a problem.”
Rep. Giamlombardo says his motivation was what happened in the city of Cape Coral in 2023.
That’s when the Cape Coral City Council put a proposal on a consent agenda without discussion by which member gave themselves a stipend that would have nearly doubled their salaries — an extra $3,333 a month for members and for the mayor an extra $5,000, according to the Cape Coral Breeze. A new group of council members repealed the bonuses last fall.
Additionally, the Tampa City Council last summer approved an almost 40% pay raise for themselves, from $54,000 to $75,000.
The House State Affairs Committee approved the bill, 22-0, and it now goes to the House floor for a vote. 
However, its companion bill in the Senate, sponsored by Sarasota Republican Joe Gruters (SB 1762), has yet to be heard in any committee.

Kay Ivey announced Tuesday morning, with two-thirds of the applicants not attending the state’s public schools. 
Funds from the voucher-like program can be used for education-related expenses, including private school tuition. A family can receive up to $7,000 in state income tax credits per eligible student in a participating school and up to $2,000 for a student that is homeschooled. 
The money for the program comes out of the Education Trust Fund, where nearly all state income tax goes. Under the law, legislators must set $100 million aside for the program starting with the FY 2026 ETF budget, which goes into effect on Oct. 1.

“The CHOOSE Act, Alabama’s education savings account program, will allow more taxpaying Alabama families the opportunity to choose a school that meets their child’s individual needs,” Ivey said in a statement.
Ivey’s office said the 22,167 applications represented 36,873 students. Of those, 24,506 students (66.4%) come from private school (15,436) or are homeschooled (9,070.) The office said 10,287 (28%) applications were filed for students in public and charter schools. 



Of the public school applicants, the governor’s office said 9,788 came from traditional public schools and 499 from charter schools.
Mobile County, which has the state’s largest public school system, had the largest number of applicants, with 5,056. Jefferson County had 4,183; Montgomery had 3,849 and Madison had 2,395.
Applications to the program are currently limited to special needs students and those making under 300% of the poverty line, about $79,950 for a family of three. The program will be open to all applicants starting in 2027, without any income limits.
According to the Education Data Initiative, the average private school tuition in Alabama is $8,289 per student per year.
Democrats and a handful of Republicans from rural areas opposed the law last year, expressing concerns that it could drain the ETF and exacerbate de facto segregation in the state’s public schools. 
Whitney Miller-Nichols, director of governmental relations for the Council for Leaders in Alabama Schools, an organization that provides professional development, networking opportunities, communications, legal support, legislative monitoring and recognition programs for its members, said Tuesday that the organization is frustrated that a fund designed to fund public education is not being used for public education.
“Two-thirds of the people applying or not in public schools, which is what we have seen in other states,” Miller-Nichols said in a phone interview. “Our concern is it takes $100 million out of the Education Trust Fund. And the Education Trust Fund was established in support of public education for Alabama students.”
Miller-Nichols also said the application numbers could be misleading. 
“I will point out that the other thing we don’t know at this point is how many of those applicants meet the income qualification,” she said. “The net might be wider than maybe the program administrators intended, because people are applying even if they exceed the income criteria.”
According to the release, families will be notified in May if they have been awarded the funds and will be able to start using their education savings account in July for approved expenses. Gina Maiola, a spokeswoman for Ivey, said that each applicant will either receive $7,000 or $2,000 for their ESA. Of the 36,000 applicants, about 16,000 (43%) students will receive an ESA from the CHOOSE Act.
“Based on the strong response, we fully expect the $100 million to be utilized to support our taxpaying Alabama families,” she said in an email.

Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear has launched a podcast that he hopes will “bridge divides and foster understanding” in America. 
The first episode of The Andy Beshear Podcast, released Tuesday morning, featured the governor interviewing John Morgan, founder of personal injury law firm Morgan & Morgan and a Democratic megadonor. The discussion focused on national news of the week — topics such as Trump administration officials using a Signal group chat to discuss plans to bomb Yemen. The governor also learned how to use some Gen Z slang from his teenage son, Will. 
Beshear’s launch of a podcast comes as national Democratic figures aim to enter internet spaces dominated by right-wing personalities. 
“Remember, it might be a tough world, but we’re always better when we choose hope over anger, when we choose love over hate, and when we get together with friends to try to process all that weight that’s on our shoulders,” Beshear said when closing his show. “I still believe that people out there are good, and we’re going to see people waking up all across the country wanting to do the right thing.”
The podcast aims to be “where real conversations bridge divides and foster understanding,” according to its website. Beshear will host episodes weekly in which he “engages in honest conversations with guests from diverse backgrounds — leaders, educators, innovators, creators, and everyday people with extraordinary stories.” 
Guests on the show will have some ground rules, including to be themselves, talk like a real human being, no debating reality, tell their why and have fun. “You be you, boo,” Beshear said while explaining the rules. 
For the inaugural episode, which was free of advertising, Beshear asked viewers to donate to a charity of their choice and share the group they supported in the comments. 
Beshear’s podcast isn’t the first to be hosted by a governor who could be a contender for the 2028 Democratic presidential nomination.. Earlier this year, California Gov. Gavin Newsom began his show as a way to explore the MAGA movement’s motivations, but it has gained criticism across the political spectrum, including from Democrats and Beshear. 
Last month, Beshear told reporters that Newsom “bringing on different voices is great,” but he drew the line at giving a platform to Steve Bannon, a prominent ally of Republican President Donald Trump.
“Steve Bannon espouses hatred and anger and even at some points violence, and I don’t think we should give him oxygen on any platform — ever, anywhere,” Beshear said at the time.

However, Beshear’s inaugural podcast performance fell flat for some viewers. Republican Party of Kentucky spokesperson Andy Westberry questioned Beshear’s use of “You be you, boo” and talk of Nike Air Force 1s. 
“If Andy Beshear wants to be authentic, he should start by not trying to dress and talk like a 20-year-old. This podcast is nothing more than a stale attempt at emulating California Gov. Gavin Newsom after seeing the publicity he received for launching his own,” Westberry said. “But instead of having difficult conversations with opposing views or reflecting on where Democrats went wrong in ’24, he’s playing it safe by bringing on Democratic bundlers and close friends. This podcast is going to fall flat — just like his ‘aw, shucks’ persona does on the national stage.” 
Beshear announced his podcast on social media over the weekend. Louisville-based Media Pros Production is the company behind the production, according to a clapperboard featured in the video. 
Kendall Norris, the media and communications director for Beshear’s podcast, said in an email the production for the show is privately financed and owned by AB Media. The podcast is not affiliated with Beshear’s official role or funded by state resources, she said. AB Media was formed in January, according to business records filed with the secretary of state. 
The Andy Beshear Podcast is available on all major platforms, including Spotify, Apple Podcasts, YouTube and iHeartRadio.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screen-Shot-2025-04-08-at-11.14.47-AM-1024x518.png,,,2025-04-08 12:25:59.348784

However, both officials say the state legislature will have to put politics aside to get it done.
Michigan House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has mandated that as soon as the House returns next week from a break, getting bills for a state Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund over to the Senate by the end of April is the highest priority for the chamber.
The fund would dedicate $75 million in the state budget and millions more in sales tax revenue to fund public safety in local communities across the state, allowing police departments to hire more officers and invest in community violence intervention programs.
Law enforcement officials from various cities and counties participated in a roundtable discussion Monday in Detroit on different needs in their communities and how they’d be better equipped to address them with the fund. And as the partisanly split Michigan legislature in the coming months will hammer out the details of the next state budget, Hall said this investment in crime reduction is paramount to the state.

“Listening today to our chiefs of police, if we get them the resources that they need, they’re ready to hire more officers, they’re ready to buy the equipment, and they’re ready to patrol the streets and to ensure that we bring our violent crime rates down,” Hall said.
For many years, it’s been rare to see a Republican Party leader in Detroit, Mayor of Detroit Mike Duggan said, but having Hall in the city, eager to recognize it as an asset to be invested in, shows a turn in the tides of underinvestment in Detroit, which historically has the highest crime rate in the state.
Duggan has caught vitriol from Democrats as a “fox in the henhouse” for shifting off his Democrat label in favor of running as an independent candidate for the 2026 election for governor, a move that is expected to split votes with the Democratic candidate on the ballot.

But Duggan said Monday he’s had enough of politics holding up progress in Lansing and he’s eager to see the Public Safety and Violence Prevention Fund, which had bipartisan support last legislative session, get across the finish line with even more funding this session, despite concerns that the Democratic-led Senate may hold up the bills in order to negotiate for their policy priorities with the House.
“…Senate Democrats voted for this without an add-on bill the last vote of the session in December. All you do is vote the same way you voted the last time. So hopefully the games are over and we’ll get this done,” Duggan said.
There will be metrics for effectiveness in the utilization of the fund’s dollars, Hall said. Rather than focusing singularly on communities with high crime rates, the funds will be distributed and as communities utilize what they’re given, the allocation will be adjusted for those municipalities that create results in public safety.
It’s not always areas recognized for high crime rates that find themselves in need of public safety investment, Oakland County Sheriff Michael Bouchard said, noting the swift and robust response needed for a mass shooting at a splash pad in Rochester Hills, which is known for low crime rates.

Duggan and Detroit Police Chief Todd Bettison noted how effective community violence intervention programs have been in Detroit, with Duggan saying that amid a string of deadly shootings last summer at block parties, participants in those programs were instrumental in deterring violence ways and limiting the need for arrests.
“This Public Safety Trust Fund will make a tremendous difference. It will allow chiefs of police in various cities to be able to fund their initiatives to hire more officers, which I will do, and be able to invest in mental health and community initiatives such as violence intervention, which we know will reduce this crime,” Bettison said.

Michigan’s Senate ends its own break for the spring this week and though leadership from that chamber has remained quiet on the subject of the fund, their Democratic colleagues who are pushing for the legislation in the House are urging lawmakers to swiftly take up the bills.
Public safety is an every Michigander issue, Rep. Alabas Farhat (D-Dearborn) said. While there is plenty of talk in Lansing about the previous session and issues that divide the legislative chambers, Farhat said it’s time to take a step outside the rhetoric, “commit”, and get policies through that benefit all Michiganders.
“The longer we wait, the more likely homicides and people will die. It’s that simple. We give the folks that are in this room the money they need… they’re going to disrupt the crime,” Farhat said. “This is an issue that impacts every Michigander, whether you live in a blue district or a red district, whether sheriffs a Democrat or Republican, no matter where you live, you’re touched by this issue. So just get it done. Take the politics out of it. Get it done.”

As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high. A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. [&#8230;]","A 3D graphic representation of a spherical-shaped, measles virus particle, that was studded with glycoprotein tubercles (Alissa Eckert/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
 Alarm among experts

Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.
Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
 State responses

The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Nancy Mace publicly accused of being a sexual predator was arrested Tuesday on charges of stalking and sexual harassment, according to Charleston County jail records.

Nancy Mace talks to reporters at a Richland County GOP event on Jan. 27, 2025. (Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)One of the four men U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace publicly accused of being a sexual predator was arrested Tuesday on charges of stalking and sexual harassment, according to Charleston County jail records.
Eric Bowman, 45, turned himself in to Sullivan’s Island Police and was booked into the jail at 6:15 a.m. Tuesday.
Bowman, a Charleston entrepreneur, denied the allegations in a post to his X account Monday night.
He said the charges came from his estranged wife, who he claimed he has not spoken to since November 2023.
A spokesperson for the jail did not immediately return messages from the SC Daily Gazette. The Sullivan’s Island chief told the Gazette the department is working on a release.
Stalking is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, while first-degree harassment is a misdemeanor with a penalty of up to three years in jail and a $1,000 fine.
The charges come roughly two months after Mace’s stunning, hour-long speech Feb. 10 on the floor of the U.S. House, when she accused Bowman and three other men, including her ex-fiancé, of being sexual predators and committing “some of the most heinous crimes against women.”
All four men immediately and have repeatedly denied the claims.
Mace accuses 4 men, including ex-fiancé, of being sexual ‘predators.’ SLED is investigating.

The 1st District congresswoman posted Bowman’s mugshot on social media Tuesday morning — both her official House account and a separate account she uses for campaigning and personal posts.
“If you harm women and kids, you should face the full force of the law,” he wrote. “Eric Bowman, one of the men featured prominently in my floor speech, arrested this morning. I hope you get everything you deserve and more.”
She also re-tweeted an X post from the days following her floor speech, which mentions all four men, and added, “Just going to leave this right here.”
Brian Musgrave, one of the four men named in the speech, is suing Mace for libel and defamation and is using her social media as evidence.
The 37-page complaint against Mace, as well as several unnamed people accused of conspiring with her — identified only as “Jane/John Does” — will test the bounds of the “speech or debate” clause of the U.S. Constitution that shields members of Congress from lawsuits for what is said in either chamber.
Musgrave’s legal team argues that Mace’s protection does not extend outside the halls of Congress and especially not onto the internet.
“It does not transform the floor of Congress into a sanctuary for defamation, nor does it protect Congresswoman Mace’s extra-Congressional defamatory statements surrounding her speech,” reads the lawsuit.
Rep. Mace sued by 1 of the men she accused of being a sexual predator

Bowman said as recently as Monday on social media that likely won’t be the last lawsuit filed as a result of the House speech.
“The lawsuits will keep coming. Because eventually, the truth sues back,” he wrote on X.
No additional lawsuit had been filed against Mace as of Tuesday. And Mace has yet to file a response to Musgrave’s lawsuit.
Commenting on her own post about Bowman’s arrest, Mace said she hopes he “rots in hell.”
Mace has said she is considering a 2026 run for governor.
She has taken numerous jabs at Attorney General Alan Wilson, as well as Lt. Gov. Pam Evette, who have said they are considering a bid as well. U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman, as well as state Sens. Sean Bennett and Josh Kimbrell have said they are mulling a run as well.
After Mace’s speech, the State Law Enforcement Division confirmed that her ex-fiancé is being investigated for assault, harassment and voyeurism. The investigation began in December 2023 after SLED was contacted by U.S. Capitol Police, SLED said in a statement Feb. 10, which made no mention of the other three men.
He has vehemently denied the allegations and said he is cooperating with the investigation to clear his name.
On Tuesday, a SLED spokeswoman said the case remains active and ongoing.
Last week, federal prosecutors dropped charges against James McIntyre, an Illinois man who Mace accused of physically assaulting her with a violent handshake in the Capitol in December as he advocated for transgender youth.
The Washington Post and The Imprint, a Los Angeles-based nonprofit news outlet focused on child welfare and juvenile justice, spoke to witnesses at the time who said they saw a normal handshake between McIntyre and the congresswoman. The Imprint first reported the charges being dropped.
Mace said she won’t back down.
“When a man can physically assault a woman in the halls of Congress, with impunity, it sends an appalling message to every woman in America,” Mace said in a statement April 2. “If it can happen here, it can happen anywhere. I was injured, intentionally, and I am still in pain.”

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
Lawmakers will ask SD voters for permission to end Medicaid expansion if federal support declines

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, eager for Congress to reclaim constitutional authority over unilateral tariffs imposed by executive branch.","U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran, a Kansas Republican, said he supports bipartisan Senate legislation to restore Congress' constitutional authority to review unilateral tariffs imposed by the executive branch. (Kansas Reflector screen capture from U.S. Senate's YouTube channel)TOPEKA — Republican U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas pushed back against President Donald Trump’s vision of a trade war by joining a dozen cosponsors of federal legislation restricting unilateral tariffs without consent of Congress.
Under a Senate bill, a U.S. president would be required to inform Congress within 48 hours of issuing a new or modified tariff. A duty levied by the executive branch would expire unless the House and Senate passed a joint resolution within 60 days endorsing a tariff.
Moran said he joined a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, supporting restoration of Congress’ constitutional role in setting U.S. trade policy.
“The Constitution gives Congress the authority to make decisions regarding foreign commerce, including tariffs,” Moran said. “This legislation allows the president to use tariffs to respond to emergencies while permitting Congress to weigh the appropriateness of any tariffs that are imposed.”
Trump indicated he would veto the trade legislation if adopted by the House and Senate.
Global financial markets were thrown into disarray as investors responded the Trump’s tariffs on imports from dozens of countries. The S&P 500 finished Monday almost 18% below its February peak. Anxiety remained high due to concern Trump’s trade war could undermine economic growth and trigger inflation.
Moran said in a statement unfair trading practices by foreign countries had harmed U.S. producers, workers and consumers. Congress and the Trump administration should work to prevent American jobs from being lost to other countries due to distorted trade policies, he said.
He said tariffs had in the past caused the loss of agricultural markets to other countries. He expressed hope Trump’s latest round of trade sanctions would serve a purpose “quickly and, where appropriate, be lowered or eliminated.”
“American tariffs are often met with reciprocal tariffs, which are frequently aimed at our farmers and ranchers,” Moran said.
The tariff bill attracted 13 cosponsors that included Republican U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Todd Young of Indiana and Susan Collins of Maine.
Moran wasn’t joined in support of the Trade Review Act of 2025 by his Kansas peer, GOP Sen. Roger Marshall. On NewsNation, Marshall said Trump’s tariffs would bring manufacturing jobs to the United States, but the process would involve “short-term pain.”
Meanwhile, Moran said he met with representatives of the Kansas Farm Bureau and associations representing the state’s corn, sorghum and soybean farmers to discuss challenges and opportunities posed by tariffs. Kansas grows more crops than the state could consume and international markets have been a substantial source of income to farmers.
“We discussed opportunities for Kansas farmers through bilateral trade agreements with new international trading partners that Kansas commodities have not historically had as customers or where there is opportunity for increased demand,” the senator said.
Moran said trade conflict emerged as the agriculture economy endured high input costs, low commodity prices, record land values and extreme weather. He promised to advocate for legislation designed to “ensure the survival of family farms in Kansas.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Jerry-Moran-ukraine-senate.png,,,2025-04-08 10:07:10.051741

StebbinsThe Republican attorneys general for Iowa and South Carolina are leading a coalition of 11 states in seeking to overturn Michigan’s ban on conversion therapy for minors.
Contending that the law censors therapists’ speech, the coalition filed a brief Friday in the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals requesting a reversal of a decision issued in January by U.S. District Judge Jane Beckering. Beckering, who was appointed by former President Joe Biden, found the Michigan law does not govern free expression of religion or speech, but instead professional conduct, which she said the state has a “legitimate interest” in regulating.
Passed in 2023 by Michigan’s then Democratic-led Legislature, the law prohibits mental health professionals from seeking to alter a minor’s sexual orientation or gender identity, a practice known as conversion therapy, or risk facing disciplinary action that could result in the loss of their professional licenses.
However, the group of Republican attorneys general says the ruling sets up a “censorship regime” that forces mental health professionals to “choose between making a living in a licensed profession and retaining their right to speak freely.” SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The case stems from a lawsuit filed in July 2024 by Catholic Charities of Jackson, Lenawee and Hillsdale Counties on behalf of Emily McJones, a licensed therapist from Lansing, whose practice, Little Flower Counseling, provides “evidenced-based treatments from a perspective that is faithful to the teachings of the Catholic Church, while loving and caring for each client.”
However, the American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry has determined that not only do conversion therapies “lack scientific credibility and clinical utility,” there is “evidence that such interventions are harmful.” That stance is shared by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, as well as the American Psychological Association and the National Association of School Psychologists. 
Regardless, the Republican attorneys general argue  Michigan’s ban risks tainting medicine with politics. In addition to the attorneys general in Iowa and South Carolina, the brief is signed on by AGs in Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Montana, and North Dakota. 
“Free speech should protect the medical field from political pressure seeking to stifle scientific advancements. And it is far from clear that the ideological partisan bent embodied in Michigan’s law is ‘settled’ in any meaningful sense,” the brief said.
A similar law in Colorado is set to be reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court later this fall.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/DSC_0496_2-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 10:07:10.051741

(Photo courtesy of Alaska Department of Corrections)An Anchorage senator has proposed expanding the Alaska Board of Parole, and widening the range of experiences of its members, citing the board’s workload and importance of fairness and accountability in its work.
The parole board has granted far fewer people parole from state prisons in recent years. Since 2021, the board granted parole on average 25% of the time, with the other 75% denied or continued, according to a legislative audit last year.
According to the ACLU of Alaska, the board has released 79% fewer people and held 75% fewer hearings than before the COVID-19 pandemic. Advocates argue the high rate of denials is contributing to overcrowding and a sense of hopelessness, also contributing to higher rates of suicide. There have been at least 67 deaths in Alaska since 2020, with 17 reported as suicides. 
Senate Bill 62 expands the board of parole from five to seven members, “to help address a substantial workload” and “process parole applications in a fair and accountable manner,” according to a statement by the bill’s sponsor, Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage.

“This precipitous decline in successful parole applications has created this climate of hopelessness,” Tobin said in an interview. “It has created this dynamic where people don’t know why they should be involved in treatment, why they should be trying to rehabilitate. And that, to me, is very concerning.” 
Tobin said she frequently hears from concerned residents with family members who are incarcerated. “For every person who is behind bars, there are people outside who love them and who are concerned about their health and safety,” she said. Tobin said she wants to expand opportunities for parole, also because as a Christian she believes in redemption.
“Some folks have done terrible, terrible things, but that is not the whole of who they are,” she said. “There is an ability for them to be redeemed, and I believe that we should offer that path of redemption.”
The five-member parole board is appointed by Gov. Mike Dunleavy, and reviews applications for parole, which totaled 181 applicants last year. That review process includes whether they’ve taken part in educational and rehabilitation programs, as well as the person’s suitability for release, the nature of their offense, and behavior while incarcerated. The board also takes into consideration statements from any victims or their family members. 
Parole can be granted for those who are elderly, or with a severe medical diagnosis, with some exceptions for serious crimes. The parole board sets conditions of release like terms for work, housing, and sometimes further behavioral health treatment.  
The legislation would create selection criteria for the expanded seven-member board, and limit members to two five-year terms. Four of the seats would require certain licenses or expertise: 

one for a licensed physician, psychologist or psychiatrist;
one for a victim of a crime, a family member of a victim, or member of a victim advocacy group;
one for someone with expertise in addiction recovery; and
one for a member of a federally recognized tribe.

The bill would remove the only current specific experience requirement for board membership: that at least one has experience in criminal justice. It would keep a provision that the governor appoint people “on the basis of their qualifications to make decisions that are compatible with the welfare of the community and of individual offenders” and who are able to consider “the character and background of offenders and the circumstances under which offenses were committed.”
The tribal affiliation requirement is aimed at addressing the disproportionately high number of Alaska Native people incarcerated — the largest ethnic group in state prisons, at 44% in 2024, Tobin said in the sponsor statement that accompanied the bill. 
The legislation would also require the board of parole to submit an annual report on parole decisions, and reasons for granting or denying parole. 
Advocates, including with the ACLU, have complained that the current board’s decision process for discretionary parole is opaque. A legislative audit last year found “the board was unable to provide specific reasons why its parole approval rate decreased.”
“It’s hard to know if you’re going to be a successful applicant for discretionary parole, if you don’t know how the board of parole makes their determinations and decisions and why someone might be denied parole,” Tobin said. 
Chair says board follows law, considers each case individually
Tobin questioned Leitoni Tupou, the board chair, directly about some of these issues at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on March 26. Tupou has worked in Alaska corrections starting in 2000, and was appointed to the board in 2020. He’s up for another five-year term. 
When asked about the decline in numbers of parole applications granted, Tupou rejected the premise of the question.
“Every hearing is an individual hearing,” he said, and noted higher approval rates for drug offenses and property crimes.
When asked about demographic data of parolees being removed from the parole board website, Tupou said that data was not required to be public under current law.
For medical or geriatric parole, there were no applications granted in 2024, according to state data.  
When asked about these rates, Tupou said the board is confined to follow current law. “If the law allows the parole board the discretion to apply the law of mercy, I believe we can do that,” he said. “So my recommendation is we look at the current law when it comes to medical parole. Because there are times we’d like to release these folks, but our hands are tied. They do not meet the criteria set by the law to allow them to be released.”
He cited a recent case of a 94-year-old applicant for parole that the board denied. 
“Can you imagine the kind of expenses that we spend to take care of this person?” he said. “At the same time we had to look at the seriousness of his offense. He committed one of the most heinous crimes. At the same time, what is he going to do? He’s 94 years old. But the laws basically tell us he’s not qualified. So as lawmakers, I think that is something that needs to be reviewed.”
Tupou told the committee more addiction treatment and rehabilitation programs would benefit people who are incarcerated, as there can be waitlists or lack of programs offered at certain facilities. In some cases, he says the parole board “continues” the application, to allow people time to get off waitlists and into those treatment programs. 
“Because it appears to us, the only way we can help these folks is (for them) to participate in some programs,” Tupou said. “We cannot just let them be released to the community and have the parole officer in the community supervise them, without them being part of some kind of a program. Jobs are great, but programs (like) substance abuse treatment programs, sex offender treatment programs, mental health programs — those are the programs that have to be available for these folks to go to. And looking at the risk of them reoffending, the possibility will be less.”
After the hearing, Tobin said it sounds like “double jeopardy” for the parole board to put so much weight on the original crime, when someone has already been to trial and sentenced. 
She also noted it costs the state to keep people incarcerated — at a cost of $202 per day — plus medical care, at the expense of other programs and services. 
“The average cost is $75,000 (per person) per year,” she said. “I’m not saying that this is about cost containment and cost savings, but it’s all part of the conversation …. As we give money to our Department of Corrections to keep people incarcerated, we are making choices to not invest in other places, like pre-K (education).”
Tobin introduced similar legislation last year that failed to move out of committee. She said the bill this year scaled back some requirements for board seats, with feedback from other legislators. Those included requirements like a required seat for someone with a felony conviction that has been dismissed or sentence served, and limiting seats of former correctional employees. 
Advocates argue more transparency will help avoid recidivism
The Reentry Coalitions of Juneau, Anchorage and Fairbanks support the bill, as well as the ACLU of Alaska. 
Megan Edge, director of an ACLU project focused on prisons said the move to make the parole board process more transparent, and share decision making processes would also help better ensure support services and lower the rates of people reoffending, known as recidivism.  
“Why are they recidivating? Because most people that are making parole, they’re excited to go home,” she said. “Did they have a substance use issue? Did they have a mental health issue? Was it a housing problem? Was it an employment issue? And we just need better data to understand why our recidivism rate is where it is at and how we can improve it.”
Alaska rate of recidivism – defined as when someone is paroled and then violates the terms of parole or commits a crime again — was almost half, or 47% of discretionary parolees and 67% of mandatory parolees over the last three years.
Edge emphasized that more representation on the board of people with technical and career expertise — in behavioral health and rehabilitation in particular — can help improve conditions of release. “So I think a properly functioning parole board should be looking at an applicant’s ability to be successful once they’re released, and so when they’re not successful, we would all be served better on knowing why people are failing,” she said. “It’ll make our communities safer.”
Expanding opportunities for parole helps unite families, she added, and lessens negative impacts on children especially. She said cultivating hope can also improve prison safety and conditions for inmates, and for staff. 
“It’s sad. You hear the clink on the door, and you realize all these people are locked in there and like, it’s an impossible job,” Edge said, who also worked for the Department of Corrections under Gov. Walker’s administration. “So when you take that hope away from inmates, you’re making that a more toxic workplace for your staff. So there’s benefits for everybody when people have hope.”
SB 62 is being heard in the Senate State Affairs Committee with the next public hearing scheduled for Tuesday, April 8.

Legal groups that advocate for immigrant rights say the rise in detentions shows federal authorities are using Maine as a tool in its “mass deportation” goal, but caution that increased detentions don’t necessarily mean there is increased enforcement, as of now.
According to attorneys, while some of the people detained under U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement orders in Maine were arrested in the state, the majority appear to be transferred from other states. And they’re quickly transferred out, too. 
“It’s more of using Maine as a place to move people,” said Carol Garvan, legal director at the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine. 
Immigration arrests are happening in Maine, though it’s unclear if such arrests have increased. So far nationally, arrests and deportations have been lower in recent months compared to the same period last year, although legal experts are alarmed by the ways in which federal agents are making such arrests. 
Local police enforcement around the state has been disjointed so far in the absence of formal federal partnerships, adding to confusion and fear. 
First Maine police department joins ICE partnership

Last week, ICE signed its first official partnership with a local law enforcement agency, which will allow officers to arrest people on immigration violations in the course of routine work, an authority previously reserved for federal agents. An application from another police department is pending.   
Detentions by the numbers  
Maine’s largest jail is seeing the highest number of detentions. Cumberland County Jail in Portland had 68 people detained under ICE orders as of March 28, with a total of 178 since Jan. 20, according to the sheriff’s office. 
The jail lifted a restriction on intake, largely due to staffing shortages, this summer. ICE detentions have increased since.  
In comparison, in 2024, the jail had 10 people detained under ICE orders in June, 20 in July, 27 in August, 47 in September, 49 in October, 54 in November and 50 in December. 
Anna Welch, the founding director of Maine Law’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic and professor at University of Maine Law School, started a project in January to provide limited consultations for ICE detainees at Cumberland County Jail, in partnership with the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine and the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project. 
More than half of the over 100 people detained under ICE orders who she and her students have spoken with were transferred to the jail from other states, including Massachusetts, Connecticut, Rhode Island and New Jersey. 
Unlike many other states, Maine doesn’t have a dedicated ICE facility, which means local jails are relied on for detentions.

The Cumberland County Sheriff’s Office doesn’t have a direct contract with ICE but has had a contract with the U.S. Marshal Service since July 2010. Under this contract, the county jail is given a daily rate to house federal detainees, including people awaiting a hearing on their immigration status or deportation.
In the absence of a formal agreement, other county jails in Maine temporarily detain immigrants at the request of ICE. 
For example, at the end of March, Androscoggin County Jail had three people with immigration charges, however they are being held on state charges that must be adjudicated first before the federal detainer kicks in, said Major Lane Feldman, the jail administrator.
“We probably had 10 total since Jan. 20, but we do not hold long term, nor do we have an agreement with [Customs and Border Protection],” Feldman said of people detained under ICE orders. “They pick up and move within 24-48 hours of arrest.”
York County Jail is handling such cases similarly. Sheriff William King Jr. said, as of the end of March, they had four people being held on criminal charges who also had ICE detainers.
Androscoggin County Jail and York County Jail don’t have official contracts with federal authorities like Cumberland, Feldman and King confirmed. 
Two Bridges Regional Jail in Wiscasset is also holding people in immigration custody, anywhere from a dozen to 25 ICE detainees, according to legal advocacy groups that said they first began receiving communications from people detained under such orders there roughly a month ago, after not being aware of any cases prior.  
Two Bridges Regional Jail did not respond to multiple requests for comment regarding whether the facility has an agreement with federal authorities or is housing immigration detainees. ICE also did not respond to questions about whether the agency has a contract with Two Bridges and how many people are detained there under ICE orders.
During an interview with Maine Morning Star, Welch paused to note she’d just received another intake sheet from someone calling her organization from Two Bridges. “So they definitely are detaining immigrants there,” she said. “I just don’t know the specifics about how many bed spaces they’ve made available.” 
Expanding operations in the region
Just as many of the people being detained under ICE orders in the state weren’t arrested in Maine, they aren’t staying here long. 
Movement during immigration detention is common. As local sheriffs and jail administrators clarified, holds are often 24-72 hours before people are picked up by federal authorities. 
“We were just speaking with someone who was at Cumberland County Jail about issues and then when we went to talk with them again, they were in Texas,” said Garvan from the ACLU of Maine. 










It's certainly a money maker, and that obviously raises large red flags in terms of the human costs.


– Anna Welch, the founding director of Maine Law’s Refugee and Human Rights Clinic and professor at University of Maine Law Schoo


ICE may move people for any number of reasons — space, staffing — but Garvan and Welch said regardless of intent, this movement creates chaos and makes it more difficult for both legal counsel to advocate for their clients and for families to keep in touch. 
“I think that the open secret is that this is used as a way to move people farther away from where their communities are, where their lawyers are, where there are resources for them to maybe be able to better defend their immigration case,” Welch said. 
Just over the state border in New Hampshire, ICE started using the medium-security Federal Correctional Institution in Berlin to detain immigrants, according to the ACLU of New Hampshire.
In February, the LA Times obtained an email from FCI Sheridan — a medium-security facility in Oregon — to its staff asking for volunteers willing to work at the New Hampshire facility that the email said is expected to receive at least 500 migrants from ICE.
While the UMaine Law group hasn’t heard of anyone being transferred from Cumberland to FCI Berlin yet, Welch said she thinks it’s only a matter of time.
“I think this is a reflection of the larger goal of this administration to expand space for immigration detention,” Welch said.  
Prisons and jails have financial incentives to assist with that expansion, Welch said. Like many across the U.S., jails in Maine have concerns about being underresourced and are seeking additional funding in the state budget.
A key reason the Cumberland County Jail had a moratorium on housing people incarcerated on federal charges was because the federal government found its staffing to be insufficient. When the moratorium was lifted this summer, Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce told the Portland Press Herald that the U.S. Marshal Service contract is a crucial part of the jail’s funding model. 
“It’s certainly a money maker,” Welch said, “and that obviously raises large red flags in terms of the human costs.”

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham on Monday signed five dozen bills on topics running the gamut from emergency services and elections to public safety and psychedelic mushroom therapy. 
She signed Senate Bill 41, mandating New Mexico establish an alert system for missing Indigenous people, a move praised by the Coalition to Stop Violence Against Native Women.
“Today, we celebrate a victory for Native communities across New Mexico and beyond,” CSVANW Executive Director  Tiffany Jiron said in a statement.  “The signing of SB41 is not just a policy achievement, it’s a victory for every Native mother, daughter, sister, and aunt who has ever been impacted by the violence that continues to ravage our communities…The Turquoise Alert System is a powerful tool that will help law enforcement act quickly when a Native person goes missing, providing the necessary resources to respond with urgency and care.”
Senate Bill 16, which allows independent voters to participate in primary elections without changing voter registration (Lujan Grisham signaled at the end of the session she liked this proposal). 
Other important legislation the governor signed includes: House Bill 458, which establishes the Energy, Minerals, and Natural Resources Department’s authority to regulate carbon sequestration — pumping carbon dioxide into the ground. The bill collects fees for injection and establishes a fund to cover the costs of liability for ensuring carbon stays stored underground. HB458 passed on a 26-11 vote after contentious debate in the Senate’s final late-night session. 
The governor also signed off on Senate Bill 57, which creates an exemption in the state’s public records laws for any records that contain “personal identifying information or sensitive information,” of public sector abortion providers. 
Senate Bill 219, which establishes a program for medicinal use of psilocybin mushrooms.
Senate Bill 364, which allows immigrants authorized to work by the federal government to become police officers in New Mexico.
While the governor vetoed a more comprehensive set of reforms to the state’s parole system, she did sign Senate Bill 375, which allows early discharge for people who comply with probation and removes payment of court and parole costs as a condition of parole eligibility.

The governor has until April 11 to act on legislation, such as signing into law or vetoing legislation. If a bill goes unsigned after the deadline, it is not enacted — called a pocket veto.
Effective immediately
Four bills contain “emergency clauses,” meaning they went into effect as soon as the governor signed them.

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)Over the rumble and rattle of an about 30-minute FrontRunner ride, Utah leaders eagerly pitched U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy on how supporting transit is key to managing the state’s explosive growth.
Cashing in on an invitation from Republican Utah Sen. John Curtis, who Duffy said approached him about plans for FrontRunner as soon as he was nominated for the post, the secretary boarded the southbound train at Salt Lake Central Station on Monday afternoon for a jaunt to the next station, where the entire contingent crossed the platform to a second train waiting to take them back.
Riding first on the ground level and then upstairs on the double-decker cars, Duffy’s fellow passengers pointed out the windows to Utah’s mountains, new housing developments along the line, and Intermountain Health’s massive Murray hospital, complete with its own TRAX stop.

Speaking quickly in the few minutes they had, they shared stories of adult children living in parents’ basements in the wake of a housing affordability and supply crisis, while praising the transit system’s access to key locations on the Wasatch Front, like the University of Utah, and free fares for students, some of whom can now choose not to own cars.
“Isn’t that a different conversation? What kids don’t want licenses and cars these days?” Duffy quipped back.
Flanked by Curtis and Rep. Celeste Maloy, R-Utah, who noted she was representing all of Utah’s U.S. House representatives, Duffy took a moment after returning to the station to praise Utah’s transit as “doing it the right way.” 
“From my perspective at the Department of Transportation, I want to invest in great transit projects, the ones that are on budget, that are clean, that are safe, that move people, that actually have projections on ridership and actually meet those projections or exceed those projections, not give me projections, and then come in with lower ridership, and they cost more money,” Duffy said. “You may be an example for other communities to look at as a case study on how they could do it and do it better.”

The sunny review of transit in Utah — the state with the third-highest rate of car ownership, at 96% of households — was starkly different from Duffy’s comments last week during a brief ride on the New York City subway with Mayor Eric Adams, where the secretary bemoaned crime, blasted the city’s congestion pricing plan as forcing New Yorkers onto trains because it’s too expensive to drive, and repeated threats to withhold federal funding.
Curtis told reporters that during Duffy’s Utah visit he had explained to the secretary about the state’s distinctive population distribution, with “80 or 85% of our population in this narrow little corridor, and then we have a vast rural part of the state.”
“We’re trying to provide transportation for all of them, and it’s key to be able to have an effective FrontRunner, TRAX, bus system, in addition to our hard surface road area, all that comes together to be able to accommodate the massive growth,” Curtis said.
When asked how President Donald Trump’s tariff strategy, which has tanked global markets while stoking fears of rising prices and economic recession, could impact federal investments in transit, Duffy was quick to stand by the president with an optimistic endorsement of tariffs as “a massive revenue driver into the federal coffers” that can then be invested across the country, including in projects like roads and bridges.
In a follow-up about tariffs’ impacts on Americans’ personal finances, Curtis was more reserved, saying “we’ve all seen this before, right?”
“This is a long-term investment we’re making as a country. I’m very, very sympathetic, particularly with small businesses that are dealing with tariffs, and we’ll see where this goes,” Curtis said. “But we’re clearly on this path that we’re committed to, and I think we in the Senate need to do all we can to get a good runway for our small businesses and bring predictability into this as well.”
UTA expects these transit projects to be ready before the 2034 SLC-UT Olympics

Utah Department of Transportation executive director Carlos Braceras said following the event he believed Duffy had heard Utah’s message that as the state grows, it will need to build up infrastructure — which means roads and bridges, as well as transit.
“They like Utah, because they see Utah as a place that’s innovative. We’re very cost effective, and we move fast,” Braceras said of the state’s federal partners.
As federal funds are slashed in Washington, D.C., Braceras said he isn’t nervous about any Utah transportation projects. Long-term formula funding for transportation doesn’t appear to be in jeopardy, he said, while any discretionary grant funding that does — or doesn’t — come through for the state “is kind of that sugar on top.”
Looking at not just the state’s current transit needs and projected growth, but at Salt Lake City and Utah hosting the 2034 Winter Olympics, Duffy emphasized the need for a positive partnership between Utah’s state and federal leaders and the Trump administration.
“This is not just Utah. This is America that presents itself at the Winter Olympics, and making sure we make the right investments and we have the right partnership amongst your federal delegation, your state representatives, but also the administration is key to make sure we get it right,” Duffy said.

The Senate Judiciary Committee delayed action last week on SB 167, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would require such support to be paid until the child turns 19.
“The premise is to make sure we take care of the minor children that are left behind if the breadwinner is killed,” Orr said.

He told the committee that the idea from the bill originated from Texas. Orr said he thought to himself, “Well, if it will prevent DUIs (driving under the influence), to know how serious we are about it.”
The penalty would be in addition to other restitution that an individual who is convicted of the crime would owe.
A death resulting from a person operating a motor vehicle or vessel while intoxicated is considered criminally negligent homicide under Alabama law, a Class C felony punishable by up to 10 years in prison.
Language in the bill states that the court may consider the financial needs and resources of the surviving children as well as the parent or guardian, or the state of Alabama if no one else is available to care for the children.
Other factors the court could consider include the standard of living of the family, the physical and emotional needs of the children as well as educational considerations.
“The reasonable work-related child care expenses of the surviving parent or guardian,” the bill states.
Orr also proposed an amendment to the legislation stating that the penalty is separate from any civil penalties that a court may impose in the case because of wrongful death, which could add to the financial burden of those who are convicted.
Sen. Greg Albritton, R-Atmore, had concerns that the penalty could effectively require the person convicted of the parent’s death to have a relationship with the family whose loved one was killed.
“I don’t know if we want to go that route,” he said to the committee. “I can see creative lawyers using that in that way.”
Albritton also said he was concerned about the broader impact the legislation has on the community.
“What about the guy who does this, and he has a family of his own?” Albritton said. “We are not only punishing the individual, but we are also taking, and affecting more people, for the act of an individual. I think we need to be cautious of this.”
Sen. Vivian Davis Figures, D-Mobile, asked the committee to consider the situation when a parent loses a child because a person is driving under the influence of drugs and alcohol.
“If we are going to do something like this, I think we need to consider all cases when things happen by someone,” she said.
After hearing all the arguments, Orr withdrew his proposed amendment and requested that a vote be delayed.

Assembly Bill 475, heard Friday in the Assembly Ways and Means Committee, would appropriate $18 million to Clark County and $7 million to Reno to continue their ongoing eviction diversion programs. Tenants who qualify for the program are able to get outstanding rents paid and avoid an eviction. 
Democratic Assemblymember Daniele Monroe-Moreno, the bill’s sponsor, anticipated more people could be at risk of financial insecurity and eviction since “the times we are living in are going to get more interesting.”
“There is a need for eviction support in our state, and I believe it’s only going to get greater,” Monroe-Moreno said. 
Monroe-Moreno’s concerns are shared throughout the nation and the world, as the trade war started by Donald Trump last week has led to historic nosedives in markets and increasing fears of a recession.
Both Clark and Washoe counties have benefited from rental assistance dollars to divert people from evictions, said Jonathan Norman, statewide advocacy, outreach and policy director for Nevada Coalition of Legal Service Providers. 
Since pandemic-era rental assistance has scaled back, eviction diversion has been exclusive to people living with disabilities or who are elderly with fixed incomes. 
The $25 million request is higher than $18 million approved in 2023.
“The reason the ask is higher is because we want to expand beyond seniors and adults with disabilities to families with young kids,” Norman said. “In Clark County, they identified about 1,600 families with a child under the age of one at risk for eviction. This would allow us to route those cases to eviction diversion as well.”
Reno Judge Kendra Bertschy told lawmakers the proposed financial allocation is a “crucial investment in community stability, public safety and responsible governance.” 
“The need for legislative support for rental assistance remains urgent,” she said. “Economic challenges, medical emergencies, and other unforeseen events continue to put renters at risk of eviction. Without continued funding, many will face housing insecurity, increasing the burden on emergency services, shelters and the judicial system ultimately costing taxpayers more.”  
Prior to the pandemic, the Las Vegas Justice Court averaged about 33,000 eviction cases filed each year, said Las Vegas Judge Jessica Goodey.
There have been “record high filings” and Las Vegas Justice Court had “43,030 evictions filed” in 2024,” she said. She didn’t note how many evictions were granted in 2024.
“To date in 2025, we have had 9,985 evictions and we are anticipating that number to continue to increase with the current state of affairs,” Goodey said. 
From the onset of the Covid pandemic in 2020, state and local governments have used federal relief dollars to help people at risk of eviction.
Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo vetoed a bill in 2023 that would extend a modified version of an eviction protection passed by state lawmakers in 2021 that temporarily paused an eviction while rental assistance applications were pending.
However, Lombardo approved Assembly Bill 396 in 2023 that allocated $18 million in rental assistance dollars.
State lawmakers originally sought to approve $44 million for rental assistance in Clark and Washoe county with AB 396 in 2023. The amount was reduced to $12 million for Clark County and $3 million each for Reno and Sparks and Reno. 
The Las Vegas Justice Court used the funds to expand its existing eviction diversion program while Reno stood up a new eviction diversion program, Norman said.
Of the cases going through the Vegas court, “1,375 diverted cases in 2024 were households with an adult with a disability and 575 were seniors,” he said. 
While he said Reno has offered rental assistance since the pandemic, it only recently started a housing justice court that offers an eviction diversion program.
Since Reno’s eviction diversion court started in August, “94 households went through the eviction diversion program with 80% of them remained housed,” Norman said.
Without additional funds provided by the state, the program most likely won’t be able to continue, Bertschy said.
Republican Assemblymember P.K. O’Neill questioned if lawmakers were forgetting to allocate rental assistance support for rurals. 
When lawmakers were debating the 2023 allocations, rurals indicated they were still using ARPA dollars for rental support, Norman said. He said they indicated they wouldn’t need additional funds through the legislature.
Monroe-Moreno said she is looking into an amendment to include funding for rural areas.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)A group representing midwives in the state has withdrawn its support for a bill intended to update their practice regulations after a Senate committee made significant changes to it. 
As originally filed, SB 87, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, would have allowed midwives to administer three parts of newborn screenings: heel stick, hearing screening, and Critical Congenital Heart Disease (CCHD) screening, which can provide early detection of genetic or metabolic conditions. 
These screenings should be completed within 24-48 hours of birth, according to the Alabama Department of Public Health. Midwives currently have to recommend their patients to a pediatrician’s office, often delaying the time-sensitive screenings. Alabama allows a birth attendant to administer them if a physician is absent but has not allowed midwives to acquire them.
Nancy Megginson, legislative chair with the Alabama Midwives Alliance (ALMA), said in a phone interview Monday that midwives have faced ambiguity regarding their ability to conduct newborn screenings. While existing law requires midwives to instruct clients about these screenings, it only explicitly allows them to order the tests. This has led to midwives being denied the screening kits, particularly the blood spot test cards collected via heel sticks.
“Our issue has been once we were licensed, we started ordering the newborn screening cards from the Department of Public Health, because our law says a midwife shall order the newborn screening. We were actually told to stop trying to order them, that they weren’t going to give them to us because they didn’t know who would be administering it,” Megginson said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The substitute version introduced and adopted in the committee would authorize licensed midwives to administer a heel stick but explicitly states that a midwife “is prohibited from interpreting any tests or screens under this subsection and shall cause any results to be referred to a physician of the mother choosing who is licensed to practice medicine in this state.”
Midwives say the new language in the bill is too restrictive, particularly concerning newborn care and screening.  
Sen. Larry Stutts, R-Tuscumbia, who introduced the substitute, said in an interview Monday that saying midwives “are not qualified” to interpret results. 
“They’re not pediatricians. They’re not qualified to interpret the results and provide newborn care,” Stutts said.
Under the substitute bill, Stutts said midwives “can collect the sample and then send it to somebody that is qualified” but that the bill “does not expand anything else that they can do.”
Megginson said that the new language stating midwives are prohibited from providing any newborn care was “hostile language that had never been discussed.”
Midwives are trained in newborn care for up to six months, Megginson said, but they are not trying to interpret test results or diagnose conditions. Restricting their ability to perform state-mandated screenings or assist with basic newborn needs is “absolutely absurd,” Megginson said.
She is now actively lobbying legislators to amend the bill on the Senate floor.
“We are encouraging anyone to place an amendment, to put it back on track, where all three screenings would be included, where no language about newborn care to be written. We’d like that to be completely struck through,” Megginson said.

Kay Ivey has signed into law a bill granting paid parental leave to state employees and public school K-12 teachers. This is a huge win for state employees, who will no longer need to scramble to cover the cost of unpaid leave in order to recover from birth and care for their newborn babies.
The lawmakers who championed the bill have spoken about benefits including increasing competitiveness with other states and the private sector, and reducing financial strain on covered parents and families while caring for a newborn. However, the benefits of paid parental leave stretch far beyond these.
Paid parental leave leads to lower infant and child mortality, fewer re-hospitalizations for infants and mothers, improved maternal mental health, higher breastfeeding rates and more extended duration, a decrease in intimate partner violence, and improved outcomes for children throughout their lifespan from improved infant attachment and child development, all the way to increased education and future wage growth as adults.

In a state that ranks third highest in maternal mortality and has a rising infant death rate that consistently exceeds the national average, any intervention that could improve the health of mothers and babies in our state should be a top priority.
The Legislature has signaled its interest in addressing Alabama’s abysmal infant and maternal mortality rates with other bills this session, including one approving presumptive Medicaid coverage for pregnant people to encourage early prenatal care and one focused on postpartum depression education and screening.
Paid maternity and paternity leave for state employees is an excellent next step in the fight to keep Alabama mothers and infants healthy, but the Legislature need not stop there.
Fourteen other states already have mandatory statewide paid family and medical leave laws, which typically provide six to 12 weeks of paid leave for new parents. If fears about negative effects on businesses are stopping our lawmakers from following suit, they can rest easy. Some of these policies have been in place for over a decade and have been found to be business-friendly, resulting in lower turnover and improved employee retention, higher productivity, and higher worker morale.
The majority of Fortune 500 companies,; over three-quarters of the top 20 hospitals in the nation,; tech giants like Google, and the military have already recognized what is slowly beginning to dawn on Alabama’s lawmakers: Ppaid parental leave is good for business, good for families, and good for society.
I applaud Gov. Ivey and the legislature for granting paid parental leave to Alabama’s teachers and state employees. But the next step — paid parental leave for all Alabama families — still awaits action.

(Air Canada press photo)Lost in the focus on President Donald Trump’s tariffs is the economic impact his war of words is having on international visitation to Las Vegas. When the President of the United States tells people they are not welcome, could be detained, or even end up in an El Salvadoran prison, they listen and decide to go elsewhere. The result will hit Las Vegas hard with empty hotel rooms, vacant tables at restaurants and empty seats at shows. The President may cause a recession in Las Vegas from his hanging up the “not welcome” sign to the rest of the world. 
International tourism is big business in Las Vegas, with over 5 million people estimated to have come last year. No country sends more people to Las Vegas than Canada. Canadians make up 30 percent of Las Vegas’s international travel. With domestic air travel to Harry Reid airport down almost 8% over the first two months of the year, Las Vegas can ill afford a sharp decline in international visitors. 
Trump’s repeated insults to Canada have Canadians saying no thanks to coming to America. Air travel bookings from Canada to America for this summer are already down by 70 percent from last year. If that holds for Las Vegas, it would mean 1 million fewer international tourists to Las Vegas from Canada alone. Canada, Mexico, and England combine for almost two-thirds of all international tourists to Las Vegas, and while those used to be three of our closest economic and political allies, Trump seems to be doing everything he can to change that. Canada and England have issued new formal travel advisories to their citizens about the dangers of travelling to America
Las Vegas is the 6th most visited city in America, and like Orlando, the city whose economy is most dependent on travel and tourism. Other cities who host more foreign visitors have other main industries. Los Angeles has entertainment, New York has finance. But in Las Vegas travel and tourism are the core industries. Research I conducted at UNLV’s Brookings Mountain West with Ember Smith detailed how cities like Las Vegas that rely on travel and tourism fared even worse during Covid than those with core industries less directly impacted by pandemic related travel shutdowns. More than 40 percent of Nevada’s entire state GDP comes from tourism. Start hammering away at that and it does not take much to trigger a recession. 
Trump’s trash talking of our allies is self-defeating in his attempt to reduce America’s trade deficit. Every dollar a foreign tourist spends in Las Vegas counts as an American export for purposes of counting our gross domestic product (GDP), and reduces our trade deficit. Economists think of it as America exporting the fun of Las Vegas to people living abroad. Promoting international visitation to the U.S. was part of President Obama’s successful campaign to double America’s exports and reduce our trade deficit. During my service on President Obama’s National Travel and Tourism Strategy we worked to make it easier for people to travel to America, creating jobs and growing our nation’s economy.
Trump campaigned with populist promises to win the votes of Nevadans like no taxes on tips and capping credit card interest rates at 10 percent. But he has governed as President quite differently, instigating a trade war, threatening Canada and Greenland with invasions, and praising Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. 
America’s odds of a recession have shot up since Trump took office. Trump’s trade war, punitive actions against his perceived enemies, and attacks on the rule of law, along with Elon Musk’s slash and burn of government agencies have generated widespread business uncertainty, and shrunk consumer confidence. 
The stock market’s crash on Trump’s tariffs last week could, in theory, be reversed should Trump walk back his tariffs.

In an audio recording obtained by the Current, Mesquite City Manager Edward Owen Dickie tells several residents that he notified police union officials last year that if Chief MaQuade Chesley were fired, he’d replace him with a “6 foot 5 Black woman…”
“…Early on, I said ‘guys, I’m going down to Louisiana, I’m going back to the back parishes and I’m going to find me a 6 foot 5 Black woman chief…’” Dickie is heard saying in the recording from February. 
The statement echoes another by Dickie recorded in late 2024, according to sources, in which he repeats a similar assertion made to the Mesquite Police Officers Association, which was seeking Chesley’s ouster.  
“I told them I’d like to go down to Louisiana with the biggest Black Aunt Jemima. I was careful how I said it cuz…. But I said ‘(unintelligible) would love that and come back and just flippin’ whip you guys into shape,’” Dickie can be heard saying. “I brought this up. I’ve heard things and if the Chief doesn’t come back you guys, it’s not going to be, you’re probably going to hate the next Chief more than him.” 
Dickie goes on to say he’s “heard there’s racial issues” in the department.

Dickie, during a phone interview, called the statements “poor taste of humor. I didn’t know I was being recorded. I own it. I learned you just don’t say things that you really shouldn’t be saying. The City Council is aware and they’re going to hand down a reprimand.”
Dickie says the residents who recorded him were alleging racism against police officers and suggested he hire a Black chief. 
“‘Maybe what we need is diversity,’ I was telling them. ‘Maybe it’s an African-American woman, you know, that is qualified,’” Dickie said of the recorded conversations.
“Those comments are inappropriate for anybody to be using, especially in a work environment, especially in a position of power, where you’re picking the next police chief,” says Wes Boger, who was re-elected in November to serve on the city council, but resigned after a month, citing  a desire to spend more time with family.
“I don’t blame Wes for leaving, because this is not worth it,” Councilwoman Patti Gallo, the only member of four who voted against terminating Chesley, said at a special meeting in March that was called to investigate Chesley and ratify his termination.
Last month, Judge Nadia Krall ruled the city failed to comply with the law in its investigation of Chesley, and granted the former chief’s request for a restraining order and injunction, prohibiting the city from holding a public investigation into Chesley’s termination.
Dickie’s statements should preclude him from “any role in the recruitment and/or appointment of the next Chief of Police,” Mesquite resident Bob Muszar wrote in an emailed complaint last week to Mesquite Mayor Jesse Whipple. 
Federal law prohibits hiring based on race. Dickie says the city has scrapped its search and will stick with a successor from inside the department.
Whipple, in a reply to Muszar, defended Dickie, suggesting he “was trying to express to them that he would like to make sure that racism was not acceptable within our city or department,” and “was using that example as an illustration that our department could use some diversity within its leadership. I do not believe that he intended it literally.”
“At some point, the City Manager’s intended message becomes irrelevant,” Muszar wrote back. “Throwing race, gender, size and point of origin all into a single statement generates just too much fodder for anyone wanting to challenge the recruitment/appointment process.”
While Dickie’s recorded statements indicate he was defending Chesley, the relationship at some point became more antagonistic.
When Dickie’s statements prompted a flood of public record requests from residents seeking his text messages and emails, Chesley says he asked the city manager how he was coping with the requests. 
Dickie, in response, defended his earlier comments.
“I didn’t say anything like ‘I hate n——, I hate Mexicans,’” Dickie can be heard saying on the recording provided by Chesley.  
Dickie, asked to authenticate the recording, said he didn’t remember saying the ‘N’ word, adding he never uses it. “If I said it, it would be that I was saying ‘I didn’t say this.’” 
Chesley suggests Dickie could have conveyed the thought without using the actual word. 
Dickie alleges Chesley may have altered the recording. “I know he learned how to do that at the FBI academy.”

“I have the entire conversation and it is easy to prove it wasn’t doctored,” Chesley responded, adding he would sign a court affidavit stating as much. 
Dickie also suggests he was baited by residents Nick Alfonsetti and Mike Benham to repeat the assertion he made to the police union about finding a female Black chief. 
“It’s sad,” he said, adding he “didn’t know there are people really like that out there.” 
Alfonsetti and Benham say Dickie was not baited. The discussion, they say, was in response to Dickie’s earlier assurances that he would not fire Chesley.
“That’s when the whole thing came up about hiring somebody outside Mesquite, because the police didn’t like anybody that was in the department,” Alfonsetti said.  
Dickie said he is good friends with Chesley, though he acknowledges they never socialized together. Chesley says Dickie, who was hired by the city last summer, “is not my friend and never has been. I don’t associate with people who make racist comments or jokes. In the short time I’ve known Owen he has repeatedly done both.” 
Dickie, who initially cited a no-confidence vote by the Mesquite Police Officers’ Association as one of the factors to be considered in Chesley’s termination, was unable to say how many members voted or how many expressed no confidence in Chesley. 
The MPOA did not respond to the Current’s request for the information. 
“As a labor attorney who represents labor organizations, I would never recommend doing a vote of no confidence unless you can have almost 100% if not 100% of your members voting,” says Reno attorney Ronald Dreher, who is representing Chesley in a lawsuit against the city, adding “it’s odd not to put up the numbers.”  
The wrongful termination  lawsuit filed by Chesley against the city alleges the city violated Nevada law, which requires any investigation of a police officer be conducted by law enforcement. The city has commissioned several investigations, Dreher said, but none were conducted by law enforcement. 
Fall from grace
Mesquite, a small city about 80 miles northeast of Las Vegas, was founded by Mormon pioneers in the 1880s. The population was predominantly Mormon until a building boom in the last 15 years brought thousands of retirees to the Virgin Valley community. 
“Every police chief that’s ever been promoted in the City of Mesquite has been a white Mormon,” says Chesley. “I fit the bill in 2019 when I became the police chief.” 
A turning point came, Chesley says, when he began getting calls from individuals who expected favors, such as making traffic tickets disappear. “My response was always ‘we have court proceedings for that.’”   
His fall from grace with the Mormon community, he says, was cemented on the heels of rumors allegedly circulated by former City Attorney Bob Sweetin. Sweetin was appointed last year by Gov. Joe Lombardo to the Real Estate Division’s Common Interest Communities Commission, which regulates homeowners’ associations.
“Bob had spread rumors that I was having affairs and getting people pregnant and having sexual relationships with minor females, and so I filed a harassment complaint with Human Resources,” says Chesley. “I’ve been a police executive for the past 14 years. I’ve always held myself to a higher standard. I don’t have locker room talk. I don’t have sexual discussions like most guys do. No one will ever say ‘MaQuade is talking filth.’ I just don’t talk that way. I don’t like to be around it. To be accused of these things floored me. It destroyed me and my family.” 
Sweetin says an investigation cleared him of spreading rumors. He says his termination was purely political.
Sweetin also alleged financial crimes against Chesley. Attorney General Aaron Ford investigated and found no evidence of criminal violations, according to Chesley’s lawsuit against the city.
The final straw for Chesley may have been an internal investigation Mesquite Police initiated under Chesley’s watch into allegations leveled against Officer Ryan Hughes. 
“Ryan had applied multiple times for the police department, but he never passed any background checks,” says Chesley. As a police officer, Chesley assisted on Hughes’ background investigations and quickly learned Hughes had a reputation as a bully.  
Hughes was eventually hired by former Chief Troy Tanner. 
In June of 2024, Mesquite Police launched an internal investigation of Hughes. Chesley says the officer went on leave for twelve weeks, mounted a campaign against Chesley, and won assurances from two council members, Karen Fielding and Brian Wursten, that they’d vote to fire Chesley if the police union could deliver a vote of no confidence. 
Hughes, Fielding, and Wursten did not respond to requests for comment.
In January, Hughes was terminated because he never passed a background check, a psychological exam, or a polygraph examination, according to Chesley, but was rehired three days later by Dickie. 
“Ryan Hughes was terminated, through no fault of his own, due to the City’s discovery of an incomplete background investigation performed by a previous police administration,” Dickie told the Current via text. He says Hughes was rehired “due to the fact the discrepancy was not due to any action or inaction on his part.” 
“They wouldn’t allow me to be involved at all,” says Chesley, adding Hughes “painted a picture that I retaliated against him and placed him on administrative leave and investigated him” because he was vocal in his opposition to Chesley in union meetings.
At the January 14th city council meeting following Hughes’ rehiring, text messages from Hughes’ police department cell phone obtained through a public records request were read during public comment by a detractor, Daniel Miller. 
“Watching this battle between the Dallas little dicks and buff daddies feels like I’m watching two severely Down Syndrome kids see who can lick more windows on the short bus on their way to school,” read one text attributed to Hughes.
“I could not stop envisioning beating the shit out of both of those kids last night. I had to open the Corona app and do some breathing exercises,” says another text. 
In another text, Hughes decries a city law that prohibits drinking alcohol in the park. “The government can’t tell us when and where we can drink. I’ll bring an ice chest.”
In another text, Hughes writes he hasn’t “been very good about logging” his K9 training. “I may or may not be copying and pasting my logs from a different time period and just changing the dates.”
The revelation could prove perilous for the city should Hughes’ arrests involving a K9 be challenged in court, say experts.
Whipple, the mayor, said the text messages and K9 log falsification were investigated internally by Mesquite Police, who deemed Hughes could not lose his job for the offenses under the union contract.
“There were two officers who had an issue with the K9 logs,” Whipple said during a phone interview Monday. “Both were disciplined by loss of pay for that, and Hughes had more” sanctions as a result of the offensive texts.
Just weeks after Hughes’ termination and rapid rehiring, Chesley was summoned to a meeting with Dickie, the city manager, and the mayor. 
Chesley, who says he was at a doctor’s appointment at the time, informed the city that he was unable to go to work, based on his doctor’s order. 
Dickie says Chesley’s failure to attend the meeting amounted to insubordination and terminated him.
“It was just weird,” Dickie said of Chesley’s failure to make the meeting. He declined to say whether it’s city policy to terminate individuals who take leave on doctor’s orders.

(Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images).There is an urgent threat to some of the most valuable properties that the citizens of Missouri share: our history, culture and arts.
On March 31, billionaire Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, targeted the National Endowment for the Humanities with the aim of substantially reducing its staff by up to 80%, cutting the agency’s crucial grant programs and rescinding grants that have already been awarded.
This means that projects already in progress, with budgets previously decided and in some cases hires in place, are halting.
Over the last 10 years, Missouri received $19.4 million in grants from the NEH, an independent federal agency supporting the humanities in every state and U.S. jurisdiction. It is tasked by Congress to provide humanities access to all Americans, and Congress has appropriated funds for that purpose.
The recent actions by DOGE imperil the NEH’s ability to perform its essential functions as mandated by Congress and negatively affect all Missourians.
Some of the cuts impact Missouri’s institutions of higher learning, including a matching grant to renovate a part of Ellis Library at the University of Missouri-Columbia to create a safe and appropriate environment for the library’s vulnerable special collections. This grant has been cancelled as of April 3.
Other cuts affect institutions outside higher education that are central to the telling of Missouri’s history, provide access to information and knowledge for all and offer important programs for Missourians that honor their experiences and teach others about them.
At the national level, the NEH funds Dialogues on the Experience of War programs that offer veterans the opportunity to connect over their shared experiences and have helped bridge the divide between Veterans and civilians.
In Missouri, this program is funded through the Missouri Humanities Council, which sponsors numerous programs for veterans, including annual Veterans Writing Workshops providing veterans and their families with an outlet for self-expression through writing workshops that partner veterans with experienced professional authors. Humanities councils and other cultural institutions have now been defunded in all 50 states.
The NEH funded many of the public events and research projects celebrating Missouri’s bicentennial in 2020. NEH funding is essential for celebrating the nation’s upcoming 250th anniversary next year and Missouri’s place in our shared history.
Through NEH initiatives like A More Perfect Union: Exploring America’s Story and Celebrating Its 250 Years of Cultural Heritage, launched in 2019, teams have been collaborating to engage the public in America’s history. The NEH has already awarded more than $85 million to support these efforts in all 50 U.S. states and six jurisdictions that will be impacted by ongoing cuts to the agency.
The NEH reaches communities throughout the United States through humanities institutions such as libraries, museums and historic sites that offer lifelong learning opportunities to people of all ages in their communities, whether through museum exhibitions, lectures, tours, podcasts, documentary films or conversation programs.
NEH funds preservation activities, such as upgrades to storage facilities that are crucial for the preservation of cultural heritage yet rarely funded by others. Across Missouri, NEH funds workshops and programming for educators, students, scholars and genealogists.
Grants from the NEH have been awarded to institutions across the state including the National Blues Museum, The National World War I Museum, The Holocaust Museum & Learning Center of St. Louis, The Missouri Historical Society and the Missouri Botanical Garden.
NEH funding makes publicly available important archival collections, including the papers of our founders and other significant Americans — ranging from John and Abigail Adams to Eleanor Roosevelt, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. — and has been instrumental in the study of one of Missouri’s most famous writers, Mark Twain. It made the Hellen Keller Archive’s 160,000 materials available digitally to the public and accessible to blind, deaf, and deafblind audiences.
NEH-funded digital projects include The American Soldier in World War II and Civil War and Reconstruction Governors of Mississippi, which provide deep insights into the lives of everyday people experiencing extraordinary events. The NEH helps fund prize-winning books, documentary films, and radio shows that connect the public with national and regional histories and culture, such as the documentary The Vietnam War (2017) and radio shows and podcasts such as American Routes and Lost Highways, making insights into language, music and history to anyone with an internet connection or a radio.
Missourians deserve a thriving arts and humanities ecosystem that supports learning for all, including students, senior citizens and veterans. History belongs to everybody, and we want to ensure that Missouri’s history continues to be taught to the public and that other cultural opportunities remain accessible to all Missourians.
What better way to create community than by sharing our history and safeguarding our public libraries.

That’s [&#8230;]","Crews work on the Interstate 5 bridge over the Columbia River in 2019. (Oregon Department of Transportation)Washington state lawmakers on Monday backed a huge increase in the amount of toll revenues they’ll count on to help pay for construction of a replacement bridge on Interstate 5 across the Columbia River. 
The House Transportation Committee amended then approved House Bill 1958, authorizing the sale of $2.5 billion in general obligation bonds. That’s $900 million more than assumed in the original bill. The legislation now goes to the Rules Committee and a likely floor vote in the coming days.
With significant cost increases on major highway and bridge projects in recent years, it made sense to recalibrate to a higher bonding capacity to avoid getting into a pinch, backers said. 
“The idea is that we have to have enough resources for construction. We think we have enough, but we want to make sure,” said Rep. Jake Fey, D-Tacoma, chair of the House Transportation Committee and the bill’s sponsor. 
Sen. Marko Liias, D-Edmonds, chair of the Senate Transportation Committee, said, “We need to make sure this project is well-positioned to stay on schedule and get built as soon as possible.”
Project planners have estimated the price tag for replacing the bridge will range from $5 billion to $7.5 billion, with a likely figure of around $6 billion. Permits are anticipated by 2026. Once rolling, construction is expected to last until 2032.
Washington and Oregon have committed about $1 billion each and the states have snagged federal grants totaling $2.1 billion. 
Tolls were counted on to raise at least $1.2 billion of the current projected cost. They’ll be imposed in both directions on the existing bridge as early as spring of 2026.
Because Washington will be administering the tolling program, it is the one that needs to issue the bonds.
Bonds, a long-assumed source of financing for the new span linking Washington and Oregon, would pay for design and construction, as well as future maintenance and operation.
The borrowed money would be repaid with toll proceeds, gas taxes, and vehicle fees. Because the bonds would be backed by “the full faith and credit of the state,” the general fund could be tapped as a last-resort source of repayment.
Rep. John Ley, R-Vancouver, a vocal opponent of tolling, opposed the bill in committee on Monday. He said he’ll propose changes when it reaches the House floor for a vote.
Ley said he’ll offer an amendment to ensure Washington and Oregon share equally in the liability if there are not enough proceeds to repay the bonds. As written, responsibility would fall solely upon Washington, he argued.
More importantly, he said, with a new project cost estimate due out in summer, it’s too soon for this conversation.
“We shouldn’t be talking about bonding tolls until we have a price tag,” he said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/interstate5-bridge-1024x607.jpg,,,2025-04-08 08:04:52.709443

(Vailmont photo from her X account; Weil photo from the Weil congressional campaign)As reports of big fundraising numbers emerged leading into last week’s special congressional elections in Florida, Democratic political consultants from around the state took aim at the young man helping to bring in that bounty — 23-year-old St. Petersburg political strategist Jackson McMillan. 
The criticism was based on the fact that the seats in Florida Congressional District 1 and District 6 were considered unattainable for Democrats — Donald Trump and the then-incumbent Republicans who ran in those districts in November won by more than 30 percentage points.
  Political consultant Jackson McMillan (Photo from Key Lime Strategies website)
“Were these races ever winnable? My answer is absolutely,” McMillan told this reporter on WMNF-88.5 FM on Friday morning. 
“Our polling internally on the Josh Weil campaign matched the White House’s lead pollster that came out just a week before Election Day, so when my polling number that my firm ran matched Tony Fabrizio’s, I was like, I must be doing something right.”
An internal poll conducted by Trump pollster Fabrizio did show Democrat Josh Weil with a lead over Republican Randy Fine in CD 6. Another survey from St. Pete Polls in the week leading up to the election showed Fine up by just four points, 48%-44%.
Fine ended up defeating Weil by 14 points on Election Day. Republican Jimmy Patronis defeated Democrat Gay Valimont in CD 1 by 15 points.
The two Democrats raised more that $20 million in their campaigns, 90% of it from outside of Florida, McMillan says. Some fellow Democratic strategists contend that while McMillan and his firm Key Lime Strategies help raise a lot of awareness about the races, in the end his candidates still lost by double digits.
They question whether it was appropriate to tell Democratic donors that their contributions could help narrow the GOP’s numeric advantage in Congress.
“We had no business telling donors we were going to win those seats. That was a straight-up lie,” said Orlando based Democratic strategist Chris Mitchell with Statecraft Digital said last Friday on WMNF. 
“We’ve now heard the last three days the Florida Democratic Party and others take victory laps on losing by double-digits, and that is not how we build long, systemic infrastructure in the state, and that’s not how we produce long-term outcomes,” Mitchell said.
Campaign finance records from the Weil and Valimont campaigns in mid-March showed that they had paid Key Lime Strategies $4.7 million, more than one third their total spending.
McMillan says that “it costs money to make money,” with much of those funds going to pay for fund-raising ads.
He also noted that the campaigns received nothing from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and not that much from the Democratic National Committee. He appreciates what the Florida Democratic Party was able to contribute, but says “it was a drop in the bucket of the money that we pulled in from around the country, and it costs money to solicit that money. It costs money to text. It costs money to send emails.”
McMillan boasts about his transparency, saying that his fee structure is transparent on his firm’s website. But that transparency only goes so far, as he will not disclose how much profit his firm will ultimately make from working on the Weil and Valimont campaigns.
“It was certainly not millions of dollars,” he said in a phone conversation on Saturday. “I don’t want to give you a figure because it might be incorrect.”
‘I’m done dealing with these a—’
As Florida Democrats’ electoral hopes have deteriorated in recent election cycles, the consulting class has been subject to escalating attacks.
“People like Jackson McMillan are the exact type of consultants who people say are the problem in our party,” said Democratic National Committee Vice Chair David Hogg in a social media posting last month.
“I’m done dealing with these a— and it’s time they start being called out. Everyone says f— the consultants but won’t name names. Jackson is one of many.” [Elisions by the Phoenix.]
Hogg was responding to New York Democratic U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s comment that footage taken from a 92-minute Instagram Live presentation she gave on Feb. 3 for an ad boosting Valimont and Weil was being used without her consent. McMillan then took down the ad immediately.
Another incident that has rankled some is the contention that he worked for a candidate for St. Petersburg City Council last year who he knew didn’t live within the city limits. He denies that he knew that.
The candidate, Juan Lopez Estevez, was endorsed by former St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman and former Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn in the open District 3 race. Estevez finished fourth in the Aug. 20 primary election.
“To my knowledge, Juan was living at his mother’s house,” McMillan said over the weekend. “He told me he lived in St. Petersburg. At no point did I ever have any reason to believe that Juan didn’t live on Cherry street. It was only after accusations started flying after the campaign was over that I had any real inclination. I’ve heard the rumors, but I don’t have anything to substantiate that.”
However, the Rev. Andy Oliver, the pastor of the Allendale United Methodist Church in St. Petersburg, said that he spoke with McMillan on Friday as both left the radio station where they had just appeared as guests. Oliver was supporting another candidate in the race, Nick Carey, who he thought might have made the runoff if it hadn’t been for Estevez’s participation.
“I said listen, ‘I am still very angry with you … because you knowingly ran a candidate that did not live in the district,'” Oliver said.
“In that conversation, he admitted to me that he knew that Juan didn’t live in the district. He said, ‘He was there for two months,’ and that to me was even more telling.” The St. Petersburg charter states that a candidate for city council must be a resident of the declared district for at least 12 months as of the date of the primary election.
“At one point, he laughed and said, ‘Of course, he didn’t live there.’ And so Jackson admitted that he knew that Juan did not live in the district. His reasons for doing that are that he had a company to support and Gen Z people on his team that needed to be paid.”
“I’m not sure what the pastor is referring to,” McMillan said when told of Oliver’s recollection of their discussion. “I remember a piece of the conversation discussing the voter registration of Juan’s father who shares a name with him was originally used as ‘proof’ that Juan didn’t live in the district, because Juan’s father is registered in Tampa. I found that deeply comedic, because any amount of investigation would have revealed that it was Juan’s father. Perhaps a remark was misunderstood.”
For his part, Estevez insists the rumor that he didn’t reside in St. Petersburg “is 100% false.”
“If anyone had challenged my eligibility based on my residency, not only would they have been unsuccessful, but they would have been subjected to legal action as well,” he said in a text message.
Praise from the candidates
While he’s taking some licks, both Weil and Valimont are effusive in praising McMillan’s work in the special elections.
“Jackson McMillan took a teacher with no public profile and raised $15M in small dollars — unheard of for a Florida candidate, even for an elected official,” Weil told the Phoenix in email.
“The payments to Key Lime Strategies you see on our FEC report include all the costs of building and managing what would ultimately become one of the largest donor networks in the country, which includes all of the paid comms overhead for messaging via email, text, and social media over 4 months, all of our mailers, and all of our polling.
“We executed a plan built to deliver 90k votes that would be successful up to 40% voter turnout. Nobody outside of our team believed at any point along the way the turnout would even come close to that number, and ultimately it exceeded it. The work he did on this campaign should cement Jackson McMillan as the gold standard for Dem fundraising and political coordination in the state of Florida for years to come. There is nobody else in this state who could have produced anything close to what he did here in District 6 these last four months.”
Valimont also praised McMillan in a statement.
“Our campaign was powered by an average donation of just $32, proving that grassroots support can drive monumental change. For the first time in decades, we established a foundation for Democrats in the Panhandle, building infrastructure that will strengthen traditionally red areas for years to come.

“I want to recognize Jackson McMillan and the staff of Key Lime Strategies for their incredible work, which has laid the groundwork for continued progress in this area. The money invested in this race helped re-enroll thousands of Democrats in vote-by-mail and boosted voter registration efforts that would never have garnered any investment under normal circumstances. This campaign was always about more than just one race — it was about building a movement for lasting change.
“This race demonstrates that strategic investment in deep red districts, centered on fieldwork and direct voter engagement, can create meaningful shifts for Democrats as we head into the pivotal 2026 midterms. Our campaign is dedicated to sustaining this progress by allocating $170K to strengthen Democratic infrastructure in FL-01, ensuring the strides we’ve made continue to flourish. These organizations, including each county’s Democratic Executive Committee and Black Caucus, have championed Panhandle Democrats long before our campaign, stood with us for 20 months, and we’re excited to see the momentum they will build in the future.”
 ‘Jackson was a lifeline’


Among the winning candidates McMillan has worked are Tampa City Council members Lynn Hurtak and Bill Carlson. Hurtak declined to comment, while Carlson did not return a request for comment.

Kelly Johnson, who worked with McMillan on two unsuccessful campaigns for state House in Pinellas County over the past five years, praised his work.
“When I ran in 2020 against the incoming speaker of the House [Chris Sprawls], I was a new person in the political arena and Jackson was a lifeline for the entire campaign,” she said in a text message. “He was able to secure meetings and interviews and lead every single of our campaign meetings. At the time I did have a lot of television coverage and media coverage, which was amazing.”
While political analysts around the country continue to assess whether the margins of the two congressional races will ultimately mean anything in 2026, Mitchell fears that the tactics employed to raise so much campaign cash in districts that were so Republican leaning could hurt the Democrats in the future.
“Imagine if this was in CD-13 in Pinellas County in a special election where we could win that race, right?” he said, referring to the congressional district where Republican Anna Paulina Luna won by 10 points last fall. “They’re not likely to give as much or give next time, so I think that is the bigger thing we need to focus on.”

It had promised $5 billion to build a much-needed public, fast charging network. This freeze of federal EV charging infrastructure funds dismayed the auto industry and EV advocates alike. 
Automakers, charging companies and even gas stations have called for restoring the grant program, which would have provided Minnesota with $68 million for public charging stations.  
But amidst the disappointing news is a lesser known reality: this setback barely impacts the practicality of driving electric in Minnesota right now.  
The rising popularity of EVs in Minnesota is hard to deny. Walk or drive around, and you’re likely to spot several different electric models, whether it’s a Rivian pick-up, a Hyundai Ioniq SUV, or the ever-ubiquitous Tesla sedans. EV sales reached roughly 7.6% of all new passenger vehicles in Minnesota in 2024, and there are more than 65,000 EVs on Minnesota’s roads. Many Minnesotans are interested in making the switch to electric.  
Public charging stations, which make operating an EV more accessible and convenient, have been proliferating too. Since 2022, the number of fast-charging ports has more than doubled, while Level 2 charging increased over 60%. 
How is this possible? It’s not just federal dollars at work building out our public charging network. Much of this charging infrastructure growth comes from a mix of sources, including private investments, utilities and government. These funding sources will continue to invest in public charging in Minnesota. So while the loss of federal funding is a blow, it’s far from a death knell for EV charging. 
That’s also because juicing up an EV is much different than gassing up an internal combustion engine. 
Instead of driving to the gas station to fill up, most owners plug their EV in at home and let their vehicle charge overnight — just like a cell phone— and start each day with a full “tank.”
Plugging in at home like this is a much better experience than driving to a gas station. This simple reality also transforms the “range anxiety” concern that prospective buyers often have, since much of our charging will be done at home. Couple that with the fact that 97% of driving trips are under 50 miles — while new EVs average over 280 miles of range — and it’s no wonder that more Minnesotans are buying EVs. 
For two-car households, the solution is even simpler: Keep a gas vehicle for occasional long trips while enjoying the quieter, cheaper and lower-maintenance EV for daily driving. 
With over 100 new EV models available, in addition to more affordable used options and leasing terms, Minnesotans have now more choices.
We estimate there are over 60,000 home chargers in garages across the state, and there are about 2,300 public charging station ports available.  
While home charging is a cornerstone of easy EV ownership, we do recognize it’s not available for everyone. Renters or those in apartment or condo buildings face real barriers to installing EV charging where they live, making it harder and more expensive to use an EV. But state policymakers, electric utilities, charging infrastructure companies and EV advocates are actively working to solve this challenge through targeted programs. And our growing public charging network will help too. 
The bottom line: Don’t let federal funding headlines discourage you from switching to an EV. 
Minnesota’s charging infrastructure will continue to grow through private investment, utility programs, and state support. The EV transition is charging ahead.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/car-charging-1536x1024-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 08:04:52.709443

Senate Bill 5337, sponsored by Sen. Tina Orwall, D-Des Moines, would require the Department of Social and Health Services to create, manage and enforce a certification process for licensed assisted living facilities. 
“This bill is around supporting people as they age and supporting families and giving the Department of Social and Health Services the tools they need for that work,” Orwall said. 
In 2021, an informal study by the state’s Dementia Action Collaborative found there were about 237 assisted living facilities in Washington that advertised memory care or specialized dementia care, but their services varied. 
“Currently there are about 126,000 seniors in Washington with Alzheimer’s disease, which is about 10% of the population 65 and up and that number is growing every day,” said Brad Forbes from the Alzheimer’s Association. 
The lack of standardized care can make it difficult for individuals or families to understand the services and staffing that facilities offer. 
“The challenge exists when the individual gives their trust and significant payments, sometimes $10,000 a month, for what they think is comprehensive care designed for a person experiencing cognitive decline,” said Joanna Grist, a lobbyist for AARP. 
The bill would require these facilities to maintain staff onsite 24 hours a day, to have at least six hours of continuing education for workers per year related to dementia-related behaviors such as aggression, and provide to patients with individual and group activities. 
A memory care facility is defined as one that is devoted specifically to that type of care or that offers a special unit or wing for those with dementia. They help people with housekeeping, meals, snacks, laundry and activities. 
Under the bill, the department would have to maintain a publicly available list of certified assisted living facilities that specialize in memory care or have memory care units. They would also review facilities’ compliance with state law and conduct regular inspections. Facilities that are out of compliance could face civil penalties. 
The Senate passed the bill 49-0 last month, and it’s now moving along in the House. If approved, the bill would require assisted living facilities to be certified by July 1, 2026. 
“As we age, we want everyone to get the care they need and deserve,” Orwall said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/long-term-care-e1685491929946-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 08:04:52.709443

(Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Criticisms continued to mount Monday even after a sweeping committee amendment rolled back significant portions of a bill that seeks to limit diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in schools and state government.
Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee additionally spoke out after the Republican-dominated panel approved major additions to a separate proposal — weaving in contentious criminal penalties for “street camping” that seemingly died in an earlier bill — without taking public comments beforehand.
Among the original DEI-focused provisions removed from Senate Bill 289 were provisions concerning university diversity committees, as well as an extensive, four-pronged definition of DEI “effort(s)” that included a ban on “differential treatment” or “special benefits” on the basis of “race, sex, color or ethnicity.”
 Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers (Photo courtesy of Indiana House Republicans)
Instead, key language was largely rewritten to more specifically outlaw “discrimination” in state education, public employment and licensing settings that is “based on a personal characteristic of the person.”
Added, too, were revised civil penalties that could be imposed by the Indiana attorney general for violations: $50,000 for a first offense; and $100,000 for a second or subsequent offense.
Committee chairman Rep. Chris Jeter, R-Fishers, said his goal was to “focus the bill a little bit” and “make it a little bit more workable for some of the folks that they’re going to have to abide by it.”
“I think it can be difficult to legislate words and acronyms, and so we really tried to hone in on the actions that we are trying to address,” said Jeter, who offered the amendment.
He said the bill, overall, “is an effort to sort of codify” and “be consistent” with executive orders issued by President Donald Trump and Gov. Mike Braun.
The governor’s order replaced DEI throughout state government policies and programming with “merit, excellence and innovation” (MEI). It also closed the Office of the Chief Equity, Inclusion and Opportunity Officer created by former Gov. Eric Holcomb.
The committee advanced the bill to the House floor in a 7-3 vote, along party lines. The measure must get the OK from the full chamber by April 15, the third-reading deadline.
It previously passed out of the Senate 34-13, with four Republicans unfavorable.
Before Monday’s vote, more than two hours of committee testimony was dominated by medical students and professors from Indiana University (IU) and other Hoosier colleges. Many said they appreciated elements of Monday’s amendment but remained opposed to the underlying bill and its implications.
“Opponents of DEI will have you believe that we are integrating a radical curriculum and training for health care professions that promotes racist and sexist ideas about some burden that falls chiefly on white male students to correct historical injustice. And I understand that’s a concerning possibility, but I’m here today to express that’s simply not true. We actually have a lot to agree on,” said IU medical student Amina Dalal.
“DEI actually protects a merit based system. I don’t believe that we need South Asian physicians like myself because of some diversity quota,” she continued. “I believe that we need diverse physicians because anyone that is qualified and passionate about medicine should have a fair opportunity to become a physician.”
Medical students push back
The latest draft expands certain carveouts, explicitly exempting “employment action(s) concerning participation in a public contract by a minority business enterprise, women’s business enterprise, or veteran business enterprise, if the employment action is authorized by law.”
Colleges and universities can also make decisions around grants, scholarships or fee remissions on the basis of “personal characteristic(s)” as long as those awards do not include any “state funds or resources.”
 Sen. Gary Byrne listens in committee on Thursday, March 27, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
But state offices and universities would not be allowed to require employees to complete training — or licensing — “asserting that, or endorsing the theory that,” a person with a certain personal characteristic:

is inherently superior or inferior to a person with a different personal characteristic; 
should be blamed for actions committed in the past; 
or has a moral character that is determined by a personal characteristic of the person. 

Jeter said fines for violations “are significantly larger than we normally see in bills that we do — and that was by design.”
“We are not, in this bill, telling any school or anybody else that they have to close any offices or reorder the way that they’re doing things as far as what type of personnel they have doing what,” Jeter said. “We wanted to make sure that if some of these offices continued … there is a significant financial disincentive for them to try to do this in another way, or through another office, or through another program.”
While bill author Republican Sen. Gary Byrne, R-Byrneville, conceded that issues stemming from DEI “have not been rampant at the state level,” Byrne said his constituents “want to make sure that everyone is treated equally — they don’t want Indiana government to engage in discrimination, whatever the intentions may be.”
He pointed to prior Senate committee testimony from IU medical students about “problems they’ve seen in the university.”










I believe that we need diverse physicians because anyone that is qualified and passionate about medicine should have a fair opportunity to become a physician.


– Indiana University medical student Amina Dalal


Dr. Cindy Basinski, an adjunct OB-GYN clinical professor, contended that many medical students oppose DEI policies and instruction but are afraid to voice their opinions publicly.
“They’re forced to use pronouns. … There are also students who are not allowed to speak against minor-informed care. They’re also not allowed to speak against other politically divisive issues, like maybe there are some students who think there are only female and male as genders,” Basinski told the committee. “These are important topics that are important to discuss scientifically among students. And if students do not feel empowered by administrators or other students to speak up, then we are not going to have the most robust educational system that we can have in Indiana.”
Nearly a dozen medical students said they disagreed, however, and argued that Basinski’s testimony, in particular, was inaccurate. 
“Everybody at my school is allowed to express their opinions about different aspects of medical care. IUSM encourages students to actively discuss medicine with their peers. There are clubs of students who support the pro-life movement, various religious movements, and even Republican ideals,” said Laney Cordell, a fourth-year IU medical student. “Many, if not most, of the positions claimed about my school are completely unfounded.”
Homelessness amendment adopted — but no public comments
Also headed to the House floor is Senate Bill 197, originally a measure to address building safety laws.
But multiple GOP amendments reshaped the bill entirely, including revived language from House Bill 1662, which sought to tackle homelessness before dying mid-session in the House.
Tweaked provisions from that legislation were added to the Senate bill, stipulating that “a person may not camp, sleep, or use for long term shelter a public right-of-way or public land unless authorized for that use by the state or political subdivision, as appropriate.”
Those who have not moved from a public right-of-way within 24 hours of a law enforcement officer’s warning — or from public land within 72 hours — could be arrested and charged with a Class C misdemeanor. The charge carries a maximum penalty of 60 days in jail or a $500 fine.
Homeless advocates oppose Indiana bill to criminalize sidewalk camping

Before an arrest can be made, though, new bill language would require officers to first determine “if there are reasonable grounds for an emergency detention of the person.” Transportation would must offered to a shelter, mental health service or other housing facility within five miles, as long as one exists and has space available. “Crisis intervention teams” could be called to assist officers, too.
If an arrest is made, legal proceedings would be referred to a problem solving court “to make sure that these individuals are getting the necessary services to get them housing and treatment — and trying to be as humane as possible to make sure that they are getting the care that they deserve,” Jeter said.
Even so. Rep. Victoria Garcia Wilburn, D-Fishers, questioned the “germaneness of this bill and the time in which it dropped.”
“I just haven’t had enough time to digest it and even to put my hands around it,” she said before voting against the amendment.
Rep. Maureen Bauer, D-South Bend, took issue with the lack of public engagement on that change and others.
“I think some people would have liked to have testified on this,” Bauer said. “The amendment was added on a short notice, without stakeholders being able to provide input. I’m kind of disappointed that we won’t have the opportunity for public testimony on this.”
The House-version of the bill mirrored model legislation from the Cicero Institute, a Texas-based think tank which has lobbied in roughly a dozen states for homelessness policies that shift money away from housing initiatives and instead direct dollars toward substance abuse and mental health treatment.
Nearly all who testified spoke out against the earlier proposal, with advocates arguing that it “wrongly criminalizes homelessness.”

DonahueThe Montana Board of Regents announced Monday that Brock Tessman, former deputy commissioner in Montana and current president of Northern Michigan University, will serve as the next president of Montana State University in Bozeman.
Tessman has verbally accepted an offer and will take the reins on July 1, 2025, pending final negotiations and Board of Regents approval at its May meeting, according to a news release from the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education.
Clayton Christian, Commissioner of Higher Education and chairperson of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, said the committee saw “intense interest” in the position.
“I’m confident the process has yielded an outstanding, visionary leader in Dr. Tessman,” Christian said in a statement. “We believe Dr. Tessman is exceptionally well positioned to guide MSU to new heights.”

  Brock Tessman is named the next president of Montana State University in Bozeman and will take the reins in July 2025 following the retirement of President Waded Cruzado. (Provided by MSU)
MSU is the largest university in Montana, with enrollment that topped 17,000 in fall 2024, a record. It also saw a record $257 million in research expenditures in 2024.
Tessman, who visited the campus last month along with one other finalist, will serve as MSU’s 13th president if confirmed.
He’ll lead the flagship in a time of significant challenge for higher education, with cultural pressure from the Trump administration. MSU faces its own difficulties, with previous opened investigations by the federal Office for Civil Rights for numerous discrimination allegations.
Details of the offer to Tessman were not immediately available Monday morning.
Current MSU President Waded Cruzado is a top paid public official in Montana, with an estimated $576,300 in salary and other compensation as of last August.
The search for a new president started in August 2024 when Cruzado announced her plans to retire after 15 years. A news release from the Commissioner’s Office said “her administration has left an indelible mark on the university and the MSU community.”
However, Regent Dean Folkvord and member of the Search Advisory Committee said he knew the charge was not to replace Cruzado but to identify a successor who would lead with passion and dedication.
“I think we succeeded, and I look forward to working with Dr. Tessman as he takes the reins,” Folkvord said in a statement.
The news release said Tessman’s accomplishments at Northern Michigan include steady enrollment growth at both undergraduate and graduate levels, record retention rates (78%), financial stability with top-tier bond ratings, unprecedented levels of private giving, and the completion of major capital projects.
“Dr. Tessman’s stewardship has fostered positive momentum across all aspects of university operations,” the news release said.
Tessman previously served as deputy commissioner for academic affairs in the Montana University System and dean of the Davidson Honors College at the University of Montana. He earned his bachelor’s degree in international relations from Brown University and both his master’s and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
The news release said Tessman is known for his energy, dedication to students, strong communication skills, and ability to deliver results — “qualities that make him uniquely suited to lead MSU into its next chapter.”
“Montana State University holds a special place in my heart given my previous work within the Montana University System,” Tessman said in a statement. “I am honored by this opportunity to serve as MSU’s next president and look forward to building on its incredible legacy.”

George Hruza speaks, a Republican from Huntleigh, speaks during House debate (Tim Bommel/House Communications).The Missouri House gave initial approval Monday to a bill that seeks to prevent antisemitism in public schools and colleges, with some raising concerns it could punish those who speak out against Israel.
The bill would require the state’s Department of Elementary and Secondary Education and Department of Higher Education to assign a staff member to monitor “antisemetic discrimination and harassment” and investigate whether schools have responsibility for incidents. It also encourages schools to teach pieces of Jewish-American heritage.
State Rep. George Hruza, a Republican from Huntleigh, said the bill was inspired by his mother, a Holocaust survivor who had frequent nightmares about her time in a concentration camp.
“It was not until we arrived in the United States that the nightmares went away and she started speaking about her experience and embraced her Jewish heritage,” Hruza said. “She felt safe in the United States. On Oct. 7, 2023, that all changed.”
That day, Hamas attacked Israel and started the ongoing war between Israel and Palestinian militant groups. The conflict spurred the highest number of antisemetic incidents in a year recorded by the Anti-Defamation League.
Hruza hopes the legislation can cut back on these incidents, citing a recent case in Affton where a man spray-painted Nazi and white supremecist graffiti on school buildings.
Dissent for the bill stems from the use of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s working definition of antisemitism. The definition has been adopted by a majority of U.S. states and included in orders at the federal level — though the lead drafter of the definition has spoken against its application “as a tool to target or chill speech on a college campus.”
Alongside the IHRA definition are examples of antisemitism, which the bill adopts. The list includes “claiming that the existence of a State of Israel is a racist endeavor” and applying double standards to Israel as discriminatory. Both Hruza’s bill and the IHRA say criticism of Israel is okay when it is “similar to criticism toward any other country.”
When a House committee debated the bill earlier this year, some argued the legislation was an “attempt to silence criticism of Israel on college campuses.”
State Rep. Stephanie Hein, a Springfield Democrat, voted “present” in committee on the bill and struggled to weigh the good pieces against controversial elements.
“There is a lot of emotion behind this subject…  and there are a lot of good things in this bill,” she said Monday. “The area of contention is the definition that is used.”
State Rep. Wick Thomas, a Kansas City Democrat, asked Hruza if the bill “might also be about ending critiques of Israel and the Palestinian conflict.”
“The bill is intended to keep the Jewish students safe on campus. It really is not taking sides or some kind of position on the conflict in the Middle East,” Hruza said.
Although the bulk of the bill’s pushback came from Democrats, positions were not clearly split by party lines.
State Rep. Ian Mackey, a Democrat from St. Louis, said he didn’t think the legislation would impede free-speech rights.
“The First Amendment has always confined speech to a reasonable time, place and manner,” he said. “You do not have the right to do that on a college campus in front of students who are simply trying to get to class.”
Republican Rep. Darin Chappell, of Rogersville, told Hruza he had concerns.
He has argued in the past against recognizing minority groups in state law, Chappell said, “to be lionized and set above on a pedestal.”
He can’t set those convictions aside, Chappell said, simply because  “it is one of my colleagues on this side of the aisle that is presenting (this bill).”
The House approved the bill with an amendment from Democratic state Rep. Raychel Proudie of Ferguson that bans schools from discriminating against textured hair and protective styles, like locks and braids. The legislation is often dubbed the CROWN Act and has been proposed by Missouri lawmakers since 2020.
The House must vote on the legislation again before sending it to the Senate.

(Photo courtesy of WEDC)The sweeping tariffs President Donald Trump put in place last week have left key Wisconsin business leaders as well as the state’s important trading partners confused and uncertain, the state’s top economic development official said Monday.
Missy Hughes, CEO of the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., spoke to the Wisconsin Examiner from Germany, where she and Gov. Tony Evers are in the midst of a trade mission. Hughes left March 29 and returns to Wisconsin this week.
“The government officials, economic development officials, the businesses that we’ve been talking to are very confused about how we got here after over 75 years worth of partnering and working together,” Hughes said. “The folks here are really wondering what has happened and where this is going.”
Hughes said she’s hearing regularly from Wisconsin businesses that have integrated themselves into the global economy.
“I’ve been in touch with companies that are directly importing things like coffee [for which] there’s really no way to work around the tariffs,” she said. “And so they’re very concerned about just increased costs on their bottom line.”
Other businesses have connected with the supply chains that run between Canada and Mexico through the United States. They are “sending products back and forth across those borders, and are now very confused and concerned about how to make their supply chains work,” Hughes said.
For businesses that have had a good run for the last several years, “[there] is real frustration around instability and unpredictability,” she said. “They were experiencing growth, they were doing well, and now they’re concerned that that might be endangered.”
A ‘man-made crisis’
Hughes contrasted the crisis brought on by the tariffs and the responses to them with the COVID-19 pandemic’s disruption to the economy five years ago.
“This is a man-made crisis,” whereas the pandemic was “a crisis that was not man-made,” she said.
“For the average Wisconsinite the concern I have is the increased cost in their pocketbook,” Hughes said. “There’s going to be increased grocery prices, there might be inflation. It’s going to cost more to replace your dishwasher or your automobile.”
Those present “an impact [that] is difficult to predict,” she said. “This is really going to be an unfolding crisis as we see immediate impacts and then impacts that will evolve, due to changes that are being made on a daily basis.”
In addition to the volatility from the tariffs, Hughes said, there’s also uncertainty from unexpected and sweeping cuts across federal agencies, resulting in disruptions that range from university research programs cut short to social services delayed or ended.
Markets worldwide take another dive as Trump threatens higher tariffs on China

Farmers are losing grants they have been relying on, she said, but also are faced with losing the counsel they’ve relied on at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to help them manage regulations.
Leaders of a biohealth company have expressed “their concern that the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] is no longer going to be the premier global agency that people rely on,” Hughes said.
“There’s things that are going to be immediately apparent and things that are going to be apparent as we see real expertise and institutional knowledge from our agencies disappear,” she added.
Maintaining relationships 
The trade mission took the Wisconsin delegation to France as well as Germany. It is aimed at encouraging businesses in Europe to buy Wisconsin exports and talking up the Badger State for companies interested in establishing or expanding their operations here.
A highlight of the visit was kicking off the 50th anniversary of Wisconsin’s sister-state relationship with the German state of Hesse (Hessen). The group also attended the Hannover Messe, a major worldwide advanced manufacturing trade show.
In the face of the startling reversal from longstanding relationships between the U.S. and the world, Hughes said, leaders the state delegation met with welcomed Wisconsin’s continued overtures.
“Obviously, things are still very volatile,” Hughes said. Despite that, she added, “people have been so happy that we are here extending a handshake and reminding everyone that there are opportunities for relationships beyond what’s happening in Washington, D.C.”
Joining the trip were four Wisconsin companies and representatives of New North, a Wisconsin regional economic development and business organization. The Wisconsin participants were looking at opportunities such as distribution deals in Europe for their products, Hughes said.
“They were by and large very happy with their visits and the opportunities to create relationships,” Hughes said.
The other principal aim of the trip was to connect with companies in Europe that have Wisconsin operations or are interested in establishing a presence in the state.
“While those conversations were positive, there was certainly also concern expressed about, what if there’s a slowdown, what if there’s a recession,” Hughes said. A recurring theme in those conversations, she added, was the “need to understand what the economy is doing, and we need things to not be as volatile as they are right now.”
The Wisconsin team is working “to remind folks that Wisconsin’s is a strong economy,” she said. “We have strong businesses that are interested in being and already participating in the global market and want that to continue. So I think, you know, we are a steady hand during this volatile time and I think that’s really beneficial.”
Business confidence at stake
In the face of the current economic turmoil, Hughes said she worries about the toll on business confidence.
“When you lose confidence you start to become risk averse, you hold off on making investments,” she said. That’s important in Wisconsin because of the state’s role making large, expensive machinery.
“We make CAT scans and MRIs and tractors and big industrial machinery,” Hughes said. “People need confidence before they make those purchases. And so if we lose confidence, it’s going to be harder to recover even if the tariffs were taken away next week, or next month.”
Confidence is hard to measure and not always easily predicted, she acknowledged. “My fear is that people will really start to become risk-averse, and that hinders the whole growth of the economy.”
Despite that fear, however, she said she’s found reasons to buoy her spirits in the conversations she’s had over the last two weeks.
“The desire for a relationship, the desire for connections, the long-term historic partnerships that we’ve had are still here,” Hughes said. She professed optimism that those connections can still be nurtured and survive the current gyrations of the stock market or the economy itself.
“I’m very confident that we have such strong ties that those will stand strong during these times,” she said. “But it is difficult.”

(Photo Credit: Sean Rayford/Getty Images)Three weeks after a hostile town hall in Asheville, U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards (NC-11) found himself before a more reserved audience of business owners in which he expressed support for President Donald Trump’s tariffs.
“I do not blindly support the idea of tariffs, but I do support the theory that the president has brought to us,” Rep. Edwards told his audience Friday at UNC-Asheville.
Edwards said the American people elected Trump to a second term knowing his position on imposing tariffs.
“President Trump is the master, he’s an author of the art of the deal. With everything that he does, he considers it a negotiation,” Edwards explained.
Edwards said in order to get bordering countries to do their part to secure the U.S.  border, or foreign countries to do their part to prevent drugs or human trafficking from coming across the border, the president needed leverage.
“And if you don’t have leverage, you create leverage.”
Edwards recounted a recent appearance on a Canadian television station in which he was asked to explain the U.S. position on tariffs.
“I explained to them that this was an opening move…to get Canada to do some things, to help both themselves and the United States, and create a stronger and better world.”
In the hour-long event streamed by WLOS, Edwards told members of the Council of Independent Business Owners (CIBO) that he believes Americans owe it to the president to give tariffs a chance.
“Someone asked me, ‘Well, how long do you give it?’ I can’t set a hard-firm rule. I believe that we need to closely look over the president’s shoulder, listen to the negotiations that are going on, and look at the results of tariffs, and then make up our minds.”
 Anxiety over market volatility 
On Monday, Trump threatened even steeper tariffs on China this week while denying his administration would place a 90 day pause on his tariff plan for further negotiations.
That erased the one positive gain in the stock market Monday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to close down another 349 points. The Wall Street Journal pegged last week’s U.S. market losses at $6 trillion.
JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon and billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman have also warned the Trump’s tariffs could lead to an economic downturn for consumers.
“We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices,” Dimon said in an annual shareholder letter.
A new survey released Monday by WalletHub finds that nearly half of Americans are concerned that tariffs will make their credit card debt worse.
Still, Edwards said he has had success in getting the White House to provide relief on some textile tariffs.
“And if I need to go back to the president and say, I want you to rethink this, or rethink [that], then I’ll certainly do that.”

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-04-08 10:35:26+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,Newark teens gear up for school board elections after voting age extended to 16,"Lauren Gill, Bolts",,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/04/08/newark-teens-gear-up-for-school-board-elections-after-voting-age-extended-to-16/,This year's school board race in Newark is the first election in which 16- and 17-year-olds who live in the district can cast a ballot.,"Candidates share their visions for Newark schools with students at a youth-led forum on March 22. (Photo by Lauren Gill/Bolts)This article was originally published in Bolts, a nonprofit newsroom covering the nuts and bolts of power and political change, from the local up.
On a Saturday in March, approximately 60 teenagers sat in a movie theater at CityPlex12 in Newark, New Jersey eating popcorn and drinking fountain sodas. A DJ played songs by Mary J. Blige and André 3000. It wasn’t a typical Saturday at the movies—the teens were there for a youth-led forum with candidates for their school board. Over the next 90 minutes, the young people listened to candidates answer questions about their priorities, how they’d address disparities in resources, and their plans for strengthening the connection between schools and families.
Many of the teenagers were considering those questions for the first time. In 2024, Newark became the third city in the U.S., and first in New Jersey, to allow 16-and-17-year-olds to vote in school board elections. The change was spurred by a student-led campaign aimed at giving young people more power at the polls.
On April 15, eleven candidates are running for three seats on the nine-member board that governs the Newark School District, the first election in which 16- and 17-year-olds who live in the district can cast a ballot. As the election approaches, students are seizing on the opportunity to make their voices heard.
“It feels very good,” Collins Esubonteng, 16, told Bolts. Esubonteng and six other students coordinated the forum with the help of The Gem Project, a Newark organization that promotes youth leadership. “Now, they’re actually gonna have to listen to us and they have to make changes to cater to us or else they won’t get our vote.”
Newark is the largest city in New Jersey and home to the largest school district in the state. Roughly 40,000 students attend its 63 schools, and 90 percent of students are either Black or Hispanic. Under the new rules, approximately 6,500 teens were eligible to register. (Registration applied to all 16- and 17-year-olds in Newark, regardless of the type of school they attend). As of the March 25 deadline, 1,796 young people, or 28 percent, had registered to vote.
Newark’s elected school board members play a large role in influencing education in the city, from overseeing and approving the district’s yearly budget—$1.5 billion in 2024—to making decisions about wide-reaching policies such as curriculum and school lunches. Even with that responsibility, just a small number of adults vote in their elections. Last year’s Newark school board election saw just a three percent voter turnout,and no candidate received more than 3,000 votes.

By lowering the voting age, Newark joins Oakland and Berkeley on the opposite coast in becoming the only U.S. cities in which 16- and 17-year-olds have a say in who sits on their school boards. Two Bay Area cities, plus cities in Vermont and Maryland have also lowered the voting age by allowing kids to vote in local elections.
Countries including Austria and Nicaragua have lowered the national voting age to below 18 for all elections. Research on these countries shows that allowing young people to start voting earlier can increase voter turnout over time. The expansion of youth voting in Newark last year has inspired other New Jersey cities to follow by introducing similar ordinances. It’s also inspired legislation to lower the voting age for school board elections across the state.
“It’s just powerful to see how the students… can vote and actually have an impact on their education and things that they really feel like is pressing—they can actually have a voice,” said Nathaniel Esubonteng, an 18-year-old who helped lead Newark’s campaign.
The push to lower the vote age in Newark began in 2020 when Yenjay Hu and Anjali Krishnamurti, then freshmen and sophomores in high school, grew frustrated with how little say they had in shaping what went on in their schools. Hoping to change that, the pair formed Vote16NJ, the New Jersey branch of the national organization Vote 16 that campaigns to expand voting rights to 16- and 17-year-olds.
The Newark teenagers started with trying to enact sweeping statewide change but faced problems winning support, partly because the idea was new to policy circles. Eventually, Vote16NJ connected with the Institute for Social Justice, a racial and social advocacy organization in Newark that was interested in pursuing the reform. Strengthening their argument, Hu and Krishnamurti discovered that the New Jersey constitution permits local councils to change the voting age.
Krishnamurti says they soon saw other advantages to starting in Newark, the most populous city in New Jersey with the largest school district in the state. The low voter turnout in previous elections showed the necessity for including young people and the city was already home to a large contingent of civically involved students, said Krishnamurti. The pair of teen advocates also recognized that, because of its size, other cities have historically ended up adopting Newark ordinances.
“We hoped it would set a precedent for the entire state,” Hu, now a student at Yale University, told Bolts.
In January 2024, the Newark City Council voted to pass an ordinance lowering the voting age, noting that the move would strengthen democracy in the city.
Krishnamurti, now a student at Harvard University, called the upcoming Newark election “surreal.” “I think this is just the start of what is going to be a really, really long movement of young people advocating for their own rights,” she said.
The election is just the beginning, though, said Krishnamurti and Hu. They say VOTE16NJ started with school boards because city council members wanted to first see how expanded youth voting went in those elections before considering expanding it further. The group now hopes to eventually change the voting age for the rest of local government elections.
Newark organizers, schools, and students have taken the lead on registering the new swath of young voters. City youth-focused organizations have been working with schools to educate students about their newfound power by hosting registration events and forums. Last month, Governor Phil Murphy visited a Newark high school along with rapper A Boogie Wit da Hoodie to encourage students to vote. Students have also been canvassing to register their peers.

Assatta Mann, senior community organizer at the New Jersey Institute for Social Justice, told Bolts that organizers faced challenges with making kids aware of their right to vote and getting them up to speed with how to register. Changing the voting age for this election required an overhaul of the New Jersey Division of Elections registration system and the agency wasn’t ready to open the rolls until February 1, leaving only two months for kids to register. “Those are some of the major challenges we’re facing, and that’s just around registration, let alone actually then making sure people get to the polls.”
The reform has also influenced how school board candidates are campaigning. One candidate, Jordy Nivar, told Bolts that he coaches youth baseball and he educated his team about youth voting at practices. All of the eligible students on his team are registered, said Nivar, and showed Bolts a video of them holding up his campaign flyers.
“I didn’t have to push it too much,” said Nivar. “They always figured, listen, if coach is doing this, we got to support him because he always supported us.”
Kanileah Anderson, the only incumbent running for the board, said that she’s made a point to talk in person with students about her platform. She’s seen a change with board meeting attendance, too—the previous week, about 20 students attended a budget meeting. “Parent participation is dismal,” she said. “If somebody’s going to participate, why not the kids, the consumer of the actual product?”
Nakyah Hepdema, a 16-year-old who registered to vote at the forum in March, told Bolts that she wanted the school board to provide more vocational opportunities. “I feel like what’s missing is stuff for careers,” she said.
Hepdema’s friend, Tarayah Shenck, also 16, wants better training for teachers. “Maybe it’s just me but I feel like teachers don’t break down stuff more,” she told Bolts. Newark’s reform follows efforts to lower the voting age in other U.S. cities. Teens in Oakland and Berkeley, California, voted in school board elections for the first time in 2024. Youth turnout was low, with just 600 out of 1,500 registered teens showing up to vote.
In 2013, the Washington D.C. suburb of Takoma Park, Maryland, became the first place in the U.S. to allow 16- and 17-year-olds to vote in mayoral and city council elections as a way to increase voter turnout and youth interest in civic engagement. In subsequent elections, youths voted at higher rates than the rest of the population, according to a study by Generation Citizen, an advocacy group that boosts civics education.
Newark’s success has inspired two more New Jersey cities to lower the voting age to 16 for school board elections. An ordinance in Atlantic City cleared legal review while one in Jersey City is still undergoing evaluation.
Meanwhile, a bill to expand the right to vote throughout New Jersey is pending in the legislature. Governor Murphy, a Democrat, has voiced his support for the legislation. He also wants to provide financial incentives for the change and proposed allocating $1 million to places that lower the voting age for help with IT and voter education as part of his 2026 budget.
As election day approaches in Newark, students are gearing up to vote. Outside of the forum, young people told Bolts that voting had become a big topic of conversation in their friend circles and were optimistic that lowering the voting age will boost voter turnout.
“I really do feel empowered when I can vote,” said Gabrielly Ferreira, 16. “My ideas and what I want for my education are now being put out there. So I honestly do believe that the turnout will be much greater than last year’s. And then I also really hope for other students to recognize that in the coming years.”
Zoe Umchukwu, 17, put it plainly: “The power is actually being given to the people. Now it’s not just other people trying to decide what’s best for us, trying to decide what we need and what we want.”",https://newjerseymonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_2203-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-08 07:01:54.216673

(Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)In the moments before the 2025 Idaho legislative session came to a close Friday, Republican legislative leaders called a press conference where they heralded the combined passage of more than $400 million worth of tax cuts this year.
The cuts reduce the income tax rates Idahoans and businesses pay, shift money to a state fund used to to reduce property taxes, shift money to another state fund to pay down public school bond issues and levies that are paid for by property taxes and increase the grocery tax credit that is used to offset $155 worth of sales tax Idahoans pay on food.
House Speaker Mike Moyle, R-Star, said the overall downward trend is good for the state.
But at the end of this year a different tax credit that has benefited Idaho families for seven years is set to expire with much less fanfare than the new cuts.

Before Jan. 1, the Idaho Child Tax Credit will expire. Passed by the 2018 Idaho Legislature – and co-sponsored by Moyle – the Idaho Child Tax Credit provides a $205 nonrefundable tax credit for each taxpayer’s child under age 17. 
The Idaho Child Tax Credit law was written so that it would be in effect from Jan. 1, 2018 to before Jan. 1, 2026, and the Idaho Legislature did not extend it before adjourning the 2025 legislative session for the year. 
Although the new 2025 tax cuts are making headlines this week, analysts with the nonpartisan Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy said many Idaho families who don’t own property won’t experience overall tax relief this year because of the expiration of the Idaho Child Tax Credit.
Dominated by a series of tax cuts, Idaho Legislature adjourns 2025 legislative session

When taken into consideration with House Bill 40 and House Bill 231, Idaho families earning between $31,100 and $146,000 annually won’t see any tax benefit, the Idaho Center For Fiscal Policy said in a report on its website. Idaho families making between $55,600 and $91,800 should expect to see an overall tax increase of about $100, the center wrote.
“Idaho lawmakers have made significant cuts to the state’s income tax to provide tax relief to Idahoans this year, but with the expiration of our state Child Tax Credit, most families won’t experience any tax relief,” May Roberts, a policy analyst at the Idaho Center for Fiscal Policy, wrote in a statement. 
Roberts said Idaho legislators could have taken action to ensure low and middle class families aren’t left behind by renewing the Idaho Child Tax Credit, incorporating an income cap, and making the credit refundable. 
For Idaho homeowners and property owners, House Bill 304 provides an additional $100 million in state revenue meant to reduce property taxes and pay down school bonds and levies, which was not included in the Idaho Center For Fiscal Policy reports.
  Expiration of Idaho Child Tax Credit shows shifting priorities for Idaho legislators 

The 2018 Idaho Legislature created the Idaho Child Tax Credit through the income tax conformity bill House Bill 463, and then came back and expanded the amount of the credit to $205 per child through House Bill 675 that same year.

The Idaho House of Representatives voted unanimously to pass House Bill 675, which included legislative intent language spelling out the Idaho Legislature’s priorities. The language says that it is the Idaho Legislature’s intent to take an anticipated increase in sales tax revenues collections stemming from a new law collecting Idaho sales tax from out-of-state retailers, and apply toward income tax relief for Idaho families. 
But, now seven years later, the Idaho Legislature’s intent appears to have changed. 
During a press conference Friday, Moyle told the Sun legislators that the expiration of the Idaho Child Tax Credit was brought up this year, but legislators chose to focus on cutting taxes in other areas.
“I think we were more focused on tax relief for everybody with the income (tax) that covered everybody, the property (tax) that covered everybody and the schools and the sales tax,” Moyle said. “So we were more focused on those areas that touched everybody.”
House Majority Leader Jason Monks, R-Meridian, agreed with Moyle.
“We knew about it, it was coming up, but we had other priorities,” Monks said. “As the speaker mentioned, we were going to address those big issues that we’ve been hearing from our constituents and from the people of Idaho to address. They want property tax relief and they want tax relief, and that’s what we provided for them.”

Mike Gaskill defends the election-related study legislation he is sponsoring on Monday, April 7, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Twenty-eight lines instructing embattled Indiana Secretary of State Diego Morales to analyze vote center and municipal election year changes ensnarled the Senate for almost 40 minutes Monday — but, after a 35-13 vote, the bill heads to the Gov. Mike Braun’s desk.
So do measures disallowing student identification cards as proof of identity and cutting income taxes. Across the Statehouse, the House approved towing regulations after months of strife within the Republican supermajority.
“In the amount of time that we spent debating it, I could have read it word-for-word about 20 times. I’m just flabbergasted,” said Sen. Mike Gaskill of the bipartisan pushback to House Bill 1633. Gaskill, R-Pendleton, was the legislation’s sponsor.

It would direct Morales to estimate any cost savings reaped if Indiana were to require that all counties move from traditional precinct-based voting to a vote center model, which allows voters to cast ballots at any location within their county of residence on Election Day. He’d do the same for municipal election changes, comparing the current schedule — odd-numbered years before presidential elections — to even-numbered presidential and midterm years.
Morales would also have to study potential impacts on voter turnout, conduct at least one public meeting in each of the three specified regions and report the results to lawmakers by November. House Bill 1633 goes into effect upon passage.
At the microphone, Democrats and Republicans revealed distrust of Morales. Questionable spending and other missteps have prompted, in recent weeks, greater scrutiny of the state’s chief elections officer’s fiscal management. 
“I’m sorry. I just cannot give Secretary Morales any more after he has demonstrated — about catering meals, a Hungary trip, an India trip, no-bid contracts, hiring family, (spot) bonuses to his staff, a $90,000 car,” said Sen. J.D. Ford, D-Indianapolis. “I just can’t support giving him any more of this.”
“I’m not opposed to studying elections … (but) I do have a problem with the secretary of state getting on a traveling road show … just like I object to gold whistles and notebooks and lanyards in an election year,” said Sen. Sue Glick, R-LaGrange. “We only have so much money in this state. I think this is a waste of time and money.”

Ford, Glick and others also took issue with the study’s format.
They noted that the Legislature usually studies desired public policy changes through interim study committees. Those bodies feature representation from both parties, both chambers and, sometimes, agencies or industry. 
 IDs, tax measures also cross finish line

The chamber additionally concurred with House edits to Senate bills.
Sen. Blake Doriot, R-Goshen, reported two sets of changes to his Senate Bill 10. The legislation would no longer allow students at Indiana’s public colleges and universities to use their institutional IDs as proof of identity at the polls.
One Republican-authored amendment altered voter list maintenance and data-sharing language — requiring county voter registration offices to perform voter list maintenance within just 48 hours of receiving certain information — while a Democratic one added consular reports of births abroad to a list of documents proving U.S. citizenship.
Democrats maintained strong opposition to the measure, which goes to the governor on a 39-9 vote.
“We are told that this bill is about election integrity, but let’s ask ourselves the hard question: where is the fraud? … Where is the abuse of student IDs in our elections?” Senate Minority Leader Shelli Yoder, D-Bloomington, asked. 
Legislation paring down Indiana’s individual income tax also made the cut, on a 48-0 vote.
Senate Bill 451 would drop the rate by 0.05% beginning in 2030, if state general fund revenue collections exceed 3.5% growth in each of the four preceding fiscal years. The next year’s revenue forecast also must be at least 3.5%. The House bumped the baseline requirement up.
The reductions would continue in every even-numbered year through 2040.
Current law is already phasing Indiana’s flat income tax rate down from 3.05% in 2024 to: 3.0% in 2025, 2.95% in 2026, and 2.9% in 2027 and years thereafter.
Each 0.05 percentage point reduction of tax rate would result in a decline of income tax revenues between $150 million to $200 million annually, according to a fiscal analysis for the legislation.
 Towing, marijuana advertising clear House at least

After months of wrangling fellow Republicans, House lawmakers approved an overhauled utility trailer sales bill that now addresses “predatory” towing practices — and seeks to ban advertising of marijuana and other drugs. It advances back to the Senate for that chamber’s consent to the changes.

There was no discussion before the 75-13 tally on Senate Bill 73, but nearly all of the “no” votes came from members of the majority caucus: Reps. Beau Baird, R-Greencastle; Martin Carbaugh, R-Fort Wayne; Lori Goss-Reaves, R-Marion; Craig Haggard, R-Mooresville; Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis; Chris Jeter, R-Fishers; Chris Judy, R-Fort Wayne; Ethan Manning, R-Logansport; Bob Morris, R-Fort Wayne; Zach Payne R-Charlestown; Kyle Pierce, R-Anderson; and Jake Teshka, R-North Liberty. 
Rep. Kyle Miller, of Fort Wayne, was the only Democrat in opposition.
Under Rep. Jim Pressel’s watchful eye, a Senate committee last month inserted an outdoor marijuana advertising ban and towing provisions into an Indiana Department of Motor Vehicles agency bill. They came out last week, when Senate Appropriations Committee chair Sen. Ryan Mishler dubbed them non-germane. But Pressel, R-Rolling Prairie, had already taken over Senate Bill 73 for the expanded advertising ban and towing changes.
Towing regulations previously tripped up House Republicans for more than two weeks during the first half of the legislative session, before meeting a deadline-induced death. Another take on the regulations died even earlier, in committee.

Merv Riepe, the Ralston lawmaker at the nexus of controversy the past three years since returning to the Nebraska Legislature, isn’t afraid to go against his Republican colleagues.
Riepe returned to the Legislature in January 2023 after losing a reelection bid to his predecessor in 2018. While his first term was more in line with the then-Nebraska Republican Party — which he notes was different, too — his return has positioned him differently, as more of an independent thinker and pivotal vote on many proposals, earning him the short-lived title of “Hot Merv Summer.”
From new abortion restrictions, Medicaid expansion and gender-related care to sports and bathrooms for transgender students, winner-take-all and criminal justice for teen offenders, the 82-year-old Riepe found a spotlight he says he never intended to seek.

“Hell no,” he says when asked whether he sought to often be the key “33rd vote” — the threshold to cut off debate on contentious measures. But he’s not bashful in doing so.
“If I’m the 33rd vote to kill something, then I say, ‘OK.’ If I feel strongly about it, I will do that, regardless of what the consequences are,” Riepe told the Nebraska Examiner during a two-hour interview in his office last month.
“The only rule I’ve ever had is anyone can say anything about me, just don’t say anything about my mom,” he continued. “I don’t want to be on the bench. I want to be in the game.”
Winner-take-all: ‘Today is a new day’
Nearly two years from when he killed a near-total abortion ban, and more than a year since he withheld a vote a sponsor needed to advance the “Sports and Spaces Act” to restrict K-12 bathrooms and sports to students’ sex at birth, Riepe’s more independent flame could burn bright again this week.
Tuesday marks a four-hour debate on Legislative Bill 3, which seeks to return Nebraska to “winner-take-all” for its five Electoral College votes. Currently, just Nebraska and Maine split two presidential votes for the statewide winner and one presidential vote for the winner of each congressional district. Nebraska has split its votes three times — 2008, 2020 and 2024.

Vice President Kamala Harris won Riepe’s Ralston and Omaha district in November by 2.3% over President Donald Trump. She also won the “blue dot” in the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District. Riepe is the only Republican in the Legislature representing a Harris-won legislative district.
Yet Tuesday won’t be the first time Riepe has voted on winner-take-all. He supported the change all four times it came up for a vote in 2015 and 2016. He also voted for it last year on a procedural attempt by former State Sen. Julie Slama of Dunbar to attach the proposal to a different bill.
In an April 2024 floor speech on Slama’s efforts, Riepe said: “A vote for winner-take-all might be the one critical vote to keep Sleepy Joe from the White House.” Riepe is four months older than former President Joe Biden.
Last September, U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., went to the Nebraska Governor’s Mansion to give Gov. Jim Pillen backup in the continued push, connecting Riepe and Trump on a brief call. 
Riepe said Trump praised the governor and added: “Senator Riepe, I’ve heard of you.”
“He never heard of me,” Riepe recalled last month with a laugh. “I’m not so vain that I think that he — it was just what you say when you’re schmoozing with someone.”

Riepe that day signed on to support winner-take-all that fall, but Riepe said Pillen “naively” took that signature as indicative of future support, which he called a “bad assumption.” Pillen and his team shared screenshots of Riepe’s past votes and the signature this weekend.
“It’s like an Etch A Sketch, you pull it and it’s gone, and we start over,” Riepe said. “I don’t consider that a flip-flop. I consider it a situational decision.”
‘A situational decision’
What was the difference in 2024? Harris and Biden.
Riepe felt strongly that Harris was not “even remotely qualified” and might be a “puppet for some behind-the-scene bureaucratic process.” He said he refused to live with the idea that Nebraska’s “blue dot” could decide the election.
Riepe gave Trump his vote, both in the pledged signature to Pillen and later at the ballot box. He said he wasn’t “head over heels” for Trump. But he was firmly against Harris.
“To keep her from coming in there if it meant my vote, I would throw myself on the fire to do that,” Riepe said.

Riepe said he feels that people in his district want to keep the district model. Civic Nebraska hosted a “community conversation” Monday night urging Nebraskans to share support for the current electoral method. Riepe said he had planned to attend that event in his district.
Maine leaders have vowed to follow Nebraska if winner-take-all is enacted, Riepe noted, which he argued would be a “sum-zero game.”
“So what have we done? We’ve just stirred the beehive for no honey,” Riepe said.
Defining ‘moderate’
Riepe described politics as a bell curve where most people fall in the center. He said he doesn’t “subscribe” to what he often considers “extreme positions” of the NEGOP platform.
State Sen. Tom Brandt of Plymouth, a farmer in his seventh year at the statehouse, said Riepe brings perspectives that he leans on. He calls Riepe a “fun guy” with a “thick hide.”
“He makes up his mind and he sticks with it, I really admire that about him,” Brandt said. “It would take some very solid logic to get him off of his position.”
State Sen. Jana Hughes of Seward, who was elected alongside Riepe in 2022, described Riepe as a “fiscal hawk” and said that “for being the oldest senator, he has the strongest backbone.”
Riepe described his political position as “center, slightly right.” He has often said he’s a “compassionate conservative.” He considers himself moderate but isn’t a typical swing vote.

Brandt and others have similarly fallen into the “moderate” category, but he rejected the label.
“I see us as the Republicans,” Brandt said. “Maybe the other ones are out of step, and maybe we’re in step.”
Riepe has supported reducing unemployment benefits from 26 weeks to 16 weeks, and he’s advancing a criminal justice package backed by Pillen this year to lower the age at which juveniles can be detained or charged as adults.
He also helped with property tax negotiations in the summer of 2024 but criticized the fast-paced and ever-changing process as a “jump-and-the-net-will-appear” philosophy.
The health-focused ‘wildcat’
Riepe, a farm kid who joined the U.S. Navy hospital corpsmen at the age of 17 in 1960 and served until just before his 21st birthday, came back and worked his way through school. He said he always intended to be a hospital administrator, as he did until his retirement in 2008. He held top roles at Bergen Mercy Medical Center and what is now Children’s Nebraska.

Health care has dominated Riepe’s focus in the Legislature, such as:

Expanding options for direct primary care.


Adding blood testing options for pregnant women to fight syphilis.


Funding respite facilities for eligible homeless adults in Lincoln and Omaha.


Allowing emergency medical services to care for and transport injured Nebraska K-9s.

Riepe also takes a narrow view on expanding Medicaid, opposing an in-progress bill to cap the costs of epinephrine injectors for severe allergic reactions while having previously brought a measure to expand Medicaid coverage to include obesity for potential cost savings. He also opposed a 2023 bill to repeal the state’s helmet law for motorcyclists, citing potential Medicaid costs.
Partnering with Hughes, Riepe has defended a currently stalled partnership with Iowa for a prescription drug donation program, potentially for Medicaid savings. Riepe also predated Hughes in seeking to combat youth tobacco use and vaping.

State Sen. John Fredrickson, a progressive who like Riepe represents a more purple district in Omaha, described Riepe as a “wildcat” because it can be hard to know where he might land on certain topics. To some that might be “wishy-washy,” Fredrickson said, yet Riepe is the “exact opposite.”
“I think he’s someone who is curious. We joke that he’s Curious George, and he’s someone who I hope, when I’m Merv’s age, that I am still wanting to learn as much as he is,” said Fredrickson, who is 38.
Fredrickson, vice chair of the Legislature’s Health and Human Services Committee, said he’s a better lawmaker because of Riepe and that the two help one another, especially on an all-male committee for the first time since 2004. 
Riepe chaired the HHS Committee in 2017 and 2018 and lost a bid to return on a 28-21 vote this January.
‘The straw that broke the camel’s back’
Riepe’s fascination with health also got him reading more about abortion in 2023, leading to his “change of heart” from LB 626, which sought to ban nearly all abortions after an ultrasound detected embryonic cardiac activity. He viewed that as a “total abortion ban” before most women know they’re pregnant.
He signaled his opposition early and pushed for a 12-week cutoff. He has said that if his 2022 election had gone just a few more weeks, citing headwinds after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, he might have lost.
During the second-round debate on LB 626 in April 2023, Riepe tried to force a vote on his 12-week amendment. Lt. Gov. Joe Kelly, instead of putting the motion to an immediate vote as he typically does, ruled there hadn’t been “full and fair debate.”
“I tell you what, I was mad,” Riepe said.
Reflecting on the vote last month, Riepe paused and walked over to grab a coffee mug from his office. It bore the German flag and read: “Never underestimate the power of a stubborn German.”
  State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston got this mug gifted to him from State Sen. Jane Raybould of Lincoln featuring the German flag in line with Riepe’s heritage, stating, “Never underestimate the power of a stubborn German.” March 11, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Riepe said his independent streak had started before that LB 626 debate, but the maneuvering around his amendment “was the straw that broke the camel’s back.”
“It made me so angry that they had maneuvered to not even give me a shot,” Riepe said. “They were that determined to not only kill my bill but in essence shut me up, and that really, that may have been the trigger that made me say, ‘Fine, you want to smack me, I’ll smack you back.’”
When the allotted four hours passed on former Thurston State Sen. Joni Albrecht’s LB 626, Riepe withheld his vote, and so entered “Hot Merv Summer,” a term used by abortion-rights advocates, including on T-shirts, praising Riepe for torpedoing the stricter measure. Riepe said he got one of the shirts and wore it once, to the end-of-session legislative party in 2023.
‘Hot Merv Summer’
Riepe’s non-vote and opposition to LB 626 earned him a censure from the NEGOP, a local billboard from Students for Life Action calling for his resignation, the loss of his Nebraska Right to Life endorsement and an open letter in the McCook Gazette from a southwestern Nebraska county party chair blasting Riepe for an “11th-hour bargain with the Devil.”
“Senator Riepe, you shall be remembered as a shadow of a man, who prized political expediency over integrity,” Bruce Desautels, then-chair of the Hitchcock County Republican Party, wrote in May 2023. “As went the legacy of Judas Iscariot and General Benedict Arnold, yours shall ever be synonymous with dishonor and betrayal.”
Riepe said he didn’t feel threatened after that vote but did have people show up at his house and church. Pillen, who supported LB 626, offered security if it became a problem, Riepe said.

One of the people that Riepe earned praise from was his son, who told his father: “It’s one of my proudest moments to be your son, that you had the guts to take that kind of a vote.”
With a laugh, Riepe said he replied: “Well, that’s good. So I can expect something nice for Father’s Day?”
Riepe said he wears the censure as a “badge of courage” that helps in his purple district, and he joked that at least the southwest Omaha billboard featured a nice picture of him.
“Being a stubborn German, give me an ultimatum, I’m just stubborn enough I’m likely to go the opposite way,” Riepe said.
Behind the scenes, Riepe continued working with conservatives to find a path forward for abortion restrictions, which became the current law: 12 weeks tied to gestational age. The abortion language was added to LB 574, which on its own prohibited gender transition surgeries for minors and restricted youths with gender dysphoria from accessing certain medications.
Riepe said his support for LB 574, beyond abortion, had come after meeting a family who said their two-year-old child was transgender, which he said left him speechless. He said he was concerned that age was too early to know.
The new amendment was filed May 8, ending “Hot Merv Summer” just 11 days later.
‘A great deal of growth’
Abortion and gender care restrictions were combined on May 16, 2023, in what State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha described as one of the worst days of her life. She warned Riepe against supporting the measures and said women and children would die.

She told supporters: “You will have buckets and buckets of blood on your hands.”
Cavanaugh said it was heartbreaking and “really, really, really difficult to move past,” yet Riepe reflected and said he regretted not pushing harder to include fatal fetal anomalies as an exception and not fighting to explicitly repeal criminal penalties against doctors for abortions.
Riepe tried to do so in 2024 but had few political allies to help move the measure forward.
“Obviously, I’m still upset. We can’t go back and undo it. But there is something in acknowledging our mistakes and trying to do better moving forward,” Cavanaugh said. “While it was a horrible moment, I think it also resulted in a great deal of growth for him.”
LB 574 passed May 19, cementing a summer of, as Riepe offered: “He’s not as hot as we thought.”.
Cavanaugh and Riepe both served on the HHS Committee in 2023, where the two had a relationship akin to Statler and Waldorf, two grouchy older Muppets often seen from the balcony of a theater, Cavanaugh said. It was a relationship similar to Fredrickson and Riepe now, rooted, they said, in good policy.
“He’s one of the rare animals in here who you can still actually engage in thoughtful policy discussion with and who will come to the table and have those conversations,” Fredrickson said.
‘Right to vote his conscience’
Legislation impacting transgender Nebraskans would again be debated in 2024, with Riepe placing himself at the center of that debate, too — LB 575, or the “Sports and Spaces Act” from State Sen. Kathleen Kauth of the Millard area.

While LB 574 and LB 626 were fought publicly, Riepe had privately raised caution in a March 2023 memo to Kauth, suggesting that they leave the fight up to the State Board of Education while quoting a Chinese general that “The greatest victory is that which requires no battle.”
The issue would wait until April 2024, after Riepe had spent months meeting with families and continuing to read. He remarked during the debate that trans students and families were seeking accommodations, not attention.
He asked how to know a child’s chromosomes by looking at them: “Are they like shirt sizes? Are they an ‘X’ and a double ‘X’ or triple ‘X,’ and what are they?”
Riepe and Brandt were the two Republican senators to be “present, not voting” on the bill, ending its chances for the year. Riepe maintains his “leaning” opposition to the latest version of Kauth’s bill, the “Stand With Women Act,” LB 89. It could come up for debate at any time.

Riepe has said he holds that position partly because of executive action by Trump forcing schools to restrict sports to students’ sex at birth or risk federal funding. Riepe said he wants a national solution, not a state-by-state patchwork.
Kauth, who succeeded Riepe as chair of the Business and Labor Committee, said she respects Riepe and “his right to vote his conscience, whether it’s the same worldview as mine or not.”
“We have more in common than we do apart and have worked together on important issues and will do so in the future,” she said in a text.
Riepe’s future
Riepe knows he is the oldest member of the Nebraska Legislature. But he walks in parades and goes door to door in part to prove he has the stamina, he says, and that he can still put two sentences together.
“I’m not some babbling old fool,” Riepe said. “I’m just an old fool.”

Whether Riepe runs for reelection in 2026 is still up in the air, largely depending on his health and whether his wife is agreeable, he says smiling. He feels good where he is at and has communicated to others, including the governor’s office, that they’re in a “tough spot” should they try to primary him.
“You can’t run someone to the right of me, really, and ever get elected,” Riepe said. “And you’re not going to run somebody on the left.”
Should Riepe run and win reelection, he would be 88 by the time he is term-limited at the end of 2030. But should he lose, or decide against running, he won’t “go home and cry.”
Instead, he said he’ll try to figure out which hardware store he can go to and “sort nuts and bolts.”
Asked how he wants to be remembered, Riepe said:
“He was a decent guy who appreciated some humor and, hopefully, was a reasonable individual who was a good parent, a good husband and things that are above and more important than the Legislature. I don’t want them at my funeral saying, ‘I know ol’ Riepe would have wished he would have spent another session stuck on the floor during some filibuster.’”

The deadline for applications is coming up on May 2 to apply for Sage Grouse Action Team grant funds from the Idaho Governor’s Office of Species Conservation. Funds for successful applications will be available by July 1, 2025. 
A number of Idaho soil and water conservation districts have applied for Sage Grouse Action Team grant funds in the past, including the Butte, Wood River and Bruneau districts, leading to successful conservation projects. 
Funding for individual grant projects ranges from $2,000 to $218,000 per year, said Josh Uriarte, project manager for the Office of Species Conservation. The agency receives $750,000 in general funds for work on sage grouse that includes restoration, wildfire rehabilitation, surveys, fire equipment and employee time each year, he said. 
About $550,000 to $600,000 is available for projects this year, Uriarte said. Fifteen projects were funded last year. 
“There is a lot of potential overlap between district goals, landowners’ objectives to improve or protect their range and livestock grazing, and balanced sage grouse habitat management,” said George Hitz, Soil and Water Conservation deputy director. 
“Idaho’s conservation districts take a lead role in helping landowners make timely effective land management decisions,” he said. “For conservation districts containing sage grouse management areas, I think this could be an excellent Idaho-sourced funding opportunity for conservation to support a diverse rangeland ecosystem and to help ranching thrive. I encourage districts to look into it along with any potential participants or partners and see if the opportunity fits.”
The types of projects that have been funded in the past include wet meadow habitat projects, re-seeding projects to restore the range post-fire or to eliminate invasive grasses, slash treatment projects in areas where juniper trees are being removed to enhance sage grouse habitat, fuel breaks projects and more. 
 Background from the Idaho Governor’s Office of Species Conservation website

 In May 2015, the state agencies charged with implementing the governor’s strategy – including the Office of Species Conservation, Idaho Department of Lands, and the Idaho Department of Fish and Game – established the Sage Grouse Actions Team, along with local federal agency partners including the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Land Management and and the National Resources Conservation Service. The Idaho Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Idaho Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Forest Service and The Nature Conservancy also are part of the group.
The team works collaboratively to prioritize and fund actions in accordance with the governor’s strategy. Priorities for funding include helping equip Rangeland Fire Protection Associations to improve fire suppression capabilities, build strategic fuel breaks to slow the spread of wildfire, restore areas that have been degraded by wildfire from encroached juniper trees and annual grasses, restore and improve brood rearing habitat, and enhance the monitoring of sage grouse activity.
In fiscal year 2024, 15 conservation projects were funded by the Sage Grouse Action Team, which on average leveraged $3.57 non-state dollars for every state dollar spent to implement projects, Uriarte said. 
These efforts resulted in more than $2.8 million in collaborative conservation. There were also 10 Rangeland Fire Protection Associations assisted with an offset to their insurance, wildland firefighting tools and protective equipment for over $52,000. Many times, the state general fund dollars are used as match to bring other funding sources to Idaho such as the Cheatgrass Challenge and grants through the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation.
Here is a list of the fiscal year 2024 projects that were funded: 

2,538 acres – conifer treatment
3,122 acres – annual grass treatment
1,318 acres of post-fire rehabilitation
62 acres of wet meadow enhancement and 5 miles of stream work
393 acres of fuel breaks

 Conservation District projects 

Hammond Springs – Butte Soil and Water Conservation District – worked with a landowner and Natural Resources Conservation Service to install check dams in the fall of 2018 to trap sediment and help reconnect the creek with its flood plain. In addition, they removed cattle water troughs located in a riparian area, returned springflow to the creek, and moved the water troughs off-site to uplands, and installed a well, solar pump and pipeline to route water to them.  
In 2020, Butte SWCD received funding for a no-till drill and Wood River SWCD got funds for a rangeland drill for seeding projects.
Bruneau SWCD – beaver dam analogs on Hurry Up/Hurry Back creek with Bruneau rancher Chris Black on his private land in Owyhee County. The first BDAs were installed initially by a Utah Conservation Corps crew, who worked on the project in coordination with Utah State University. 
Conservation professionals with OSC, SWC, U.S. FWS, IDFG and NRCS were all interested in exploring the benefits of using beaver dam analogs to improve riparian habitat and store water. They assisted the landowner and Utah crews with project management and implementation.
Beaver dam analogs are woody structures made with local materials such as willow branches attached to vertical posts pounded into a creek-bottom that mimic the natural work of beavers. The beaver dam analogs create pond habitat, spread out the water table, and slow down runoff in the spring. 
They started with 10 beaver dam analogs on Chris Black’s property, and added more over the next several years. 
“They came in and put them in very successfully,” Black said in a story and video produced on the project by Life on the Range, a public education project sponsored by the Idaho Rangeland Resources Commission. “They’re backing water up, they’re creating habitat for spotted frogs, for sage grouse, for beaver.”
“It just benefits a whole host of wildlife species and that’s why Fish and Game is really interested in this,” says Chris Yarbrough, habitat biologist for the Idaho Department of Fish and Game. “It’s a low-cost way to get a lot of bang for your conservation buck.”
“These meadows are like a sponge,” Black explains. “They take that water and they hold it, and release it slowly into the system. So we don’t get that big rush in the spring, when the springs are active, they run hard and then just dry up. Then you just have a dry meadow. With water being held back in the system, it releases slowly, and that benefits downstream users, too, so it’s a benefit for everything.”
Black has a healthy sage grouse population that live part of the year on his private ranchland and part of the year on public lands nearby that are benefitting from the project. 
 Invasive Species Rangeland Restoration Projects

Two conservation districts around the state and the Bruneau-Owyhee Sage-grouse Habitat, or BOSH, project have tapped into the Sage Grouse Action Team grant funds to restore native rangeland habitat by spraying invasive grasses with herbicide, which allows native grasses and forbs to “release” and grow back following the treatments.   
In the fall of 2021, Connor White, BOSH project manager, worked with two different private landowners to treat a total of 136 acres of land infested with medusahead wild rye, cheatgrass, ventenata and Japanese brome. Both sites were sprayed with the herbicide Rejuvra. 
The rangeland restoration project was done following the treatment for invasive juniper trees. The BOSH project has been removing juniper to open up historic sage grouse habitat areas. The birds are not able to safely use areas where predators like crows, ravens and birds of prey can perch nearby. Juniper trees also consume much of the available water from an area. Once they are removed, native grasses and forbs will increase in vigor, research shows. 
If invasive grasses are preventing the native vegetation from rebounding, rangeland projects are experimenting with the use of the herbicides Rejuvra and Plateau to allow the natives more space, water and nutrients to grow back, White said.
“We did those initial pilot projects and then in the fall of 2023, we treated 3,000 acres in two fields with similar results,” White said. 
More information about the science of using Rejuvra has been coming forth from the research community, he said. Rejuvra can take several years to show positive results, he said. It can be used in tandem with Plateau, which brings stronger results in the first year, White said.
Once the native grasses and forbs have space to thrive, they will release and grow. “My goodness, we were surprised how well things grew back,” he said. 
The Lemhi SWC and Cassia SWCD tried similar treatments to eliminate annual invasive grasses with similar results.

Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
Idaho governor signs bill to privatize management, add work requirements to Medicaid program

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.

6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

(Mario Tama | Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.

(Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas House will consider a proposed amendment to the state’s enjoined social media age verification law after the legislation received Senate approval Monday.
Additionally, the Senate will vote Tuesday on a bill that would create a right for parents to sue social media platforms if their child develops eating disorders, self-harms, commits or attempts suicide, or becomes addicted to the platform’s feeds because of content the child was exposed to.
Sen. Tyler Dees, R-Siloam Springs, and Rep. Jon Eubanks, R-Paris, introduced both bills last week.
Senate Bill 611 would amend Act 689 of 2023, the Social Media Safety Act, which was the first of its kind in the nation and required social media platforms to verify the age of new account holders in Arkansas. Those under 18 could only access sites with parental permission.
A federal judge temporarily blocked Act 689 in August 2023, before it went into effect, and permanently blocked the law March 31 for violating the First Amendment and the due process clause of the U.S. Constitution.
The amendments to Act 689 in SB 611 more clearly define social media and apply the definition to more platforms, lower the age of minor users from under 18 to under 16 years old, prohibit social media algorithms from targeting minors, and add a penalty for companies that do not comply.
“There still is reasonable age-verification language, but it puts more emphasis on the social media company to make sure that they are not preying on the youth,” Dees said.
SB 611 passed the Senate with a bipartisan 21 votes. Four senators voted present and seven did not vote. Sens. Ricky Hill, R-Cabot; Jim Dotson, R-Bentonville; and Stephanie Flowers, D-Pine Bluff, voted against the bill.
Arkansas Legislature passes social media age verification bill over privacy, speech concerns

Hill expressed the same concerns he did in 2023 before he voted against Act 689.
“I know I’m not going to change any of y’all’s minds, but I do want you to think about the slippery slope we’re walking on,” Hill said. “…If you want to limit the freedom of speech, go ahead and continue to vote for this.”
Dees said SB 611 would not result in withholding content but instead would “protect our most vulnerable.”
“We’re trying to make sure that the profits of these social media companies don’t come before the protection of our children,” Dees said.
Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders made the Social Media Safety Act a priority during her first year in office. In January, she called on lawmakers to amend the law and to give parents the right to take legal action against technology companies if their children experience mental health crises, such as suicidal ideation, tied to social media consumption.
No members of the public spoke for or against Senate Bill 612, the private right of action bill, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, which passed the bill with no audible dissent Monday.
Under SB 612, a social media platform could be held accountable for “placing content on the feed, screen, account, or other digital medium of the minor that causes the minor to view the content without explicitly searching for that specific content and includes algorithmic promotion of the content based on a previous search or engagement” if viewing the content leads to “significant bodily or cognitive harm.”
Dees told both the committee and the full Senate that technology companies have contacted him asking for the bills to be amended so it would not be applicable to them. He said he is open to amending the bill but does not want to accommodate billion-dollar companies that have “neglected our youth.”
SB 611 and SB 612 both establish a civil penalty of $10,000 per violation. The penalty for violating the Social Media Safety Act was originally $2,500 per violation.
Sens. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, and Gary Stubblefield, R-Branch, both asked Dees during the committee meeting how a plaintiff would prove under SB 612 that a social media platform “knowingly” caused intangible harm to a minor.

Whether a platform leads a minor to “develop or sustain an addiction” to it, as SB 612 states, is “a little tougher to prove” than a suicide attempt or an eating disorder “without getting inside someone’s head,” Tucker said.
Dees said SB 612 is “the framework to have that discussion” and creates a process for the courts to decide “if there’s damaging aspects that have taken place as a result of an interaction with Big Tech.”
Dees and Eubanks also sponsored the Bell to Bell, No Cell Act, which Sanders signed in February, that bans personal electronic devices, including cell phones and smart watches, in schools.
In March, a bipartisan majority of House members approved two bills that mimic stalled federal legislation aimed at regulating companies’ online interactions with children. Lead sponsor Rep. Zack Gramlich, R-Fort Smith, told the Advocate he does not expect to proceed with one of them, the Arkansas Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA).
The other bill is House Bill 1717, the Arkansas Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act. Gramlich said he is amending the bill and hopes to present it to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.
HB 1717 would ban technology companies from collecting data from Arkansas minors except under specific circumstances, such as for financial transactions. They would also be barred from retaining that data and disclosing it to third parties that use the information in advertising targeted to children.

SILVERTHORNE, Colo. — When Adolfo Román García-Ramírez walks home in the evening from his shift at a grocery store in this central Colorado mountain town, sometimes he thinks back on his childhood in Nicaragua. Adults, he recollects, would scare the kids with tales of the “Mona Bruja,” or “Monkey Witch.” Step too far into the dark, they told him, and you might just get snatched up by the giant monstrous monkey who lives in the shadows.
Now, when García-Ramírez looks over his shoulder, it’s not monster monkeys he is afraid of. It’s U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers.
“There’s this constant fear that you’ll be walking down the street and a vehicle rolls up,” García-Ramírez, 57, said in Spanish. “They tell you, ‘We’re from ICE; you’re arrested,’ or, ‘Show me your papers.’”

Silverthorne, a commuter town between the ski meccas of Breckenridge and Vail, has been García-Ramírez’s home for the past two years. He works as a cashier at the grocery and shares a two-bedroom apartment with four roommates.
The town of nearly 5,000 has proved a welcome haven for the political exile, who was released from prison in 2023 after Nicaragua’s authoritarian government brokered a deal with the U.S. government to transfer more than 200 political prisoners to the U.S. The exiles were offered temporary residency in the U.S. under a Biden administration humanitarian parole program.
García-Ramírez’s two-year humanitarian parole expired in February, just a few weeks after President Donald Trump issued an executive order to end the program that had permitted temporary legal residency in the U.S. for hundreds of thousands of Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans, putting him at risk of deportation. García-Ramírez was stripped of his Nicaraguan citizenship when he came to the U.S. Just over a year ago, he applied for political asylum. He is still waiting for an interview.
“I can’t safely say I’m calm, or I’m OK, right now,” García-Ramírez said. “You feel unsafe, but you also feel incapable of doing anything to make it better.”
Vail and Breckenridge are world famous for their ski slopes, which attract millions of people a year. But life for the tourism labor force that serves Colorado’s mountain resorts is less glamorous. Residents of Colorado’s mountain towns experience high rates of suicide and substance use disorders, fueled in part by seasonal fluctuations in income that can cause stress for many in the local workforce.

The Latino communities who make up significant proportions of year-round populations in Colorado’s mountain towns are particularly vulnerable. A recent poll found more than 4 in 5 Latino respondents in the Western Slope region, home to many of the state’s rural ski resort communities, expressed “extremely or very serious” concern about substance use. That’s significantly higher than in rural eastern Colorado’s Morgan County, which also has a sizable Latino population, and in Denver and Colorado Springs.
Statewide, concerns about mental health have surged among Latinos in recent years, rising from fewer than half calling it an extremely or very serious problem in 2020 to more than three-quarters in 2023. Health care workers, researchers, and community members all say factors such as language differences, cultural stigma, and socioeconomic barriers may exacerbate mental health issues and limit the ability to access care.
“You’re not getting regular medical care. You’re working long hours, which probably means that you can’t take care of your own health,” said Asad Asad, a Stanford University assistant professor of sociology. “All of these factors compound the stresses that we all might experience in daily life.”
Add sky-high costs of living and an inadequate supply of mental health facilities across Colorado’s rural tourist destinations, and the problem becomes acute.
Now, the Trump administration’s threats of immigration raids and imminent deportation of anyone without legal U.S. residency have caused stress levels to soar. In communities around Vail, advocates estimate, a vast majority of Latino residents do not have legal status. Communities near Vail and Breckenridge have not experienced immigration raids, but in neighboring Routt County, home to Steamboat Springs, at least three people with criminal records have been detained by ICE, according to news reports. Social media posts falsely claiming local ICE sightings have further fueled concerns.
Into the shadows
Yirka Díaz Platt, a bilingual social worker in Silverthorne originally from Peru, said a pervasive fear of deportation has caused many Latino workers and residents to retreat into the shadows. People have begun to cancel in-person meetings and avoid applying for government services that require submitting personal data, according to local health workers and advocates. In early February, some locals didn’t show up to work as part of a nationwide “day without immigrants” strike. Employers wonder whether they will lose valuable employees to deportation.
Some immigrants have stopped driving out of fear they will be pulled over by police. Paige Baker-Braxton, director of outpatient behavioral health at the Vail Health system, said she has seen a decline in visits from Spanish-speaking patients over the last few months.
“They’re really trying to keep to themselves. They are not really socializing much. If you go to the grocery stores, you don’t see much of our community out there anymore,” Platt said. “There’s that fear of, ‘No, I’m not trusting anyone right now.’”










If they deport me from here, I’d go directly to Nicaragua ... Honestly, I don’t think I would last even a day.


– Adolfo Román García-Ramírez


Juana Amaya is no stranger to digging in her heels to survive. Amaya immigrated to the Vail area from Honduras in 1983 as a single mother of a 3-year-old and a 6-month-old. She has spent more than 40 years working as a house cleaner in luxury condos and homes around Vail, sometimes working up to 16 hours a day. With barely enough time to finish work and care for a family at home, she said, it is often hard for Latinos in her community to admit when the stress has become too much.
“We don’t like to talk about how we’re feeling,” she said in Spanish, “so we don’t realize that we’re dealing with a mental health problem.”
Support groups
The current political climate has only made things worse.
“It’s had a big impact,” she said. “There are people who have small children and wonder what they’ll do if they’re in school and they are taken away somewhere, but the children stay. What do you do?”
Asad has studied the mental health impacts of deportation rhetoric on Latino communities. He co-authored a study, published last year in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, that found escalated deportation rhetoric may cause heightened levels of psychological distress in Latino noncitizens and even in Latino citizens.
Asad found that both groups may experience increased stress levels, and research has borne out the negative consequences of a parent’s lack of documentation on the health and educational attainment of their children.
“The inequalities or the hardships we impose on their parents today are the hardships or inequalities their children inherit tomorrow,” Asad said.
Despite heightened levels of fear and anxiety, Latinos living and working near Vail still find ways to support one another and seek help. Support groups in Summit County, home to Breckenridge and less than an hour’s drive from Vail, have offered mental health workshops for new immigrants and Latina women. Building Hope Summit County and Olivia’s Fund in Eagle County, home to Vail, help those without insurance pay for a set number of therapy sessions.
Vail Health plans to open a regional inpatient psychiatric facility in May, and the Mobile Intercultural Resource Alliance provides wraparound services, including behavioral health resources, directly to communities near Vail.
Back in Silverthorne, García-Ramírez, the Nicaraguan exile, takes things one day at a time.
“If they deport me from here, I’d go directly to Nicaragua,” said García-Ramírez, who said he had received a verbal death threat from authorities in his native country. “Honestly, I don’t think I would last even a day.”
In the meantime, he continues to make the routine trek home from his cashier job, sometimes navigating slick snow and dark streets past 9 p.m. When nightmarish thoughts about his own fate in America surface, García-Ramírez focuses on the ground beneath his feet.
“Come rain, shine, or snow,” he said, “I walk.”

Debate over a bill to deny certain immigrant children the right to an education was disrupted Monday as two Lutheran pastors knelt in front of a House committee room and recited the Lord’s Prayer. Others in the audience soon joined from their seats. 
The bill (HB793/SB836) by Sen. Bo Watson of Hixson and House Majority Leader William Lamberth of Portland — both Republicans — would give public school districts the option of verifying student immigration status, charging tuition of students who cannot prove they are legal residents or barring enrollment entirely.
Legislative hearings about the bill have often drawn large audiences, including clergy who have previously interrupted debate to recite the Pledge of Allegiance and sung “Jesus Loves the Little Children.” 
‘Economically reckless’ Small businesses slam bill to bar immigrant kids from school

On Monday, as during previous disruptions, Republicans immediately called for a vote as the Christian prayer was recited, then exited the room. The measure passed 8-7. 
A companion bill in the Senate is headed to a floor vote. The two bills differ in one key respect: the Senate version requires schools to check immigration status. In the House version, public school districts have the option of checking status, rather than a legal mandate.
Rep. John Ray Clemmons, a Nashville Democrat, raised his voice and, at times, banged his hand on the dais, speaking out against the measure as a way to “discriminate against innocent children who have no idea whether they are undocumented or not.” 
“I’ve given up trying to compel people with empathy, heart, love, anything like that so I’m going to talk about money,” he said. Clemmons cited data showing the high costs of crime, healthcare, lifetime lowered earning potential and poverty associated with children not finishing high school. 
“All of these things cost the state of Tennessee money. And all are the direct results of kids not finishing high school,” he said. “This makes no sense.”
Lamberth has cited rising cost of English-language learner instruction in Tennessee public schools as one driver of the bill, while critics have noted English language learners include legal immigrants. Lamberth has also made clear that his goal for the legislation is to draw a legal challenge that ultimately lands before the Supreme Court in order to revisit its 1982 decision in Plyler v. Doe, which established the right to public school education for all children, regardless of immigration status.

Lamberth stressed Monday his version of the bill is permissive, giving ultimate authority on whether to check student immigration status, charge tuition or deny enrollment to individual school districts. 
The bill’s language contains no requirement that schools report students without legal status to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, but Watson, the bill’s cosponsor, told lawmakers last week that was “something to be considered in the rules and regulations” the state Department of Education would develop should the bill become law.
Rep. Monty Fritts, a Republican from Kingston, praised Lamberth for bringing the bill, saying there is “no greater act of rebellion in these United States than illegally coming across that border.”

“We’re not talking about immigrants. We’re talking about illegals. There’s a big difference,” he said, drawing jeers from some in the audience. 
Fritts’s comments also drew pushback from TIRRC Votes, the political action arm of the Tennessee Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights.
“Republicans like Rep. Fritts are scrambling to point their finger at immigrants in order to distract us from the real insurrection happening before our eyes,” said Judith Clerjeune, TIRRC Votes advocacy director. “An unelected billionaire is hijacking Tennesseans’ retirement accounts while a lawless president defies court orders and imposes shortsighted tariffs, raising the prices of everything from eggs to cars to homes.
Monday’s meeting drew about a dozen clergy members and pastors from Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, the United Methodist Church, Church of Christ and other denominations who were among more than 240 faith leaders who signed a letter to lawmakers urging them to vote against the bill.
“We are calling on you to consider the impact of your vote and steward the influence you have to create welcoming communities for the neighbors Christ commands us to love as ourselves,” the letter said.
The bill will next be heard in the House Finance committee next week.

Kennedy Jr.’s firing of public records staffers at federal health agencies undercuts his promise to deliver “radical transparency.” (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunita Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”

Tennessee’s Senate passed legislation Monday that would force the state’s private-prison operator to lower the inmate population in facilities with high death rates.
Senators voted 30-0 in favor of Senate Bill 1115 sponsored by Republican Sen. Mark Pody of Lebanon, who wants to renew the legislature’s correction oversight board and take action if the private operator, CoreCivic, can’t bring down death rates. 
The bill would require the inmate population at CoreCivic-run prisons to be reduced by 10% if the death rate there is twice as high as the rate at a comparable state-run prison. It also requires the company to resolve problems causing high death rates.
The House version, HB114, backed by Republican Rep. Clark Boyd of Lebanon isn’t expected to be considered until House members approve a budget, likely within two weeks. Pody said he anticipates no problems getting the House version passed.

Lebanon resident Tim Leeper said after Monday’s vote he believes prison privatization has no benefits, except for CoreCivic shareholders. The Senate vote sends a message that lawmakers aren’t satisfied with private prisons, he added.
“It puts us on record and it puts legislators on record, now we have a problem. If we didn’t have a problem, we wouldn’t have legislation that has proceeded up to this point, unanimously,” said Leeper, whose son died of an overdose at Trousdale Turner prison, one of four the company runs in Tennessee.
State Comptroller audits show Trousdale Turner had a 146% employee turnover rate in 2023, making it more difficult to check on prisoners and avert murders and drug overdoses. Trousdale Turner, which is under a civil rights investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice, has a correction officer vacancy rate of 33.7%, compared with 26% at state-run prisons, officials said earlier this year.
Still, the state is seeking a $6.8 million contract increase for the private prison operator despite penalizing the company $44.78 million since 2022 for contractual shortfalls, $15 million in the last half year. 
CoreCivic, which is paid based on the number of inmates it houses, doesn’t pay those penalties but simply forgoes state payments.
A spokesperson for CoreCivic said in a recent email statement that prisoner safety, health and well-being is “top priority” and that each facility has emergency response teams to handle medical care. All deaths are reported immediately to the state for investigation, he said.
Tennessee Correction Commissioner Frank Strada has called the company an important “partner.”

Jeff Landry’s direction and presented a proposed budget to lawmakers that would effectively keep their state funding at current levels. Lawmakers could choose to deviate from the governor’s proposed budget, but it is unlikely higher education will get a significant boost beyond the proposed funding.  Landry’s budget [&#8230;]","A. O. Williams Hall on the campus of the Southern University Agricultural Research and Extension Center in Baton Rouge. (Photo courtesy Southern University)Louisiana college and university leaders have followed Gov. Jeff Landry’s direction and presented a proposed budget to lawmakers that would effectively keep their state funding at current levels.
Lawmakers could choose to deviate from the governor’s proposed budget, but it is unlikely higher education will get a significant boost beyond the proposed funding. 
Landry’s budget would decrease state funding for higher education by about $68 million, largely the result of one-time expenses from the previous budget cycle. The proposal also acknowledges an increase in tuition and fee revenue, meaning the overall budget for higher education would increase just over $4 million. 
Lawmakers could have had more money to allocate if voters had supported Landry’s proposed Amendment Two in the March 29 election. It would have reworked the state’s tax structure and moved hundreds of millions of dollars in tax revenue from state savings accounts into Louisiana’s general fund, where it could have been more easily spent. 
Landry’s budget plans come amid uncertainty in federal funding for higher education and other state government entities. As President Donald Trump’s administration seeks to shrink government spending, universities are preparing for the possibility of substantially slashed federal research grants. 
Under the proposed budget, the Southern University System, the nation’s only system of Historically Black Colleges and Universities, would see a budget decrease of about $33 million, primarily from decreased tuition and fee revenue as well as a small dip in state appropriations. 
The LSU System would experience a budget increase of about $46 million, driven by a boost in self-generated revenue from record enrollments at its campuses. The University of Louisiana System, which enrolls more students than any other system, would also see a budget increase from raised revenue. Its overall budget would increase about $14 million. 
The Louisiana Community and Technical College System would also see a slight boost of $3 million. 
When the legislature convenes for its annual session next week, lawmakers will consider what changes they will make to the state budget. Both House and Senate members will get a chance to make adjustments. 
In addition to the primary state government operations bill, higher education receives money in the state construction budget and in a supplemental bill that covers a lesser amount of one-time money. Colleges and universities typically receive a substantial chunk of this funding.

Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

This [&#8230;]","Exposure to mixed coal mine dust that contains silica — a carcinogen — can lead to the development of pneumoconiosis, commonly known as black lung disease. (Getty Images)I’ve always thought the bumper sticker “Friends of Coal” was odd. Why be a friend to a fossil fuel? Especially one that’s caused so much disease, death and destruction in the state.
About 20% of coal miners in Central Appalachia are suffering from black lung, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This is the highest rate of black lung detected in more than 25 years. 
Coal miners are also being diagnosed with the disease at younger ages because they have to dig through such large amounts of silica-rich sandstone to reach the coal, West Virginia Watch reporter Caity Coyne reported last summer.
We hear our politicians constantly talking about supporting coal, and how former President Joe Biden hurt coal production. They say they want to stand up for coal. In reality, they’re only standing up for the coal mine owners to have less regulations so they can make more money.
And let’s be honest  — coal mine owners in West Virginia show all the time they don’t care about coal miners.
For more than a decade the U.S. Department of Labor sent out monthly newsletters detailing impact inspections the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) performed at mines with histories of repeated safety and health violations. These reports started after the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster in West Virginia killed 29 miners in April 2010.
Saturday marked the 15 year anniversary of the worst mining disaster in the United States since 1970.
A little background of the Upper Big Branch Mine disaster — MSHA’s final report concluded that 
“Massey’s corporate culture was the root cause of the tragedy.” MSHA issued Massey Energy Co., the owner of the mine, and its subsidiary, Performance Coal Co, 369 citations and orders, including for an “unprecedented 21 flagrant violations, which carry the most serious civil penalties available under the law.”
The former Massey Energy CEO Don Blankenship was convicted of conspiring to violate mine safety and health standards that led to the disaster. He served a year in prison.
The last MSHA newsletter was in January, before President Donald Trump took office. At the top of the final press release, it states, “Please note: As of 01/20/2025, information in some news releases may be out of date or not reflect current policies.”
You’re probably familiar with another man who owns coal mines — West Virginia Sen. Jim Justice.
Justice often said he didn’t want to go to Washington, D.C., and yet, he still ran for a U.S. Senate seat and he won. 
The Justice family owns nearly two dozen coal companies that owe more than $409,000 in delinquent mine safety fines to the federal government. Last month, the companies agreed to pay off that debt by May 1.
If West Virginia’s members of Congress care about coal and coal miners, then explain why not a single member of the state’s delegation is backing the Robert C. Byrd Mine Safety Protection Act that was introduced Thursday by Sen. Tim Kaine and Rep. Bobby Scott, who both represent Virginia.
Sens. Justice and Shelley Moore Capito, and Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore, why are you not on this bill — named for our former senator — that aims to help coal miners?
“Miners take incredible risks to power our nation. While we’ve made progress to support them — like extending the Black Lung Disability Trust excise tax at a higher rate and strengthening silica standards — the recent actions of the Trump Administration have undermined decades of work to enhance protections for coal miners,” Kaine said in a press release. “This legislation is critical to strengthening safety standards and holding mine operators accountable for unsafe working conditions.”
To be clear: While our leaders have remained silent, the health and safety of our coal miners is under direct threat at this very moment and right under their noses.
Just last week, a federal appeals court issued a temporary stay on the implementation of what advocates have called a long overdue industry rule that would have limited how much dangerous silica dust coal miners are exposed to while they work. The rule — which simply adds the same exposure limits to the mining industry that have existed in other industries for years through the Occupational Safety and Health Administration — was set to go into effect for coal mines next week.
Officials said last year that the rule would have likely saved thousands of lives by limiting exposure to silica dust, which is the leading cause of black lung disease. But with the decision from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, the final fate of the rule remains unknown.
The Trump administration is closing 33 MSHA field offices. According to the Appalachian Citizens Law Center, these closures could significantly reduce the number of staff and inspections meant to prevent exposure to toxic dust, mining injuries and fatalities, and mining disasters.
“Closing these offices will, at a minimum, dramatically limit the ability for inspectors todo their job in a timely way by greatly expanding the territory they must cover from remaining offices,” according to the Appalachian Citizens Law Center. “At worst, staff and inspection numbers could be sharply reduced.”
The Department of Government Efficiency also eliminated hundreds of employees at Morgantown’s National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. The office is expected to close completely, according to Cathy Tinney-Zara, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 3040.
NIOSH focuses on black lung research and screening.
“It’s devastating. People will die,” said Tinney-Zara. “There is no one else in the government that does occupational safety and health. There’s no one else in the U.S. We’re the only group, NIOSH, that does occupational safety and health. We do the research to make everyone’s job safer.”
To her credit, Capito did say she has “strong disagreements” with the Trump administration’s approach to cutting federal employees in West Virginia, and told reporters that she’d be talking to Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. about the NIOSH layoffs.
It’s about time Capito grew a backbone. Senator, please show the rest of your delegation how to stand up to Trump when he’s hurting your constituents. 
It’s time for our elected leaders to be friends of coal miners instead of “Friends of Coal.”

But after just four months behind bars, John Estin Davis walked free. President Donald Trump commuted Davis’ sentence in the last days of his first term. In a statement explaining the decision, the White House said that “no one suffered financially” from Davis’ crime.
In court, however, the Trump administration was saying something very different. As the president let him go, the Department of Justice alleged in a civil lawsuit that Davis and his company defrauded taxpayers out of tens of millions of dollars with excessive urine drug testing. The DOJ alleged that Comprehensive Pain Specialists made such a “staggering” sum from cups of pee that employees had given the testing a profit-minded nickname: “liquid gold.”
Davis and the company denied all allegations in court filings and settled the DOJ’s fraud lawsuit without any determination of liability. Davis declined to comment for this article.

Since returning to the White House, Trump has said he will target fraud in Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, and his Republican allies in Congress have made combating fraud a key argument in their plans to slash spending on Medicaid, which provides health care for millions of low-income and disabled Americans. During an address to Congress last month, Trump said his administration had found “hundreds of billions of dollars of fraud” without citing any specific examples of fraud.
“Taken back a lot of that money,” Trump said. “We got it just in time.”
But Trump’s history of showing leniency to convicted fraudsters contrasts with his present-day crackdown. In his first and second terms, Trump has granted pardons or commutations to at least 68 people convicted of fraud crimes or of interfering with fraud investigations, according to a KFF Health News review of court and clemency records, DOJ press releases, and news reports. At least 13 of those fraudsters were convicted in cases involving more than $1.6 billion of fraudulent claims filed with Medicare and Medicaid, according to the Department of Justice.
And as one of the first actions of his second term, Trump fired 17 independent inspectors general responsible for rooting out fraud and waste in government.
“It sends a really bad message and really hurts DOJ efforts at creating deterrence,” said Jacob Elberg, a former assistant U.S. attorney and law professor at Seton Hall University in New Jersey. “In order to reduce health care fraud, you need people both to be afraid of getting in trouble, but also for people to believe in the legitimacy of the system.”
Elberg said considerable fraud in Medicare and Medicaid exists largely because the programs’ “pay-and-chase models” prioritize paying for patient care first and tracking down stolen dollars second. To prevent more fraud, the programs would likely need to be redesigned in ways that would be slower and more cumbersome for all patients, Elberg said.
Regardless, Elberg said the president’s claimed focus on fraud appears to be a pretext for slashing spending that has been legally appropriated by Congress. Trump has empowered the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency, which he established and named by executive order, to make deep cuts in federal budgets, halting some medical research and aid programs in addition to cutting spending on climate change, transgender health, and diversity, equity, and inclusion programs.
“What’s been the focal point to date of the administration is not what anybody has ever referred to as health care fraud,” Elberg said. “There is a real blurring — a seemingly intentional blurring — between what is actually fraud and what is just spending that they are not in favor of.”
Jerry Martin, who served as a U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee under President Barack Obama and now represents health care fraud whistleblowers, also said Trump’s focus on fraud appeared to be “just a platform to attack things that they don’t agree with” rather than “a genuine desire to root out and combat fraud.”
Even so, Martin said some of his whistleblower clients have been emboldened.
“I’ve had clients repeat back to me ‘President Trump says fraud is a priority,’” Martin said. “People are listening to it. But I don’t know that what he’s saying translates into what they believe.”
The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this article.
A billion-dollar fraud case and needless eye injections
Presidents enjoy the unique authority to erase federal convictions and prison sentences with pardons and commutations. In theory, the power is intended to be a final bulwark against injustice or overly harsh punishment. But many presidents have been accused of using the pardon power to reward powerful allies and close associates as they leave the White House.
Trump issued about 190 pardons and commutations in the final two months of his first term, including for some health care fraudsters convicted of schemes with astonishing costs.
For example, Trump granted a commutation to Philip Esformes, a Florida health care executive convicted in 2019 of a $1.3 billion Medicare and Medicaid fraud scheme. After he was sentenced, DOJ announced in a press release that “the man behind one of the biggest health care frauds in history will be spending 20 years in prison.” Trump freed him 14 months later.
Trump also granted a commutation to Salomon Melgen, a Florida eye doctor who was serving a 17-year prison sentence for defrauding Medicare of $42 million. Melgen falsely diagnosed patients with eye diseases, then gave them unnecessary care, including laser treatments and painful eye injections, according to DOJ and court documents.
“Salomon Melgen callously took advantage of patients who came to him fearing blindness,” said a DOJ news release after Melgen was sentenced in 2018. “They received medically unreasonable and unnecessary tests and procedures that victimized his patients and the American taxpayer.”
DOJ: $70 million spent on ‘excessive’ urine testing
Despite the flurry of pardons and commutations at the end of Trump’s first term, the leniency he showed Davis was unique. Davis was the only convicted health care fraudster to receive clemency while the Trump administration was simultaneously accusing him of more fraud.
As CEO of Comprehensive Pain Specialists from 2011 to 2017, Davis oversaw a rapid expansion to more than 60 locations across 12 states, according to federal court documents.
He was indicted in 2018 for using his CEO position to refer Medicare patients in need of medical equipment to a conspirator in return for kickbacks paid through a shell company, according to court documents. He was convicted at trial in April 2019 of defrauding Medicare.
Three months later, the DOJ filed a fraud lawsuit against Davis and CPS that piggybacked on the claims of seven whistleblowers. The lawsuit alleged that CPS collected more than $70 million from federal insurance programs for urine drug testing, most of which was “excessive,” and that an audit of a sampling of the tests had found at least 93% “lacked medical necessity.”

The Department of Justice has alleged in a fraud lawsuit that samples like this one were tested excessively, sometimes up to 51 times. CPS denied all allegations and settled the lawsuit without admitting any liability.(Photo by Heidi de Marco/KFF Health News)
Typically, government insurance programs pay for urine testing so pain clinics can verify that patients are taking their prescriptions properly and not abusing any other drugs, which could contribute to an overdose. Patients could be tested as little as once a year or as often as monthly depending on their level of risk, according to the DOJ lawsuit.
But Comprehensive Pain Specialists performed “myriad urine drug testing on virtually every CPS patient on virtually every visit” then conducted “at least 16 different types of tests” on each sample, and sometimes as many as 51, according to the lawsuit.
Trump commuted Davis’ sentence for his criminal conviction in January 2021 as the DOJ was finalizing a settlement in the civil lawsuit. The commutation was supported by country music star Luke Bryan, according to a White House statement.
Months later, with President Joe Biden in office, CPS and its owners agreed to repay $4.1 million — less than 10% of the damages sought in the suit — and the case was closed.
In the settlement, Davis agreed not to take any job where he would ever again bill Medicare or other federal health care programs. He was not required to personally repay anything.
Martin, who represented one of the whistleblowers who first raised allegations against Davis and CPS, said the leniency that Trump showed to him and other health care fraudsters may discourage DOJ employees from pursuing similar investigations during his second term.
“There are a lot of rank-and-file people who are operating at the lowest point in their professional careers, where they’ve seen a lot of their work essentially be water under the bridge,” Martin said. “That’s got to be really demoralizing.”

Sears/Maryland Matters)The governor was disappointed, some of the biggest bills got put off to the last day, last-minute wrangling doomed some bills and saved some others, and it all ended at midnight with balloons and confetti raining down from the galleries to mark the end of 90 days of work.
In other words, just another Sine Die.
It was a final day that proceeded at the usual hectic pace but with little of the usual drama. When lawmakers convened on Jan. 8, the big issues were the state’s budget utility reform and possible changes to the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s sweeping education reform plan. When they adjourned Monday, those issues were still hanging around but passed with little fuss beyond Republican carping.
Scores of low-profile bills were pushed across the finish line, while scores more quietly died. Some of the biggest attention went toward some of the least-consequential bills, to make chromite the official state mineral and to make orange crush the official state cocktail.
And while adjourning “sine die” — literally, without day — means eight to nine months of peace, lawmakers could find themselves back in Annapolis in a matter of months coping with the impact of federal cuts on the state budget they just spent three months crafting.
Here, in no particular order, are the moments and the measures that made for Sine Die 2025.
Moore’s not mad , just disappointed
Balloons and confetti had barely settled on the floors of the House and Senate when Gov. Wes Moore (D) let it be known that he did not get everything he had hoped for this year, after two years of bragging about going “10 for 10” on his legislative agenda.
In a statement posted at 12:06 a.m., Moore praised efforts to reform the state tax code — an effort that looked very different from the one he proposed — and the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future (which the House remade in its image). But he pointed out that the Democratic majority just did not do enough.
“We also introduced legislation centered on addressing the issues that Marylanders tell me they care about the most — from housing to small business growth to energy rates,” Moore said in his statement. “Yet, the General Assembly did not pass our bill that confronted, head-on, the challenge of producing more affordable housing in our state. The General Assembly also missed an opportunity to make Maryland a more attractive destination for businesses. And the General Assembly failed to make nuclear energy a core part of the state’s clean energy strategy, so we could add more capacity to Maryland’s energy portfolio.”

The governor skipped the final-day visits to the House and Senate that he made in his first two years in office. In a mid-afternoon meeting with reporters, he gave no hint of his sour view of the General Assembly’s performance, saying instead that his administration focused on building strong relationships with lawmakers.
“I don’t think there’s anyone who could argue that this is the administration that doesn’t just believe in coalition building, but the way that we coalition-build, in comparison to what has happened before in the state of Maryland, that it’s been a night and day shift,” Moore told reporters Monday afternoon.
It remains to be seen how Moore will address his concerns. In recent weeks, he has hinted at the potential of using his veto pen. On Monday night, Moore repeated those nonspecific warnings.
“I wanted to make sure that we were making Maryland more economically competitive, making us more business friendly, and continue the trend that we’re seeing when new business starts,” Moore told reporters. “I was not going to deal with other things that I felt contradicted that, and we had to make sure we are investing in our people, and so that is going to be the lens that I started the session with.”
And, he said, that would be the lens through which he viewed each bill sent to him.
“If things violate or do not make sense with that in the context of what’s happening right now, especially what’s happened with the federal government, it will not get my signature,” Moore said.
Finally, medical parole done
It was never certain, but after several years of trying, lawmakers were able to push through reforms to the state’s parole system Monday for incarcerated individuals who are ill or aging.
Passage came after the House and Senate agreed to changes that make House Bill 1123, sponsored by Del. J. Sandy Bartlett (D-Anne Arundel), and Senate Bill 181, sponsored by Sen Shelly Hettleman (D-Baltimore County), sync.
The amendments that would reform the medical and geriatric parole process include raising the age from 60 to 65 for incarcerated individuals to seek parole, and increasing the time served from minimum of 15 years to a minimum of 20. The final version of the bills also added a five-year pause between petitions for parole from those incarcerated. Minor technical amendments included changing the title from “medical and elder” to “medical and geriatric.”

“Sen. Shelly Hettleman deserves so many props on this. I just came in and carried the football,” said Bartlett, who served as the lead sponsor on this measure for the past two years. “This is going to help so many people.”
This was the fourth year Hettleman worked on legislation to reform the medical and geriatric parole process. She said the legislation could help hundreds of people.
“These are people really ill and people who are much older, who have served their time,” she said. “I do think it will make substantial, important reforms that are long overdue.”
The bills, if signed by the governor, would take effect Oct. 1.
Couldn’t put housing together again
The bill formerly known as the governor’s Housing for Jobs Act was amended to unrecognizability. But despite efforts from lawmakers, county officials and other interested parties to build a bill that would help expedite housing development in certain areas without stepping over local zoning authority, those challenges could not be surmounted before the clock struck midnithg Monday.
Upon introduction in January, House Bill 503 was framed as an expansion of Moore’s housing package from last year. The original version aimed to expedite housing development by requiring counties to automatically approve most qualifying housig project requests in areas where the state determined there was an imbalance between housing and jobs.
The House stripped that bill in its entirety and replaced it with all new language that would have prompted the Department of Housing and Community Development to set 10-year housing targets for the state, its counties and every municipality, and report on their progress annually.
But the House and Senate appeared to disagree on language that would have granted “vesting rights” so that a housing developer with an approved project proposal would retain the right to develop the property. The bill got stuck in the Senate Education, Energy and the Environment Committee, where it stayed until time ran out, killing the bill for session.
‘Chaos’ at House Democrats press gaggle
What if House Democrats held a meeting with reporters and Republicans showed up?
It’s no longer a hypothetical question: It’s just what happened in the waning hours of the 2025 session when House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) and House Majority Whip Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) met with reporters outside a State House press room to talk about the 90-day legislative season.
During that conversation, Moon and Lewis were asked about criticisms leveled by Republicans that conservative voices were being minimized and cut off during debates by House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County).

“I actually think it’s a mischaracterization to say that there’s been complaints from the Republicans about this,” Moon said. “I think there’s been complaints on the floor from the same very small handful of Republicans in the Maryland House that are specifically attempting to emulate their chaos-making friends down on Capitol Hill.”
Moon’s comments were a reference to the Freedom Caucus, a hard-right subgroup of congressional Republicans, that some have dubbed the “Chaos Caucus.” The moniker was adopted by some in Annapolis — a pejorative to describe the seven-member Republican House faction that was officially recognized earlier this year as the state-level version of the Freedom Caucus.
As if on cue, Del. Kathy Szeliga (R-Baltimore County), vice chair of the House Freedom Caucus, arrived and staked out a position in a doorway near Lewis and Moon. Soon, three other members of the newly formed subgroup of the House Republican Caucus arrived and listened from a stairwell.
And when Lewis and Moon left, the Freedom Caucus swooped in to the cameras and microphones. Szeliga, with Dels. Matt Morgan (R-St. Mary’s), Mark N. Fisher (R-Calvert) and Brian Chisholm (R-Anne Arundel), used the opportunity to offer their views on the session.
“This is Maryland’s largest tax increase we’ve ever had in our state’s history,” Morgan, the caucus chair, said of the budget lawmakers passed earlier in the day. “Neighboring states are not in that position. These are Maryland’s policies coming home to roost.”
Members went on to offer opposing views on a number of other policies.
“We have the highest energy prices in the entire region. Did Annapolis Democrats solve that problem? No, they didn’t,” Fisher told reporters. “Did they solve the problem of making Maryland more business friendly? Did Gov. Moore’s policies get through to make Maryland more business friendly? No, they didn’t.”
Members of the caucus spoke to reporters for nearly 10 minutes. And apparently reporters do not have to wait for the next State House mash-up press conference.
“When we started this at the beginning of the session, we said we want to help you guys,” Morgan told reporters. “We want a good relationship and reboot our relationship with the media.”

Nuking the nuclear bill
A bill from the governor (House Bill 505) that would have allowed nuclear energy to count toward the state’s clean energy goals also failed to pass both chambers before midnight, after passing the House of Delegates in April.

Lawmakers stripped the bill for parts, however, adding provisions procuring new nuclear energy for Maryland into the larger Next Generation Energy Act, sponsored by House and Senate leadership. As amended, the bill would have raised the state’s renewable energy targets, but allowed nuclear to fulfill the goals.
In a statement Monday night, Moore bemoaned that the “General Assembly failed to make nuclear energy a core part of the state’s clean energy strategy, so we could add more capacity to Maryland’s energy portfolio.”
Prescription Drug Affordability Board expansion to governor
House Bill 424 and Senate Bill 357, which would expand the authority of a state board to lower prescription drug costs, is now officially on the way to the governor’s desk for his consideration. The board current has authority to look for ways to reduce the cost of certain drugs for people on the state’s health care plan, but the two bills would grant the board authority to place cost reduction efforts on purchasers for private insurance plans.
FAMLI delayed — again
The Senate gave final approval to another delay in the implementation of statewide a paid family and medical leave benefit for another 18 months. The program had been slated to start in July, after being delayed twice already.
House Bill 102 passed the Senate 42-5, pushing off the start date for the Family and Medical Leave Insurance (FAMLI) program. Under the bill, benefits would not be available until 2028.
It’s been marked as one of the “tough decisions” the Moore administration had to make as the state grappled with a budget deficit and with the “uncertainty” and “instability” of federal policies, according to Maryland Department of Labor officials.
Recent polling suggests that more Marylanders would like to see the program go through on its original timeline, but with both chambers approving the measure, the governor will likely approve the delay his administration suggested.
GED English and Spanish
Maryland can now join the rest of the nation in allowing individuals take the General Educational Development test, also known as the GED, in English or Spanish.

House Bill 325 was sponsored by Del. Greg Wims (D-Montgomery), who said Maryland was the only state that did not offer the test in both languages. His bill received approval Thursday after the House concurred with a Senate amendment to have the bill go into effect July 1.
Senate Bill 451 sponsored by Sen. Nancy King (D-Montgomery) garnered approval Monday evening after the Senate unanimously accepted two technical amendments offered by the House Ways and Means Committee. The one sentence in the bill now reads: “Allow an individual to choose to take all components of the examination in either English or Spanish.”
The state Labor Department, which administers GED tests, said 9,131 people whose primary language was Spanish enrolled in programs it offered in 2023-24. Of those individuals, 4,177, or 46%, did not have a high school diploma.
“This is one of the most important bills of the session,” Wims said after the House adjourned Sine Die early Tuesday morning. “In my district, we have newcomers and immigrants. A lot of them, English is a second language, but they’re hard workers. This will help thousands of young people over the next decade or so.”
The 1980s want its legislature back
As the hour grew late on Sine Die, things devolved in the House of Delegates. All the way back to the 1980s, that is.
The episode began when Del. Lauren Arikan (R-Harford) rose to challenge Senate Bill 930, which allows local governments, as a pilot program, to purify their wastewater effluent and inject it into the groundwater aquifer to bolster water supply.
Arikan called the bill “nasty” and labeled it “crazy town.” Then Del. Matt Morgan (R-St. Mary’s) asked House Environment and Transportation Committee Chair Del. Marc Korman (D- Montgomery): “Do you have any concerns about this at all?”
“If I had concerns, I’d have to get in my DeLorean, because this bill — the House version — is already on the governor’s desk,” Korman said, referring to car that was a key part of the 1985 hit film “Back to the Future.”
Then Del. Robin Grammer (R-Baltimore County) piped up: “What’s a DeLorean?” he said, as laughter broke out in the chamber.
“All I know is: When it gets to 88 miles per hour, you’re going to see some serious stuff,” Korman replied.
A few minutes later, Del. Tom Hutchinson (R-Middle Shore) kept the joke going, declaring with a grin that his amendment number was “867-5309,” referring to the 1981 song from Tommy Tutone.
Later on, Hutchinson had to change his vote on the bill (Senate Bill 979).
“I think Jenny confused me,” he said.
Chromite carries crushes to state symbol list
Chromite joins two dozen other official symbols of the state as the official state mineral.
Passage of the bill was an 8-year effort for 18-year-old David Shore. Shore’s irrepressible enthusiasm landed him bill sponsors and a pro bono lobbyist. Eight short years later, he got his bill.

“I’m glad chromite finally got the recognition it deserves as a key part of Maryland’s history, and I am grateful to Senator Zucker and Delegate Korman for seeing the bill through despite a long and rocky road,” Shore said. “The endeavor had fresh youth support this time around, and I hope the success of the chromite bill will inspire other Maryland kids to bring their ideas to the State House.”
The House and Senate last month unanimously passed identical bills designating the mineral, first discovered in Baltimore County in 1808, as the state mineral. More than two dozen states have an official mineral. Only Maryland has bestowed such a designation on chromite.
The official list of state symbols includes a state sport and team sport, dinosaur, dog and cat, and crustacean, among others.
The last state symbol added was rye whiskey in 2023. It was the first time in 15 years that a new state symbol made the list. In 2008, the legislature approved an official state exercise (walking) and official dessert (Smith Island cake).
In the waning hours, the House bootstrapped another state symbol into the Senate version of the chromite bill. The amendment designated the Orange Crush as the official state cocktail. The cocktail bill was headed toward defeat before its legislative resurrection as an amendment.
The governor now has the option of signing the clean version of the House chromite bill or the amended Senate version, with the cocktail. He could also sign or veto both. Neither bill is expected to land in front of Moore when he signs the first batch of bills Tuesday morning.
Two other proposals, one designating the persimmon as the official state fruit, and another that would name the Purple Pitcherplant the state’s carnivorous plant, died in committees.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0046-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 06:04:36.342856

(Getty Images)When presidents try to make big changes through executive orders, they often hit a roadblock: A single federal judge, whether located in Seattle or Miami or anywhere in between, can stop these policies across the entire country.
These court orders have increasingly become a political battleground, increasingly sought by both Republicans and Democrats to fight presidential policies they oppose.
This explains why the Trump administration recently asked the Supreme Court to limit judges’ power to issue what legal experts call “nationwide preliminary injunctions.” Congress also held hearings on curtailing judges’ ability to issue the injunctions.
But what exactly are these injunctions, and why do they matter to everyday Americans?
 Immediate, irreparable harm

When the government creates a policy that might violate the Constitution or federal law, affected people can sue in federal court to stop it. While these lawsuits work their way through the courts – a process that often takes years – judges can issue what are called “preliminary injunctions” to temporarily pause the policy if they determine it might cause immediate, irreparable harm.
A “nationwide” injunction – sometimes called a “universal” injunction – goes further by stopping the policy for everyone across the country, not just for the people who filed the lawsuit.
Importantly, these injunctions are designed to be temporary. They merely preserve the status quo until courts can fully examine the case’s merits. But in practice, litigation proceeds so slowly that executive actions blocked by the courts often expire when successor administrations abandon the policies.

 More executive orders, more injunctions

Nationwide injunctions aren’t new, but several things have made them more contentious recently.
First, since a closely divided and polarized Congress rarely passes major legislation anymore, presidents rely more on executive orders to get substantive things done. This creates more opportunities to challenge presidential actions in court.
Second, lawyers who want to challenge these orders have gotten better at “judge shopping” – filing cases in districts where they’re likely to get judges who agree with their client’s views.
Third, with growing political division, both parties aim to use these injunctions more aggressively whenever the other party controls the White House.
 Affecting real people

These legal fights have tangible consequences for millions of Americans.
Take DACA, the common name for the program formally called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects about 500,000 young immigrants from deportation. For more than 10 years, these young immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” have faced constant uncertainty.
That’s because, when President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 and sought to expand it via executive order in 2015, a Texas judge blocked the expansion with a nationwide injunction. When Trump tried to end DACA, judges in California, New York and Washington, D.C. blocked that move. The program, and the legal challenges to it, continued under President Joe Biden. Now, the second Trump administration faces continued legal challenges over the constitutionality of the DACA program.
More recently, judges have used nationwide injunctions to block several Donald Trump policies. Three different courts stopped the president’s attempt to deny citizenship to babies born to mothers who lack legal permanent residency in the United States. Judges have also temporarily blocked Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military and to freeze some federal funding for a variety of programs.
While much of the current debate focuses on presidential policies, nationwide injunctions have also blocked congressional legislation.
The Corporate Transparency Act, passed in 2021 and originally scheduled to go into effect in 2024, combats financial crimes by requiring businesses to disclose their true owners to the government. A Texas judge blocked this law in 2024 after gun stores challenged it.
In early 2025, the Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect, but the Trump administration announced it simply wouldn’t enforce it – showing how these legal battles can become political power struggles.
 Too much power or necessary protection?

Some critics say nationwide injunctions give too much power to a single judge. If lawyers can pick which judges hear their cases, this raises serious questions about fairness.
Supporters argue that these injunctions protect important rights. For example, without nationwide injunctions in the citizenship cases, babies born to mothers without legal permanent residency would be American citizens in some states but not others – an impossible situation.
Congress is considering legislation to limit judges’ ability to grant nationwide injunctions.
The Trump administration has also tried to make it expensive and difficult to challenge its policies in court. In March 2025, Trump ordered government lawyers to demand large cash deposits – called “security bonds” – from anyone seeking an injunction. Though these bonds are already part of existing court rules, judges usually set them at just a few hundred dollars or waive them entirely when people raise constitutional concerns.
Under the new policy, critics worry that “plaintiffs who sue the government could be forced to put up enormous sums of money in order to proceed with their cases.”
Another way to address the concerns about a single judge blocking government action would be to require a three-judge panel to hear cases involving nationwide injunctions, requiring at least two of them to agree. This is similar to how courts handled major civil rights cases in the 1950s and 1960s.
My research on this topic suggests that three judges working together would be less likely to make partisan decisions, while still being able to protect constitutional rights when necessary. Today’s technology also makes it easier for judges in different locations to work together than it was decades ago.
As the Supreme Court weighs in on this debate, the outcome will affect how presidents can implement policies and how much power individual judges have to stop them. Though it might seem like a technical legal issue, it will shape how government works for years to come – as well as the lives of those who live in the U.S.

Original publication - Illustrated London News - The Ejectment Of Irish Tenantry - pub. 16th December 1848  (Photo by Illustrated London News /Hulton Archive/Getty Images)North Carolina Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation that would impose work requirements on people enrolled in the Medicaid health insurance program.
It’s not a new idea.
As NC Newsline’s Lynn Bonner reported last week, North Carolina’s hard won 2023 Medicaid expansion law already includes a provision requiring the state Department of Health and Human Services to pursue work requirements — that is, to condition eligibility for benefits on enrollees having a job — if it can secure federal approval for such a plan. The Biden administration rejected this idea, but it’s expected that a federal HHS department under Trump would approve it (if, that is, there’s anyone left at the department after recent mass firings to review such a proposal).
But, of course, the idea of conditioning public assistance programs on a demonstration of “worthiness” by those in need goes back a lot further than 2023. Affluent people in positions of power – many of whom inherited their wealth and almost all of whom benefit greatly from tax breaks and subsidies designed to protect it — have long employed such a strategy to restrict aid programs.
Indeed, as author Padraic X. Scanlan documents in a powerful new book, one of the seminal examples in western history took place way back in the mid-19th Century. Scanlan’s book is entitled “Rot: An Imperial History of the Irish Famine,” and in it he details a series of terrible events and policy decisions that led to one of the great human disasters of recent centuries.
The Potato Famine – a calamity also often referred to as “The Great Hunger” – is an event of which many Americans (nearly 10% of whom claim some Irish ancestry) still have a general awareness. The massive blight affecting the main crop that sustained Irish peasants caused as many as two million people to die of starvation and disease or flee the tiny country – many of whom ended up migrating to the U.S. The carnage was so massive that the Irish population today has still yet to recover to the level it was at prior to the famine.
What most people have much less familiarity with, however, are the circumstances that turned a series of crop failures into a massive human catastrophe.
As Scanlan details (and journalist Fintan O’Toole neatly summarizes in a recent essay in The New Yorker entitled, “What made the Irish famine so deadly”), one of the chief contributors to the famine was the refusal of the British politicians and landowners who ruled Ireland to distribute relief because they thought it would violate rules of the free market and indulge the peasants.
Convinced that dispensing free food to starving people would make them slothful, British leaders instead established a kind of “workfare” program in which hungry people were forced to work – at below market wages – in hopes of staying alive.
O’Toole’s essay summarizes the situation this way:

        “The result was the grotesque spectacle of people increasingly debilitated by starvation and disease doing hard physical labor for wages that were not sufficient to keep their families alive. Meanwhile, many of the same people were evicted from their houses as landowners used the crisis to clear off these human encumbrances and free their fields for more profitable pasturage. Exposure joined hunger and sickness to complete the task of mass killing.”    
 
If this sounds familiar, it should, because the premise for Medicaid work requirements – that providing access to health care to people not gainfully employed enriches the undeserving and encourages harmful sloth and dependence — is precisely the same.
Of course, one of the ironies of the recent action in Raleigh is that the sponsors of Medicaid work requirements are, among Republicans anyway, the liberals in this discussion.
GOP state Rep. Donny Lambeth, a Forsyth County Republican who long championed Medicaid expansion and helped convince his GOP colleagues to accept it a decade after it became an option, has rightfully stated that plans under consideration among congressional Republicans to gut Medicaid with hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts would be “a disaster.” He’s actually pitching the enactment of work requirements as, in effect, a kind of human sacrifice to hard right politicians bent on vastly more devastating cuts to the program.
It’s a remarkable state of affairs. Like their pompous predecessors in the bygone British Empire, Republican leaders who control the federal government and the North Carolina legislature are callously and offensively debating two options for how best to deal with low-income people at risk of dying if they lose their health insurance: a) making them work or do community service to keep getting it, or b) simply cutting them loose altogether.
Talk about history repeating itself.
As O’Toole notes, “Above all, ‘Rot’ reminds us that the Great Hunger was a very modern event, and one shaped by a mind-set that is now again in the ascendant,” even if, as he adds ruefully, the chance of other countries taking in millions of starving migrants probably can’t happen today.
As he and Scanlan might have also added, Medicaid work requirements won’t kill as many people as the 19th Century pro-starvation policies of the British in Ireland, but many undoubtedly will die prematurely and the maddening arrogance of the policy makers in the two situations is essentially indistinguishable.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Potato-famine-Getty.jpg,,,2025-04-08 06:04:36.342856

(Bruce DePuyt/ Maryland Matters),"Midday traffic on the American Legion Bridge on June 14, 2022. (Bruce DePuyt/ Maryland Matters)The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) wants to hear citizens’ ideas on how it may update its rules to cut costs and boost efficiency while keeping the country’s transportation system safe. But some Virginia lawmakers caution that those recommendations should come from safety experts, not the public, and say “arbitrarily” loosening roadway regulations could be harmful to supply chains and the economy.
DOT’s request for information is one way the agency is complying with two executive orders signed by President Donald Trump aimed at maximizing effectiveness and reducing regulations. 
According to the request, DOT is seeking public feedback on existing regulations, guidance, paperwork requirements, and other regulatory obligations to assist the agency in identifying how its rules can be modified or repealed without breaking any laws.
As part of this effort, DOT must identify and report to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on regulations in one or more specific areas. This includes regulations that “are based on unlawful delegations of legislative power” and “that raise serious constitutional difficulties,” as well as ones that impose significant costs on companies and businesses without providing benefits to the public that justify these costs. The agency did not provide examples of current regulations that match these descriptions.
It is unclear exactly how individual states’ transportation systems are involved in this effort. 
Marshall Herman, director of communications for the Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT), said in a statement to the Mercury that the department is aware of the DOT’s request. She said the collection and reviews of information that might be relevant to the request are currently underway.
Comments and information, with the identification of “Regulatory Reform RFI,” are due by May 5 and can be submitted through the Federal eRulemaking Portal, by email to transportation.regulatoryinfo@dot.gov with the subject line “Regulatory Reform RFI,” or by mail to U.S. Department of Transportation, Office of the General Counsel, 1200 New Jersey Ave. SE, Washington, DC 20590.
The agency offered a list of 12 questions to help guide commenters in completing its request. 
One of the dozen questions reads: “Are there regulations, guidance, or reporting requirements that have become outdated, and if so, how can they be modernized to better accomplish their objectives?”
Another question asks, “​​Does DOT currently collect information that it does not need or use effectively?”
Virginia House of Delegates Transportation Committee Chair Karrie Delaney, D-Fairfax, said her office is monitoring the agency’s proposal, but is “troubled” by the administration’s approach to regulation reform.
“There’s definitely room to reconsider rules that get in the way of timely completion of critical infrastructure, but those proposals should come from safety experts, not solicited through an online submission form,” Delaney said. 
Besides the safety concerns for drivers and pedestrians, Delaney said “arbitrarily deregulating our roadways will also burden our supply chain and economy beyond the damage we are beginning to see from this administration to trade.”
She said she hopes the White House will work with Congress to make any changes through the “regular process” in order to “properly weigh all considerations” of changing certain rules.



DOT will be required to identify and report to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs on regulations in one or more of the following categories:
– Unconstitutional regulations and regulations that raise serious constitutional difficulties, such as exceeding the scope of the power vested in the Federal Government by the Constitution;
– Regulations that are based on unlawful delegations of legislative power;
– Regulations that are based on anything other than the best reading of the underlying statutory authority or prohibition;
– Regulations that implicate matters of social, political, or economic significance that are not authorized by clear statutory authority;
– Regulations that impose significant costs upon private parties that are not outweighed by public benefits;
– Regulations that harm the national interest by significantly and unjustifiably impeding technological innovation, infrastructure development, disaster response, inflation reduction, research and development, economic development, energy production, land use, and foreign policy objectives
– Regulations that impose undue burdens on small businesses and impede private enterprise and entrepreneurship.

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury) The 2025 election season in Virginia is officially underway — and the landscape is coming into sharp focus after last week’s filing deadline for the June 17 primaries. With the top of the tickets now set and the full list of candidates for the House of Delegates finalized, both parties are preparing for what could be one of the most consequential election years in the commonwealth’s recent history.
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears became the Republican nominee for governor by default after former state Sen. Amanda Chase and former Del. Dave LaRock failed to submit enough valid signatures to qualify for the primary ballot. 
The GOP now avoids a potentially divisive nomination fight and can direct all of its resources toward the general election, where Earle-Sears will face former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee who left Congress in 2024 to run for governor.
Spanberger enters the race with a clear financial advantage. Her campaign reported raising $9.6 million by the end of 2024, with $6.6 million in cash on hand. On Monday, her team announced an additional $6.7 million raised in the first quarter of 2025.
“Our campaign is tremendously grateful for this record-breaking show of support,” Campaign Manager Samson Signori said in an email. “We are proud to run a grassroots campaign with the strong support of thousands of volunteers across every corner of our commonwealth.”
Earle-Sears ended 2024 with $2.6 million raised and $2.1 million in cash. Last week, her campaign announced a $3.1 million haul for the first quarter — a figure she achieved despite being unable to raise money for much of the reporting period. As a sitting member of the legislature, Earle-Sears is barred from fundraising during the General Assembly session.
“Our campaign is proudly fueled by hardworking Virginians who want a leader who will cut taxes, defend parental rights, and keep our communities safe,” Earle-Sears said in a statement. “The threat of radical change that would turn our commonwealth in the wrong direction is real and demands we fight back directly and aggressively.”
Two independent candidates, Donna Charles and Andrew White, have also filed to run for governor. No campaign finance disclosures have been filed for either.
Stephen Farnsworth, a political science professor at the University of Mary Washington, said the absence of a gubernatorial primary gives both major candidates a strategic edge heading into November.
“This is the best case scenario for both of the candidates,” Farnsworth said. He noted that primaries often force contenders to cater to their party’s ideological base — sometimes at the expense of their appeal in a general election.
“If you go through the primary process, you will have to say a number of things to win over the ideological extremists who vote in primaries, and the things that you say in the spring can come back to haunt you in November,” he explained. “And now they don’t have to deal with it.”
For Republicans especially, Farnsworth added, the early clarity in the race is a rare bright spot. 
“With no primary, you can focus on the general election,” he said. “It’s a rare bit of good news for Republicans, who have a lot of headwinds coming out of Washington going into this election.”
 Crowded fields down-ballot

The lieutenant governor’s race has drawn large and diverse fields on both sides. Three Republicans are seeking the nomination: U.S. Navy veteran John Curran, Pat Herrity — the last remaining Republican on the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors — and conservative radio host John Reid.
The Democratic field is even more crowded, with six candidates vying for the nomination: attorney Alex Bastani; state Sens.

Marlow Jones, a member of the Petersburg City Council and a Republican, is also running for lieutenant governor — as an independent.
In the race for attorney general, Republican incumbent Jason Miyares is seeking a second term. Miyares, who made history in 2021 as the first Latino elected to statewide office in Virginia, is running unopposed in the GOP primary.
Two Democrats are competing for the nomination to challenge him in November. Former state Del. Jay Jones of Norfolk, who previously ran for attorney general in 2021 but lost the primary to then-incumbent Mark Herring, is back for another attempt. Henrico County Commonwealth’s Attorney Shannon Taylor, a veteran local prosecutor, is also seeking the Democratic nod.
 House races take shape

In the House of Delegates, all 100 seats are on the ballot this year. Democrats are fielding 114 candidates in 96 districts, while Republicans are running 76 candidates in 66 districts. Democrats have primaries in 14 districts, and Republicans have primary contests in 10.
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC) on Monday announced a seven-figure investment in the campaigns of four incumbents in what they view as winnable districts — Dels. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William, Josh Cole, D-Fredericksburg, Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, and Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach. Each won their 2023 races by 3 to 6 percentage points.
DLCC pours money into Virginia races, citing ‘All eyes on 2025’

“The DLCC’s investment is a clear signal that the eyes of the nation are on Virginia — and for good reason,” said Amber Gantt, a spokeswoman for the Virginia House Democratic Caucus. “Our frontline delegates flipped some of the toughest districts in the state, and they’re already delivering real results for Virginians.”
The margin for control of the House couldn’t have been tighter in 2023, when just 975 votes statewide ultimately determined which party held the majority. That razor-thin outcome is a vivid reminder of how every district, and every ballot cast, could prove decisive in 2025.
Farnsworth, the political scientist, said that this year’s political landscape carries echoes of 2017, when Democratic enthusiasm surged in response to Donald Trump’s first presidency — a dynamic that appears to be resurfacing after Trump’s return to the White House.
“In a lot of ways this does look sort of like eight years ago, where you have a lot of motivated Democrats in part because of the energy within the party, but also because of the frustration with President Trump. Both of these dynamics seem to be present this year.”
Farnsworth cautioned that Republicans could face a turnout challenge if they fail to field candidates in enough down-ballot races — a challenge that hurt Democrats in the past.
“There is a potential problem, though, in a statewide election if you don’t have Republican candidates in a larger number of districts, because you may not be encouraging a Republican turnout,” Farnsworth said. 
“The more Republicans there are on the ballot in House of Delegates races, the more likely there’ll be people voting Republican up and down the ballot. That was one of the problems that the Democrats had four years ago were districts that didn’t have a Democratic name on the ballot, and that hurt (Democrat) Terry McAuliffe’s campaign.”
Only one GOP incumbent — Del. Terry Austin, R-Botetourt — faces a primary challenge this year, from Austen Schwend. 
On the Democratic side, several incumbents are being challenged from within their own party. 
Del. Patrick Hope, D-Arlington, faces Sean Epstein and Arjoon Srikanth in District 1. In Richmond’s District 81, Del. Delores McQuinn is up against Alicia Atkins, while in Virginia Beach, Del. Kelly Convirs-Fowler is being challenged by Brandon Hutchins in District 96.
Democrats are also making a concerted push into Republican-held territory, with candidates running in 43 GOP-leaning districts this year. 
Republicans, by contrast, are challenging Democratic incumbents in only 15 districts. The disparity is part of a broader Democratic strategy aimed at driving turnout — especially in areas that could also benefit Spanberger’s gubernatorial bid.

Sen. Lamont Bagby, D-Henrico, who chairs the Democratic Party of Virginia, said the stakes in this year’s elections have galvanized Democratic voters — and now the focus is on sustaining that momentum through November by winning back the governor’s mansion and increasing Democrats’ narrow 51-49 majority in the House.
“There’s no question that folks are energized headed into this election cycle, we just need to make sure to keep the energy up,” Bagby said.
Framing the governor’s race as a pivotal moment for Virginia’s future, Bagby described the contrast between the candidates as sharper than anything he’s seen in recent memory.
“We’ve heard it time and time again, but in my lifetime I don’t think there’s ever been a clearer choice between the two candidates for governor,” he said.
With that clarity, he added, comes a responsibility to channel enthusiasm into organizing and outreach — while recognizing that serious challenges remain.
“We are working to make sure we are prepared to move that energy in the right direction,” Bagby said. “At the same time, we understand that there is a lot of work ahead, and some folks are committed to turn back the progress that we made related to health care and protecting families, we’ll just have to run through the tape.”
But Ken Nunnenkamp, executive director of the Republican Party of Virginia, downplayed the idea that more Democratic candidates equals more enthusiasm.
“I’m still not seeing an enthusiasm gap here. We’ve got a bunch of really good candidates,” Nunnenkamp said. “And at the end of the day, just because three or four people have filed in a Democratic primary, that doesn’t mean that there is any enthusiasm.”
Democrats seize on enthusiasm gap in 2025 Virginia House races

He also expressed skepticism that a broader Democratic field in rural districts would pay off for Spanberger in November.
“Four years ago, Terry McAuliffe went and worked his tail off trying to get votes in the rural districts, and he couldn’t do it because the Democratic message doesn’t resonate with a lot of people in those areas,” Nunnenkamp said. 
“I think (Spanberger) is going to spend as much time and money trying to turn out Democrats in those five districts where no Democrats are running, and I have a feeling just like last year, the Democratic message at the House of Delegates level is the same as it is on the statewide level. I think they’re going to have a horrible time.”
Still, Democrats are making history with their field. Of the 114 Democratic House candidates, 58 are women — including 27 incumbents — and at least seven are veterans. Eight veterans already serve in the chamber. By contrast, just five GOP incumbents are women, and a total of 17 Republican women are running for the House in 2025.
Independent candidates are rare this cycle, appearing in just four House districts. One of the most closely watched is District 50, where former Democrat Trudy Berry is now running as an independent after being denied ballot access last year due to an email error. 
Berry is up against Republican Del. Tommy Wright of Lunenburg and Democrat Earnadette Powell Farrar in a three-way contest that includes parts of Mecklenburg, Charlotte, Lunenburg, Prince Edward, and Halifax counties.

The Republican Party of Virginia announced on Saturday that former state Sen. Amanda Chase, a right-wing lightning rod who described herself as “Trump in heels,” had failed to gather enough signatures on qualifying petitions by that day’s deadline to appear on the Republican gubernatorial primary ballot.
That made Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears the party’s nominee, obviating the necessity for a Republican Primary in June. That created a direct, head-to-head general election match-up in November with former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, who is unopposed for the Democratic nomination.
A poll gives Spanberger an early edge, but  Musk and Trump may be her surest allies

But for unforeseen, tragic circumstances, the boys’ club that has been the office of governor since Patrick Henry in 1776 (or 1610 if you count colonial governors) will finally lose its monopoly. The glass ceiling will be shattered in a million jagged, crystalline pieces, waiting to be swept up and rightfully dumped into the dustbin of history.
It’s about time. Fifty-four women have served as governors in 32 states and two U.S. territories beginning with Wyoming’s Nellie Tayloe Ross in 1925, according to the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University. That includes 13 now serving as governors.
In Virginia, this is the first time both major parties will offer female nominees. One woman got within sight of the pinnacle without planting her flag on the summit.
In 1993, Democratic Attorney General Mary Sue Terry was considered an early shoo-in to succeed Gov. Doug Wilder, who had made history in 1989 as the nation’s first elected Black governor.
Terry, who had served in the House of Delegates, was the first woman to win statewide office with her election as attorney general in 1985. She easily won reelection in 1989, and was seen as the virtual incumbent after Democrats had held the Executive Mansion for the previous dozen years. One early poll showed Terry with a 29-percentage point advantage over her Republican foe, a former Virginia congressman known mostly as the namesake son of former Washington Redskins coach George Allen.
Terry was burdened by factors of her own making and those beyond her control. Her campaign often seemed adrift, going through the motions ahead of her inevitable coronation. But three consecutive Democratic administrations in Richmond and disappointment with first-year Democratic President Bill Clinton left voters feeling Virginia was on the wrong track. Wilder’s lingering, high-profile contretemps with Sen. Chuck Robb — a former Democratic governor and son-in-law of President Lyndon Johnson — did the party’s brand no favors, either.
By the closing weeks of the 1993 campaign, it was clear that the wheels had fallen off Terry’s campaign. Allen routed her by 18 percentage points, ending Terry’s political career and christening a Republican renaissance that reached its zenith in 2001 with the party holding every lever of elective government in Virginia for the first time in modern history.
No woman would win statewide office again until Earle-Sears was elected lieutenant governor in a 2021 GOP sweep of all three statewide offices plus a narrow House of Delegates majority. A former Marine who upset a longtime Democratic incumbent to win a House of Delegates seat in 2001, she is also the first African American woman to win statewide election.
Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears announces run for Virginia governor

I can’t help but wonder, though, about one of the most intriguing and promising candidates I’ve known.
Emily Couric was a Democratic member of the state senate serving Charlottesville, first elected in 1995 and re-elected in 1999.
She was smart and tireless, taking on the task of personally reading every piece of legislation on which she would vote, either in committee or on the floor. It paid off. She would find flaws in bills that would sometimes doom them or send patrons scurrying to make corrective amendments.
Emily was an unflinching Democrat, but she had many admirers on the other side of the aisle. She was a moderate who often found common ground with Republicans. She also had the “it” factor that made her a formidable contender in 2000 when she announced her candidacy for lieutenant governor the following year.
She was blessed with a lightning-quick wit that served her well in debates and could defuse tense, even acrimonious situations. And she had that unmistakable family smile that her kid sister, Katie, had made famous as a national television personality.
To this day, I wonder what if?
Emily had a clear shot at the nomination and, as it turned out, likely would have been elected lieutenant governor in 2001, a rebound year for Democrats with Mark Warner heading the ticket. Two weeks before that election, however, Emily was laid to rest after a determined fight with pancreatic cancer.
When she announced her diagnosis in July 2000, she dropped out of the race but remained in the Senate and, remarkably, signed on as co-chairman of the Democratic Party of Virginia despite the toll her treatment exacted. Richmond’s little-known mayor, Tim Kaine, filled her vacancy on the ticket and the seat she might have had on an amazing political odyssey. He served as governor, a vice presidential running mate and is in his third U.S. Senate term.
Every candidate brings different skillsets and choices to each unique election and, if they win, to a subsequent term of office. Political fortunes rise and fall because of them. We will never know if there might have been a Governor Couric. We can only ponder what might have been.
Now, a woman will get that chance. I take comfort knowing that there will be a Governor Spanberger or a Governor Earle-Sears.
Either way, her time has come.

undercuts his promise to deliver “radical transparency.” (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.





HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunica Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”
David Rousseau, the publisher of KFF Health News, serves on the board of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.
We’d like to speak with current and former personnel from the Department of Health and Human Services or its component agencies who believe the public should understand the impact of what’s happening within the federal health bureaucracy.

Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) takes questions from reporters at a press conference marking the opening of his congressional office in Lansing, Mich. on Monday, Jan. 13, 2025. | Kyle DavidsonU.S. Rep. Tom Barrett (R-Charlotte) said Monday that he is “not ready to give up” on tariffs issued by President Donald Trump “at this point” after a third day of global markets plummeting.
The freshman member of Congress said during a telephone town hall that the stock market “isn’t the entire American economy.”
“It’s an indicator of how our economy is doing, but it’s not reflective of the entire economy as a whole,” Barrett said.
He pointed to the U.S. adding 228,000 jobs in March, exceeding expectations, as an example.
Barrett said he is monitoring the situation and will “make sure we are doing everything we can to stabilize the market and ensure consumers don’t experience long-term pain.”
More than 5,000 people joined the call, Barrett’s office said, and he took questions on topics ranging from his support of a bill that would require proof of citizenship to vote in federal elections to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth’s use of a Signal group chat that unintentionally included the editor-in-chief of The Atlantic to communicate about plans to bomb Yemen.
While a constituent urged Barrett to vote against the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, or SAVE, the congressman said that not requiring proof of citizenship “discounts your vote or my vote from counting as an effective tool.”
A review by the Michigan Secretary of State’s office identified 15 individuals who allegedly cast ballots in the November presidential election despite not being U.S. citizens, representing less than 0.0003% of the 5.7 million ballots cast.
But Barrett pointed to Rep. Marianne Miller-Meeks, an Iowa congresswoman who won her election in 2020 by six votes, to explain why it is problematic for even a small number of potentially illegal ballots to be cast.
“That can make or break an entire race for the U.S. Congress, and there have been multiple bills that have passed on the floor of Congress by one vote this term alone,” Barrett said. “So six votes in one district can affect the outcome of that election, and that one vote in the House of Representatives or the U.S. Senate could affect the entire trajectory of legislation in this country.”

But while another SAVE Plan – former President Joe Biden’s Saving on a Valuable Education repayment plan for student loan borrowers – makes its way through the courts, one caller expressed concern about whether the Trump administration could place limits on Public Service Loan Forgiveness, a program that promises student loan forgiveness for any borrower who spends 10 years working in the public sector.
Barrett said that any changes to the program would have to be implemented in such a way that anyone currently on their way to loan forgiveness under the plan, signed into law by former President George Bush, would be held harmless.
“We want to make sure that people who are in the midst of that program and have modified their decision making about a career field are not seeing that taken away midstream,” Barrett said. “Nor do we want to see it retroactively taken away from people whose loan was forgiven because, of course, they’ve now made financial decisions based upon that.”
Responding to a question about the federal deficit and plans to extend the 2017 tax cuts, Barrett said that “at the end of the day, we have to be prepared to make tough decisions to streamline our government agencies and hopefully save us money and deliver better government assistance to people who need it most by protecting programs that really are critical.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/P1131448-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-08 06:04:36.342856

The company’s winning bid includes almost a quarter million dollars upfront and 18% of the well’s future revenue.
The Oil and Gas Land Management Commission has signed off on drilling beneath four state wildlife areas and Ohio’s biggest state park since it began approving bids two years ago.
Environmentalist groups have consistently opposed to the process without much success. An explosion earlier this year just outside Salt Fork State Park has only heightened those concerns. As commissioners approve more bids, opponents worry the next accident will damage public land.
Salt Fork State Park
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Austin Warehime grew up just outside Salt Fork State Park. As a kid, his dad would take him hiking or fishing in the park. He learned to drive in a Salt Fork parking lot and bought a truck with money he earned working at the park’s golf course.
At more than 17,000 acres, it’s the state’s largest park, and it sits right in the middle of Eastern Ohio’s fracking boom.
Warehime eventually moved away, got a law degree, and then decided to come back after he and his wife had a kid. Now he works for a local law firm representing landowners in negotiations over their mineral rights.
“The views here are honestly as broad as the spectrum that you can devise,” he said during a recent visit.
Plenty of residents fit in the “drill, baby, drill” camp, Warehime acknowledged, but there are also those who steadfastly oppose fracking. In between, “there’s a large contingent of people here who are fine with fracking being here and existing on private lands, and with private landowners making their own decisions.”
He chalked that up to a strain of ‘mind your own business’ libertarianism running through Appalachian communities.
“But when it comes to fracking on public lands,” he added, “There’s a large group of people in that middle there that just aren’t entirely convinced that what’s going on at Salt Fork is the right thing to do with our public lands.”

Earlier this year, the park began to see the fruits of opening public land to drillers. The Ohio Controlling Board signed off on $9.6 million in improvements at Salt Fork including a new beach shelter and asphalt resurfacing this March. But even those projects leave a bitter taste for Warehime.
“Only 30% of the money is required to stay here at Salt Fork and stay here in in Guernsey County, in the Salt Fork region,” he said, referencing the state statute that divvies up royalties from drilling on public land.
“That means 70% of the money has no guarantees that it is going to be used for Guernsey County, Eastern Ohio, Salt Fork, any of that,” he said. “I mean 70% of the money is leaving our region, and that’s kind of the story of Appalachia history in a nutshell.”
The Groh well pad
On Jan. 2, an explosion at the Groh well pad closed down a stretch of U.S. Rt. 22, about five miles from the Salt Fork State Park entrance and just 3.5 miles from the park boundary. First responders determined the safest course of action was to let to storage tank burn itself out.
Warehime’s sister lives across the road.

“You can just see the remnants of two of the large barrel-looking structures that that are on the well pad that burned and exploded,” he described. “You can see how discolored they are. They’re black, they’re charred, and they’re still standing there.”
The well pad sits a few hundred yards from the driveway where he was speaking.
“You can see it very clearly with the naked eye,” Warehime said. “You don’t have to squint or anything. It’s close.”
Another home, on the same side of the road as the well pad, is even closer.
According to a fire department report, a tank holding drilling brine caught fire, and nearby tanks started heating up rapidly. First responders described the burning tank as “cherry red” but decided putting the fire out would be risky.
“It was determined that the application of water might cause the cherry red steel of the tank to tear,” the report reads.
The tank burned for about 16 hours before it “self-extinguished.”
In a statement not long after, Ohio Department of Natural Resources spokeswoman Karina Cheung said the agency was working with local fire officials to investigate what happened.
“All produced fluids have been safely removed,” she said. “There was no release of fluids into the environment and the well pad remains shut down and inactive. There were no reported injuries, no reported impacts to wildlife, and no reported impacts to water.”
The fire department’s report lists the cause of the explosion as “undetermined.”
After an incident, the company is supposed to produce a follow up report within 30 days providing more detail on what happened and why. The Ohio Capital Journal has requested a copy of that report, but ODNR did not make it immediately available. The agency did not respond to follow up questions about the delay.
The company that operates the well pad, Gulfport Energy, has been fined in the past for safety violations, but does not appear to have received any punishment for the explosion in January.
The Capital Journal requested comment from the company about steps it’s taken to improve safety, but didn’t receive a response.

Threats creep closer
In February 2024, the commission approved a pair of bids from Infinity Natural Resources Ohio to drill beneath Salt Fork State Park. Between the two offers, Infinity put up close to $60 million for access to the park in addition to pledging 20% of its drilling revenue.
Although its Gray well pad is the first to stretch into the park, the pad itself is located about two miles away. On a recent afternoon, workers had set up a massive tower to extend the drill bore three-plus miles into Salt Fork.
“I haven’t actually been out here to see that yet,” Warehime said, peering out the window. “It’s a little sobering to actually see it occurring.”

The well pad sits on a well-paved but narrow road not far from U.S. Rt. 70. There are a handful of other wells in the vicinity, and every couple hundred feet there are signs posted to direct truck traffic.
“One of the protections,” Warehime said with air quotes, “is that all these producers have to have approval to drive on certain roads. There’s one now telling Ascent Resources where they can go to access a well.”
“It’s some protection,” he allowed, “but that means they’re still driving on these roads and tearing them up, and then the public is still paying the tax for that.”
Traffic near the Landman well underscored the issue. Big trucks passed in and out of the well site, less than a mile from the park entrance.
“There’s another dump truck,” Warehime said. “This is just a small county road, I mean, we’ve got to pull off to the side to let this go through.”
Environmentalists worry those close quarters aren’t just dangerous for drivers. If a truck hauling away drilling brine got in an accident, a spill could be toxic.
The Landman well sits in a nook with Salt Fork surrounding it on three sides. The park entrance is just shy of a mile away as the crow flies, but the closest boundary is less than half a mile.
“This well was not permitted to go underneath of the park,” Warehime explained, “so even though it’s very close, it’s going down, it’s going right up to the edge of the park, and then it’s shooting to the south.
“If you’re out hiking at the park, or you’re near the main entrance of the park, you’re not really gonna notice any effects from the Gray pad,” he said. “While they’re actively drilling at Landman, you may actually hear (it) or see the flare from that.”

Pressing forward
At the same meeting that the Oil and Gas Commission approved fracking beneath the Leesville Wildlife Area, they agreed to start accepting bids for two more parcels of state land. One covers a different part of the Leesville Wildlife Area and the other is land controlled by the Department of Transportation along State Road 149 in Belmont County.

Nominations for another wildlife area and state road right of way are teed up for the next meeting.
Continuing a longstanding pattern, public comments about the nominations were almost universally against them. But as the commission moved through its agenda, it took up one item after another, voting to advance them without discussion. Audience members interjected “what were the public comments?” and “what’s the environmental impact?”
But the commission’s motions and approvals marched forward undeterred. The whole effort took less than 14 minutes. Before Chairwoman Theresa White adjourned, Commissioner Jim McGregor attempted to defend their actions.
“ODNR, of course, has a number of scientific divisions that do review these and do make comments where they think its appropriate,” he said.
McGregor pointed to new limits on drilling operations to avoid interrupting hunting seasons and better protect water.
“It may seem like we’re approving these without a lot of discussion,” he said, “but there is a lot of discussion.”
The audience was unimpressed with the new lease terms.
One woman jeered, “What do you want a medal?”

(Justin Rex for The Texas Tribune)Cities and states fighting a historic measles outbreak find themselves undermined by the Trump administration as they struggle to provide crucial vaccinations and overcome disinformation. As of this week, cases were nearing 650 in 22 states, on track to reach a 34-year high.
A second unvaccinated child died of measles in West Texas last week. U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. attended her funeral Sunday and called vaccination “the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles” in a social media post.
Yet, as experts have noted, Kennedy has promoted vaccine skepticism and pitched alternatives such as cod liver oil and vitamin A to prevent measles — neither of which works. A top vaccine expert working under Kennedy resigned in protest.
Abrupt cutoffs in federal funding under President Donald Trump have also crippled some state efforts to vaccinate people against measles and other diseases.
A third death in New Mexico, of an unvaccinated adult who tested positive for measles, remains under investigation. Before vaccination started in 1963, measles caused as many as 500 deaths a year in the United States.
Measles outbreak mounts among children in one of Texas’ least vaccinated counties

The most important things states can do are providing vaccine clinics, testing quickly for measles, and tracing the contacts of people with identified cases, as well as fighting misinformation on vaccines, said Dr. Susan Kansagra, chief medical officer for the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials.
“Measles is one of the most contagious diseases, so one of the roles of public health is working to identify others that might have been exposed,” Kansagra said of contract tracing.
Despite vaccines’ effectiveness, recent federal funding halts have crippled state and local efforts to vaccinate more people not only for measles but also for this year’s deadly influenza viruses and COVID-19. On April 3, a federal judge in Rhode Island agreed to temporarily block the Trump administration from pulling $11 billion in federal health grants from states after a court challenge by Democratic states.
But in the days before the judge’s order, measles response plans came to a crashing halt in parts of Minnesota, Texas and Washington state when federal health grants were abruptly cut off. Dozens of free vaccination clinics in the Dallas area were canceled overnight. On March 24, Washington state was forced to cancel 104 upcoming “Care-a-Van” mobile clinics that would have provided 2,000 vaccinations against childhood diseases, including measles.
In Minnesota, where $220 million in previously approved federal health funding was cut off, the state announced layoffs April 1, including some positions supporting measles vaccination and other disease response. Minneapolis vaccination clinics were canceled March 26.
“The sudden and unexpected action from the federal government left us with no choice” but to lay off workers, Minnesota health commissioner Dr. Brooke Cunningham said in a statement. “We are working now to figure out how much of this critical public health work we can save and continue.”
Alarm among experts
Experts regardless of political affiliation have expressed alarm about federal moves to abandon support for vaccines. They include the nation’s top vaccine expert at the Food and Drug Administration, Dr. Peter Marks, who was appointed to the position in 2016.
In his resignation letter March 28, Marks said the measles outbreak “reminds us of what happens when confidence in well-established science underlying public health and well-being is undermined.” He accused Kennedy of seeking only “subservient confirmation of his misinformation and lies” about vaccines in general.
Vaccination rates are declining. They might get worse as states relax rules.

Dr. Scott Gottlieb, who served as FDA commissioner in the first Trump administration and is now a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said the measles outbreak could easily worsen and cost the United States its “eliminated” status, which was declared in 2000 based on the “absence of the continuous spread” of the disease.
“I don’t think we’re headed into a good place,” Gottlieb said, speaking March 31 on CNBC. “He [Kennedy] has been very focused on dismantling components of the vaccine enterprise in this country.”
Measles is so contagious that it can spread to 90% of unvaccinated people near an infected person. The virus can linger in the air up to two hours after an infected person has coughed or sneezed. Symptoms of the disease include high fever, cough, runny nose and rash, leading to a severe lung infection. Rare severe cases can cause swelling of the brain and death. Measles is most dangerous for infants, pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.
In Texas there are already signs that misinformation and vaccine skepticism may be feeding a rise in measles cases. The state had 499 cases as of April 6.
A Lubbock hospital reported that several unvaccinated children were treated for vitamin A toxicity, apparently in response to Kennedy’s recommendations to take vitamin A and cod liver oil.










Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to is to be vaccinated.


– Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health


Dr. Ashish Jha, who worked on COVID-19 vaccine plans under the Biden administration, said vitamin A treatment is appropriate in parts of Africa where vitamin deficiency is a factor, but not often in the United States.
“In Texas and Louisiana and New Mexico and Ohio and Pennsylvania, where we’re seeing a lot of these outbreaks, vitamin A is going to do very little for kids because they already have plenty of vitamin A,” Jha said.
“Really, the only thing that helps is making sure you don’t get measles — and the only way to do that is to is to be vaccinated,” said Jha, who is now dean of Brown University’s School of Public Health.
State responses
The current outbreak is on track to surpass 2019, when there were nearly 1,300 cases, and to be the worst year for measles since 1991 when there were more than 9,600 cases.
Local and state health officials in Texas also warned against “measles parties” where people try to expose themselves and their children to the disease hoping to gain immunity. Measles can cause severe complications and death even in otherwise healthy people, state officials warned.
New Mexico has opened 22 free walk-in measles vaccine clinics around the state, including two in Lea County, where most of the cases are located, near the Texas border. The state is also trying to head off more infections in Guadalupe and Valencia counties, where a traveler from Texas may have exposed people to measles in early March at a restaurant, hotel, church and travel center.
Funding cutbacks forced New Mexico to cancel contracts for vaccination outreach to potential clients in underserved communities, but the state has not interrupted its own public service messages or vaccine clinics, said New Mexico Department of Health spokesperson Robert Nott.
Flu deaths rise as anti-vaccine disinformation takes root

Kansas, where there are 24 known cases, recommended early vaccination for children in affected areas — starting at 6 months of age instead of the usual 1 year. The state also put doctors on alert to watch for symptoms such as fever and rash among unvaccinated people and offered expedited testing for suspected measles cases. Kentucky, with only one case, requires doctors to send such tests directly to the state for faster processing.
As in other states, almost all the Kansas cases are among unvaccinated people. Only one person with measles was fully vaccinated, and another case is not clear.
Colorado, where the state’s first case was reported March 31 in an unvaccinated Pueblo resident, state officials were already sending reminder texts and emails about vaccination to parents because of cases in nearby Texas and New Mexico. They also warned residents who may have been exposed at a restaurant and clinic in Pueblo and Pueblo West in March.
In New Mexico, there’s been an encouraging increase in measles vaccinations since the outbreak, said Nott. There were almost 15,000 new vaccinations in February and March, up from about 8,200 in the same period last year, he said.
On April 2, New York state warned residents to get vaccinated before traveling to areas with measles outbreaks. In March, the Pan American Health Organization said measles outbreaks in North and South America could endanger the region’s status as “measles-free.”
Some states are working to locate people who, residents or not, may have exposed others while traveling. New Jersey has three cases among residents, all members of one family, but is seeking people exposed to measles by travelers on an Amtrak train, at Newark Liberty International Airport, in hospitals and at other places in March.
A March editorial in The Lancet, a medical journal, said the recent measles outbreaks “should be taken as a wakeup call” for more vaccinations.
“People should be encouraged to listen to factual scientific evidence and verified sources. Awareness of the safety of the measles vaccine needs to be spread to combat the viral misinformation against it,” the editorial stated.

Bryan King, R-Green Forest, speaks against Senate Bill 354, the $750 million Franklin County prison appropriation, on the Senate floor on Monday, April 7, 2025. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Senate continued to block a $750 million prison appropriation bill Monday when it voted down the legislation for the fourth time in the last week. 
Senate Bill 354 would support construction of a 3,000-bed prison in Franklin County, which proponents say is needed to address overcrowding in county jails. Several elected officials and local residents in the western Arkansas county have publicly opposed the estimated $825 million project since Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders in October announced the state’s purchase of 815 acres near Charleston for the prison for nearly $3 million.
The bill’s lead sponsor, Sen. Jonathan Dismang, R-Searcy, told the Advocate Monday that he’ll keep running SB 354 until it receives the required 27 votes it needs to advance out of the Senate. While most bills require a simple majority, appropriation bills require a three-fourths majority vote.
SESSION SNAPSHOT: Arkansas lawmakers settle into longer days as session end draws near

Lawmakers have set April 16 as the final day to approve bills during the legislative session. The governor’s office, the Arkansas Board of Corrections and Joe Profiri, former corrections secretary and current senior adviser to Sanders, will continue answering lawmakers’ questions throughout the remaining days of the session, Dismang said. 
“We still have a good group of members, even though, who are voting no, who are saying they just need a couple pieces of additional information,” he said. “My goal right now is to keep making sure that everyone’s aware that there are some questions outstanding and try to get those questions answered.”
Sen. Alan Clark, R-Lonsdale, told guests of a legislative breakfast Friday in Benton that he expects the governor to call a special session to secure the prison funding if SB 354 doesn’t pass by next week, The Saline Courier reported. A similar situation happened last year when Sanders called a special session in June as a result of lawmakers’ failure to pass an appropriation bill for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission during the 2024 fiscal session. 
The Arkansas Legislature meets for regular legislative sessions in odd-numbered years and fiscal sessions in even-numbered years. In the interim, the governor may call legislators into special session and set the agenda. Lawmakers may consider legislation outside of the governor’s call with a supermajority vote, but that’s uncommon.
Sen. Bryan King, R-Green Forest, continued to speak against SB 354 on the Senate floor Monday. King, a longtime critic of the prison, again challenged transparency with the project, noting that a social media post by Franklin County Judge Rickey Bowman disputes an assertion that the governor’s office has stayed in close contact with local leaders.
“JUST TO BE CLEAR, NO ONE FROM LITTLE ROCK HAS REACHED OUT TO ME!” Bowman wrote. “I wish they would and open their eyes to the fact that is [sic] is going to cost the taxpayers an ungodly amount of money. It will be the most expensive site to build on.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Arkansans opposed to the project have been critical of state officials not involving local officials in the process. They also have voiced concerns about how difficult it would be to build on the rocky terrain and to access the needed infrastructure to support a 3,000-bed facility. 
At the Arkansas Board of Corrections’ meeting Thursday, representatives with Vanir Construction Management, the company retained to oversee the firm selected to build the prison, discussed building pipelines to bring in drinking water and wastewater from Fort Smith, a city roughly 27 miles west of the construction site. 
“That is exactly what we talked about. When you build a facility, you should have already known about this on the front end,” King said. “This is inconceivable that we should come in here and all of a sudden be trying to figure out where you’re going to get water.”
King also called for the expansion of the Calico Rock prison on the Senate floor and in a letter addressed to the corrections board signed by the Green Forest Republican and Sen. Gary Stubblefield, a Branch Republican whose family owns land near the proposed prison site. 
“Arkansas cannot afford to spend millions more to build a mega prison when a considerably less expensive option is available at Calico Rock,” the letter reads. “Please do not let [Profiri’s] reckless behavior hurt Arkansans. Those millions can be put to better use providing tax relief, educating students, and assisting our elderly population.”
Former Gov. Asa Hutchinson proposed expanding the Calico Rock facility by roughly 500 beds using surplus funds, and state lawmakers approved $75 million in reserve funds for that project in December 2022. 
But the proposal was put on hold when Sanders threw her support behind the Protect Arkansas Act, a 2023 law that, among other things, removes the possibility of parole for the state’s most serious offenders. The law makes it more likely that the number of state prisoners will grow.
The Legislature set aside $330 million in 2023 to support the governor’s prison expansion efforts, but disputes between the executive branch and the corrections board, and among state lawmakers, have delayed the project.
Support in the Senate for SB 354 has fluctuated between 18 and 19 affirmative votes. On Monday, 19 senators again voted for the measure while 10 opposed it. Six voted present. 
Democrats Fred Love, Reginald Murdock and Jamie Scott have consistently voted present on the measure. On Monday they were joined by Republicans Scott Flippo, John Payton and Dan Sullivan. 
Flippo has voted three times in favor of the bill, while Payton has voted against SB 354 twice and voted present twice. Sullivan has cast votes for, against and present. 
The Senate will next meet at 1 p.m. Tuesday.

President Trump has imposed broad 25% tariffs on Canadian imports. It remains unclear whether these tariffs apply to electricity (the Trump administration issued no clarification), an intangible good that has never before been subject to import duties.
The Northeast has long been a leader in clean energy innovation, setting ambitious goals to transition to a more sustainable, affordable, and reliable power grid. Tariffs of this magnitude on clean Canadian electricity imports are a direct attack on affordability, burdening U.S. consumers with an estimated $400 million in additional costs annually.
These tariffs will be felt particularly during peak-demand periods, when the Northeast’s reliance on Canadian electricity is most acute. During these hours, tariffs could increase wholesale electricity prices by up to 30%. These costs disproportionately affect working families and small businesses that are already struggling with high energy costs.
At a time when states like Massachusetts and New York are working to expand clean energy infrastructure and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the artificial price increases from tariffs will drive clean and affordable hydroelectricity from Canada out of energy markets. The result is the opposite effect of what our state policies seek and instead will drive up costs and push the region further into dependence on natural gas and oil.
Massachusetts alone is expected to see a $200 million increase in electricity if 25% tariffs are imposed on Canadian electricity imports.
Beyond the financial impact, tariffs will undermine the reliability of the Northeast’s power grid. Just this year, during the coldest periods of January and February, Canadian energy exports accounted for 10% of New York’s demand and 15% in New England, rising to 20% during peak-demand hours.
With the added tariff costs on imports, our region will inevitably rely more heavily on fossil fuel plants that are vulnerable to fuel supply shortages and price spikes during extreme weather events. The energy market works by selecting the least expensive form of energy available to provide the required amount of energy demanded by the market. If tariffs make otherwise affordable Canadian hydroelectricity more expensive than oil and gas, the market will choose those less costly sources.
Some parts of our region are especially vulnerable. Certain rural areas in Vermont and Northern Maine, which are directly linked to electric grids in Canada and have no viable alternative supply, could be hardest hit. Tariffs could lead to millions of dollars in increased costs annually, exacerbating energy insecurity for residents who already face higher-than-average electricity prices.
Imposing tariffs on Canadian hydroelectricity is not just bad economics—it’s bad climate policy. With the withdrawal of this affordable, clean energy source, the region will be forced to burn more natural gas and oil, leading to an estimated 10 million additional tons of carbon emissions annually — annual emissions equivalent to those emitted by every car registered in New York City.
This is a step backward at a time when we should be accelerating our clean energy transition. The Northeast has set aggressive goals to cut emissions and transition to 100% clean power, yet these tariffs will make clean energy less competitive, slowing progress toward a carbon-free grid.
Supporters of these tariffs argue that they will level the playing field for domestic energy producers but, in reality, they will undermine the market forces that are driving innovation and competition in the clean energy sector.
They completely ignore the interconnected nature of the U.S.-Canadian electricity system, which has historically provided economic, reliability, and environmental benefits to both countries. Just last week, New York State released a report assessing tariff impacts. State agencies conclude that “losing access to Canadian imports during the peak summer cooling months could create significant reliability challenges.”
New York and New England cannot afford to let anything but the public interest and cost dictate energy policy. These tariffs will raise prices, reduce reliability, and set back the clean energy transition at a time when we need to accelerate progress, not stall it.
Governors, legislators, and regulators in the Northeast must visibly stand together against these tariffs, advocating for continued access to affordable, clean electricity. Businesses, labor groups, and community organizations must also speak out, making it clear that these policies will harm local economies, cost jobs, and increase energy burdens for working families.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care, or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people, and people with disabilities.
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state.
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits, or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah, and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work, and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, accounted for only 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status. And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

From changes to Medicaid to elimination of lead abatement funding, the Ohio House budget proposal concerns many who have championed child wellbeing and improvement of metrics with which Ohio struggles, like infant mortality, as important budget priorities.
“It just felt like they had taken a hacksaw to some of these line-items without real consideration to what they did,” said Kathryn Poe, budget and health researcher for the think tank Policy Matters Ohio.
Poe said it seems as though state legislators are taking cues from the federal government are trying to drastically cut spending, but that don’t improve the state in the process.
“These cuts at the federal level also feel really haphazard,” Poe said. “But the state doesn’t have the amount of money or time or influence to make these sort of haphazard cuts.”
Specifically, Poe sees the elimination of Ohio’s Medicaid expansion as a significant change that will create struggles for low-wage workers who count on Medicaid for their health insurance, and who will be prevented from planning for the future without the ability to count on proper health insurance.
As Poe put it, “what do you do when 700,000 people lose their insurance overnight?”
The House’s version of the budget absorbed a proposal by Gov. Mike DeWine in his executive budget that creates a trigger effect, eliminating Group VIII, or the Medicaid expansion eligibility group, “if the federal government sets the federal medical assistance percentage below (its current level of) 90%,” according to budget documents.
The federal medical assistance percentage (or FMAP) refers to the amount of federal funding the state receives for Medicaid, based on a state’s per capita income.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe expansion group is made up of Ohioans ages 19 to 64 who have household incomes of less than 138% of the federal poverty line and aren’t eligible in other Medicaid categories. According to the Health Policy Institute of Ohio, the Medicaid expansion “has been a major contributor to Ohio’s uninsured rate dropping by half from 14% in 2010 to 7% in 2022.”
The group said the expansion has also improved access to care, with data showing a 31% decrease in Ohioans who went without care due to cost from 2013 to 2023.
According to the state, the expansion population caseload is projected to be 779,000 Ohioans in fiscal year 2026, and 772,000 in 2027. That would account for more than $13.5 billion in expenditures over the two fiscal years.
Without the expansion, workers under the program would be less likely to have insurance, partly because many workers earning less than 138% of the federal poverty line are working jobs where they aren’t given enough hours to receive medical benefits, such as entry-level retail jobs or customer service.
Citing data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the Health Policy Institute of Ohio said even workers in the skilled trades like electricians and medical assistants could lose benefits, considering the federal poverty level of 138% for a family of three represents an annual income of $36,777.
“It would be a devastating economic loss,” Poe said. “The answers (for Ohioans who would lose the coverage) are everything from going to the emergency room, to not getting care, to letting that pain in your abdomen go on so long that you have to go to the emergency room anyway.”
The budget proposal comes amid attempts by DeWine and the state to apply work requirements to that particular group of Medicaid participants.
Not only will it create expensive health decisions, but the ripple effects will extend to the ability to afford groceries or have reliable transportation, according to Poe.
Those effects would trickle all the way down to Ohio’s children as well, according to advocates. Groundwork Ohio criticized a House measure that would end a requirement that the Medicaid department “seek approval to provide continuous Medicaid enrollment for Medicaid-eligible children from birth through age three
Budget documents say the change could create “possible service cost savings.”
Groundwork called on the legislature to take back the changes, saying nearly 48% of all Ohio children under the age of 6 “depend on Medicaid for health coverage.”
“The program covers about half of all births in the state and thousands of Ohio women rely on Medicaid to ensure a healthy pregnancy and support postpartum recovery,” according to an analysis of budgetary proposals in the House draft.
The organization also criticized a provision of the budget that would limit Medicaid coverage for doulas, leaving the coverage for only the six counties with the highest infant mortality rates.
The House plan also cuts pediatric cancer research by $5 million and eliminates lead abatement programs within the Ohio Department of Health. Groundwork Ohio noted the lead abatement program as part of their analysis of the budget plan, saying Ohio has “nearly double the national rate of children with elevated blood lead levels.”
“Even small amounts of lead exposure in early childhood can harm the brain, delaying growth and development, and may cause learning, behavior, speech and other health problems,” the group stated.
Advocates have already been publicly critical of the House plan to slash public education funding and drop a child tax credit proposed by DeWine in his budget plan. But adding the Medicaid changes, along with reducing funding in the areas of child development and a $1.5 million cut to “infant vitality” programming just make things worse, advocates say.
“The House’s proposal represents a step backward at a time when we can least afford it,” said Lynanne Gutierrez, president and CEO of Groundwork Ohio, in a statement. “We urge lawmakers to fully restore these investments and prioritize Ohio’s future.”

As part of their ongoing effort to manipulate and capitalize on irrational white voter fears, state Republican lawmakers are advancing legislation this session that purports to attack quote “DEI” in public education.
Under the bill, state law would spell out a long list of supposedly “divisive concepts” that would be banned from public schools. For example, the bill says it will be illegal to teach that a quote “meritocracy” — whatever that is — is inherently “racist” or “sexist” — two words that are also not defined.
Of course, the purpose of this impossibly vague language is no mystery — it’s to discourage educators from discussions of America’s grim past on matters of race that might make white students uncomfortable.
And that would be a tragic mistake.
A simple amendment would help. Lawmakers should add a word to the bill to make clear that teaching divisive concepts is banned, but only if they are untrue.
The bottom line: Discussion of hard truths is an essential part of education that our kids can handle. Would that GOP lawmakers could as well.

(Getty Images)On Jan. 29, 2025, President Donald Trump issued an Executive Order that “Ends Radical Indoctrination in K-12 Schooling” that specifically emphasizes a “Patriotic education” that presents the history of America grounded in: “an accurate, honest, unifying, inspiring, and ennobling characterization of America’s founding and foundational principles” and “a clear examination of how the United States has admirably grown closer to its noble principles throughout its history.”
Trump’s view of a patriotic education portrays constant American excellence, but in truth, that is only one half of the story. Teaching the darkness of our past is not unpatriotic and highlights the change of where we as a country came from. Understanding both helps students develop their own sense of why this country is worth living in, why America is the home of liberty, and how we can uphold the values that are central to us.
In addition to these principles is the reestablishment of the 1776 Commission that started in 2020 to combat the conversation surrounding Nikole Hannah-Jones’ 1619 Project. Trump, along with many other conservatives, believe that the United States and its history education has built a curriculum on guilt rather than critical thinking. The order states that no one “should feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of psychological distress because of … actions committed in the past.” Trump and his supporters are convinced that history is being rewritten in the classroom, and that we are living in a time where students are taught to hate their country.
As a history teacher, I know this to be false and a direct attack on educators and historians alike. What I teach is the truth — both sides of the coin in order to present to students the bright and dark moments of our nation’s past. This includes slavery, racism, sexism, war, and violence. But it also includes political unity, memory, and movements. 
With the 250th anniversary of the United States’ birth happening next year, conversations among historians, teachers, politicians, citizens, and anyone interested creates an in-depth analysis of every part of the Revolution. From the military battles, political animosity, and various perspectives of individual lives, the Revolution is viewed from so many angles. The Revolution in our American memory is in the fabric of every movement.
In New Hampshire, Revolutionary War veteran John Stark coined the term “Live Free or Die,” which is on every license plate in the state next to the Old Man of the Mountain. What is too often forgotten is the rest of his statement: “death is not the greatest of evils” — which means that in order to protect our Republic, we must be willing to discuss its past. 
Liberty is the fundamental right in America, but only if we can keep it. Part of an education is understanding how to be a civic leader, and New Hampshire knows this value. In February of this year, a state representative introduced House Bill 283, which would eliminate the requirements of what makes up an “adequate education” in the state. Civics, history, art, and other humanities and science courses were part of the list to be discarded. Thousands upon thousands (including myself) gave feedback against the bill. So many people showed up to the hearing that they needed to move to a bigger room. 
The point is that New Hampshire parents, teachers, and students showed up because they know the value that history education (and other subjects) holds. With humanities programs being cut all over the country, the necessity for them has never been more apparent. With the kind of harmful rhetoric that a “Patriotic education” promotes, it emphasizes a dissolution of our past and transforms a false reality of what happened. Teachers describe the history of the nation as it was in order to explain why it is. 
History teachers do not make students feel guilty; we explain the perspectives of African Americans being enslaved; Native Americans in boarding schools; women during World War II, etc., while also connecting it all together to the larger picture of the famous people who helped craft our Republic. 
History is all about perspective, and sharing those with students naturally gives them a sense of where our country came from to encourage how they celebrate patriotism. It is not just July 4, but a lifelong understanding of where we came from.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/americanhistorylessons-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 05:03:50.973122

At least seven Ohio State students have had their visas revoked as of Monday. 
“At this time, we do not have any indication why this action was taken,” university spokesperson Ben Johnson said in an email. “The students remain in the United States. The students, their attorneys and Ohio State are considering next steps.”
The New York Times has reported that U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio ordered diplomats overseas to go through the social media of student visa applicants to identify those who have criticized the United States and Israel and potentially bar them from entering the country.
“The speech of people on student visas is still protected, but it doesn’t always protect their immigration status,” the Times reports on the legality of Trump’s immigration crackdown. “International students are especially vulnerable to deportation because of the temporary nature of their legal status.”
A Kent State international student and three recent graduates with Optional Practical Training post-graduate work permits have also had their visas revoked, according to a letter last week from university president Todd Diacon.
“We are working to connect with each of these individuals to ensure they are aware of this change in their status,” Diacon said in his letter. “Kent State was not given advanced notice nor specific reasons for these decisions.”
Federal authorities have revoked the visas of “a small number of international students here at UC,” according to a letter from University of Cincinnati President Neville G. Pinto. 
“UC representatives are in touch with each of our impacted students, and we are doing what we can to support them during this incredibly challenging time,” Pinto said. “While we are aware that this is happening at universities across the nation, we have not been contacted by authorities, nor have we been given specific reasons for these revocations.”
Two Akron students had their visas revoked, according to Signal Akron. The university did not respond to the questions from the Capital Journal. 
Many international students across the United States have had their visas revoked. The Trump administration issued an executive order on his first day in office ordering the State Department to review all visa programs and make sure foreign nationals do not pose a threat to national security. 
Bowling Green State University said it was not aware of any international students who have had their visas revoked.
Central State University, Cleveland State University, Miami University, Ohio University, Shawnee State University, the University of Toledo, Wright State University, and Youngstown University did not respond to the Capital Journal’s questions by deadline.

Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine visited a public school Monday morning, hearing from teachers and kids about literacy efforts. But schools like Hamilton Elementary School in Columbus may have to undergo massive cuts under the proposed state budget.
The governor was asked about the possible elimination of the Fair School Funding Plan in the budget and whether he’s heard the concerns of teachers, students, and parents.
“Sure, look, I received communication from parents, communication from school superintendents,” the governor responded. “What I tell them is they’re doing the right thing. They should make their point of view available to the governor, but they also should do it to their legislators.”
Parents such as Kia Woodward are stressing about school funding for their kids.
“It’s disheartening to see that people are trying to shut (public school) doors and just trying to shut it with funding,” Woodward said.
While Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, and Finance Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, say the state doesn’t have enough money to fully fund public education — slashing its expected budget by hundreds of millions — the same leaders have given even more money to the private school voucher system, which funnels taxpayer dollars to nonpublic schools.
In the Ohio House Republican proposed budget, public schools would get about a $220 million increase, while private schools are set to receive double that — $500 million.
Huffman and Stewart argue that what they are doing is actually giving more over the biennium than in FY25 to public schools, just not as much as they had hoped — or were expecting due under the Full School Funding Plan.
“Well, when you see the proposal, which was, ‘We’ll just increase the inputs to FY ’24,’ that was the ask — it cost $1.8 billion to the taxpayer,” Stewart responded. “We simply don’t have it.”
That is misleading, Democrats argue.
“What is being produced is likely one of the lowest state shares in our state’s history… meaning that it’s even less state money going into our schools than when this was deemed unconstitutional,” Finance Ranking Member Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Cleveland, said.
“You have the privilege to send your kid wherever you want to, and you’re gonna use my tax dollars to do it, and I don’t have the right for my kids to go to school and be in a safe building,” Woodward said.
Parent and conservative activist Greg Lawson is on the other side of the debate — arguing that dollars are best served following each individual child to the best school of choice.
“I spend a lot of tax money, my tax money… I want a little bit of that back so that I am able to put my student where I think it’s the right thing,” Lawson said.
Some Republicans argue that poor-performing school districts may not be spending money wisely. Woodward responded that public schools face audits, while nonpublic schools don’t have to follow transparency guidelines.
“I think that we could have some further conversation about that,” he said. “I think we want to be very careful on how we do it because what we don’t wanna see happen is a heavy hand of the government coming in and then dictating certain things from a curriculum standpoint.”
The governor sits in the middle of this debate, saying he wants to protect public schools — despite cutting $100 million from what they were expecting, as well — while also providing choice for families.
“We are still early on this process,” DeWine said.
The budget will likely be passed out of the House this week, but it still has to go through the Senate.

As the Cleveland Browns inch closer to getting $600 million in bonds from Ohio taxpayers, one Democratic lawmaker has introduced a bill prohibiting state dollars from going to teams with losing records.
The Browns went 3-14 last season.
The franchise wants to leave Cleveland for a new entertainment district and dome in Brook Park. This would cost $2.4 billion. The team says it will pay $1.2 billion, and the public would foot the rest of the bill — $600 million from local jurisdictions such as — a reluctant — Cuyahoga County, and the remaining $600 million from the state.
State Sen. Bill DeMora, D-Columbus, doesn’t think the team is worth the money.
“If a team wants to get taxpayer money, then the least they can do is have a winning season, and if they decide that they want to move, then the people of Ohio deserve their money back,” DeMora said.
The bill would require teams to have winning records for three of the five past seasons. The Bengals, who have their own stadium finance needs and who were left out the House’s budget proposal, have had a winning record in four of the last five seasons.
The Browns’ plans are now being debated in the court of public opinion. Last week, Browns officials appeared at a town hall in Hudson at the request of a Democratic state lawmaker. Some attendees used the opportunity to make their voices heard.
It is unlikely this bill will move in the GOP-controlled legislature, but DeMora said it sends a message.

The company has met with community resistance. (Allison Kite/Kansas Reflector)





It’s been said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. Apparently, private prison company CoreCivic never got the memo.
Earlier this year, CoreCivic announced plans to re-open its shuttered Leavenworth jail as an immigration detention facility. Until it was shut down in 2021, Leavenworth Detention Center was plagued by violence, abuse, and mismanagement. In 2021 alone, attorneys reported two suicides and at least 10 severe beatings and stabbings of incarcerated individuals and employees alike. Correctional officer vacancies reached as high as 23%, while incarcerated individuals frequently reported insufficient food, medical care and access to legal counsel. Other reports of serious harm remain hidden due to the lack of transparency in CoreCivic’s facilities.
A U.S. district court judge summarized it best: The prison was “an absolute hell hole.”
CoreCivic’s plan to re-open this notorious facility and target immigrants has been met with public outcry. Pushback was so significant that CoreCivic applied, then withdrew from Leavenworth’s special use permit application process and the required public hearings. The city swiftly passed a unanimous resolution requiring CoreCivic go through the permit approval process and has now filed a federal lawsuit. The rush to staff the facility is a slap in the face to the community by one of the largest companies profiting off of human suffering.
CoreCivic campaigns on promises of “compassionate” detention and “good, dependable jobs.” But Leavenworth residents and previously detained individuals have seen through the PR spin.
At a recent city commission meeting, a former employee tearfully recounted being attacked at the understaffed Leavenworth Detention Center — which left her permanently disabled. Immigrants like Angel Argueta, who came to the U.S. after a hurricane destroyed his home and livelihood, know there is no compassion to be found in CoreCivic ICE facilities. At a Mississippi ICE center, Angel was left in a dark, solitary cell for days on end and told by guards that “the only way you leave this facility is if you die here.”
CoreCivic’s failures aren’t limited to Leavenworth. It operates criminal and immigration facilities across the country, many of which have long, sordid records of abuse and mismanagement. As attorneys and advocates, we have witnessed the devastating human cost of CoreCivic’s operations — whether it’s the 24-hour-a-day solitary confinement and rampant physical and sexual abuse suffered by those trapped inside, or the anxiety and stress endured by small-town workers left to manage the fallout.
The company wins over local leaders in towns like Leavenworth with enticing promises of profit, but those dollars rarely materialize. While localities deal with understaffing and horrific prison conditions, CoreCivic’s CEO made close to $6 million in 2023 – 96 times its median employee’s pay.
CoreCivic has repeatedly shown that it is incapable of running a humane facility. Now, the company flouts city approval to move forward with an ICE center based on false promises. CoreCivic officials have pledged not to “release any inmates or detainees into the Leavenworth community.” That statement is not only morally reprehensible, as the majority of immigrants detained by ICE are not dangerous and have no history of violent crime — it’s also legally unenforceable. CoreCivic can’t promise to ignore court orders and basic due process by continuing to hold immigrants who have been granted release or legal status in the United States.
Leavenworth and Kansas residents have made their voices clear: They don’t want this. With CoreCivic’s history of lies, failures, and inhumanity, can you blame them?

The weather was miserable, but people kept coming. They braved the rain and cold to put Donald Trump and his shadow president Elon Musk on notice that they will not surrender to tyrants on an egomaniacal quest for prolonged power at the expense of the free. This is personal.
Demonstrations ran through deep red Ohio counties, solid blue urban strongholds, and suburban tossup districts. Hundreds of protestors rallied in Urbana, Republican Jim Jordan’s base. More than 200 Middletown residents, in Vice President JD Vance’s hometown, wanted the world to know “we are not all like him” as they protested at a local park and listened to anti-DOGE speeches. 
In small Ohio cities that went overwhelmingly for Trump in 2024 and large metropolitan areas that went overwhelmingly for Harris, the organic deluge of ordinary citizens swelling enormous crowds or lining up on sidewalks and roads as far as the eye could see, was a faith-restoring sight. On a soggy Saturday afternoon, Americans from all walks of life came from seemingly nowhere to join each other for their country, for their freedoms.

They stood shoulder-to-shoulder with homemade signs and American flags. Grandmothers, young parents with kids, a generational spread of Ohioans finding common cause in a defining crisis like no other. These were people with the most to lose under sledgehammer DOGE cuts, under the chaos and cruelty of an increasingly authoritarian police state. But from seniors to students, they showed up en masse to push back.
In solidarity with citizens marching across the country, they demanded the felon-in-chief and his erratic hatchet man keep their “Hands Off” earned Social Security benefits, Medicare coverage and lower prescription costs, Medicaid spending cuts, voting rights, reproductive freedom, veterans, education, history, cancer research, and 401(k) retirement savings accounts being absolutely decimated by Trump’s unforced tariff disaster. 
The eruption of anti-Trump protests at over 50 locations throughout Ohio and thousands more nationwide, came after two days of heavy losses in the stock market directly tied to Trump’s sweeping, nonsensical tariffs on all imports. Over $6 trillion was wiped off the value of 401(k)s. That’s a staggering amount of money gone in a market crash entirely self-inflicted.
Financial markets indicate another rough week with staggering losses as Trump digs in for no good reason and fears of a global recession grow. In a Sunday post, the tax fraud who bankrupted six companies, called his pointless tariff plan wreaking widespread damage “a very beautiful thing.” As markets continue to convulse with massive sell-offs, the “very stable genius” remains unperturbed. 
“I don’t want anything to go down,” said Trump, “but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.” Who cares if you put a sizable crack in the retirement nest egg of tens of millions of Americans after they spent a lifetime of saving in their 401(k)s or IRAs? Not the man who putted at Mar-a-Lago as markets crashed.

But the retirees who took to the streets in huge numbers recently are losing sleep over running out of money. Many no longer get paychecks and must withdraw from retirement accounts shrinking in real time. They don’t have years to recover from a stock market in free fall that keeps going down because of Trump’s insane tariff gambit. If lawmakers fail to put more checks and balances on his expansive trade war, countless older Americans could be collateral damage.  
The richest 1% will weather the madness but not the people fighting for their dignity and democracy in the rain. They are stone cold sober about the stakes of losing everything and are waking up to the power of E pluribus unum (out of many, one) to fight the tyranny of subjugation and impoverishment. So they assembled together in public resistance you couldn’t miss. 
At the Ohio Statehouse. On the Craig Memorial Bridge in Toledo. Near the West Side Market in Cleveland. Outside the U.S. District Court in Youngstown. At Courthouse Square in Dayton. In Cincinnati’s Washington Park. Lining Fulton Drive NW in Canton. Down Commerce Lane in Bluffton. In front of the Sandusky Mall. Outside the Guernsey County Courthouse in Cambridge and on and on. Every corner of the state. 
This is no right or left movement gaining traction. It is everyday Americans rising up and refusing to cede liberty and justice for all to a callous lawbreaker — backed by the entire Republican Party — who is hellbent on destroying two and a half centuries of a world-changing democratic experiment between rounds of golf. I suspect the Ohioans who showed up in a big way last weekend, and their counterparts in other states, won’t be the last. The torch has been picked up. Generations have sacrificed too much to preserve what is in grave danger of perishing today.  
But the gathering protests in Ohio and America give hope that the unfinished pursuit of a more perfect union is ongoing and still remarkably robust.

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare.
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state.
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets.
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state.
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.

8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

(Stock photo by Marco Piunti/Getty Images)Protecting children from online harm is a goal we all share, and there is no question that more needs to be done to keep them safe.
However, approaches like a current proposal in the Nebraska Legislature, the Age-Appropriate Online Design Code Act, bring a host of significant privacy concerns and could further expand the size and role of government, placing the government between the rights of parents and their children.
Changes like requiring age verification, as LB 504 does, threaten our most fundamental rights to free expression, risk exposing our data to cyber-attacks, and could lead to dangerous government censorship.
Database challenges
Forcing platforms like ours to collect identifying personal information on every single user imposes undue barriers to users’ exercise of constitutionally protected speech online.
This isn’t just inconvenient for users but is actively harmful to tech start-ups like ours as it suddenly forces us to maintain a massive database of sensitive information all in one place. That sort of database is ripe for theft by cybercriminals.
Moreover, it holds enormous and potentially disastrous consequences for free expression online: overly broad duty of care provisions would require any online platforms hosting user-submitted content to know the ages of every single user or risk litigation.
It is not hard to envision how this could pressure some platforms to remove or cease hosting user-submitted content to avoid liability exposure, casting a broad chilling effect on online speech and reducing the outlets users have for free expression online.
Risk of government overreach
Current kids’ online safety proposals aren’t just harmful. The government is expressly forbidden from making speech determinations under the First Amendment, for example, yet under these proposals would be determining what is and isn’t child-appropriate, a job for parents, not government.
Inserting government into that conversation threatens parental autonomy by depriving parents of the opportunity to choose what’s best for children, overstepping current regulations.
This new legislation would be burdensome to small businesses like ours. Moreover, there is no solid implementation framework in LB 504 to adequately address privacy concerns previously shared.
These regulations would likely stifle Nebraska’s growing Silicon Prairie, discouraging innovation and encouraging our best and brightest to leave for states with more reasonable rules.
At a time when it’s harder than ever to start a new business and brain drain continues to be one of our most pressing issues, we should be fostering an environment that creates technological advancements, particularly in artificial intelligence and digital security, that could improve online safety.
Parents know best
The right approach to child safety online is to put parents at the heart of this process and empower them to make the best decisions for their children. Only through education and parental empowerment can we make meaningful strides without depriving kids of crucial opportunities to learn and grow through interaction with the broader world online.
We should scale back heavy-handed regulations and promote a forward-thinking tech environment that positions Nebraska as a hub for innovation, free expression and the responsible development of emerging technologies.

Will Smith (D-Montgomery) about a package of immigrant protection bills Monday. (Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)After it was stalled for most of the day, a watered-down package of protections for Maryland’s immigrant community was rushed through by lawmakers with just minutes to spare before the midnight end of the legislative session Monday.
The version of House Bill 1222 that passed the House and Senate on mostly party-line votes includes language to help “sensitive locations” like churches and schools decide how to respond if immigration agent show, and it includes some privacy protections for migrant data.
What it does not include is language from the original House version of the bill that would require counties to work with federal immigration agencies in some respects, but would prohibit participation in so-called 287(g) agreements, in which local police can essentially act as immigration agents.
Migrant groups, who were at the State House all day monitoring the progress of the bills, said the 287(g) prohibition was their primary goal in the face of increased immigration enforcement by President Donald Trump’s Department of Homeland Security.
“It was shameful the way it went down. We knew what Trump was doing on immigration since day one,” said Ninfa Amador-Hernandez, policy analyst with the immigrant advocacy group CASA. “We’re seeing Democrats not act in protecting immigrant families.”
But with the clock ticking toward midnight Monday, Del. Jazz Lewis (D-Prince George’s) said the legislature was at risk of failing to pass any protections, so House members agreed to give in to the Senate and strike out the prohibitions on 287(g) agreements.
U.S. Supreme Court pauses order to return wrongly deported Maryland man

“Sometimes having a pressure cooker of a deadline to move things – we were unsure if we would get it done anyway,” Lewis said. “We think it (the amended bill) is balanced.”
HB1222 initially prohibited Maryland counties from entering into 287(g) agreements to work cooperatively with agents of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That was the bill’s only function when it was introduced back in early February.
In the last-minute amendment, the bill includes language from another bill called the Sensitive Locations Act, which would require the Attorney General to “provide guidance to state agencies and others to rules regarding immigration enforcement,” said Del. Luke Clippinger (D-Baltimore City), the chair of the House Judiciary Committee. The bill also prevents the sale of personal records and other data to third parties, he said, though the amendment text is not yet publicly available.
But Cathryn Jackson, policy director for CASA, said the prohibition on 287(g) agreements would have had the “greatest impact” for Maryland’s immigrant population.
“287g is such a direct funnel into the deportation machine. It is the most direct way that we are carrying out Trump’s agenda in Maryland,” Jackson said.
“I think it is extremely heartbreaking that the immigration bills have not been prioritized,” she said. “That is leaving the lives of so many people up to chance right now.”
CASA members are blaming the failure of 287(g) on the Senate, even though Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) had said earlier Monday that “there is a limit” to what states can do when it comes to immigration enforcement with the federal government.
“We are doing whatever we can in this time frame. The challenge is – it is the federal government and there is a limit to which we have the ability to impact,” Ferguson told reporters.
“I can’t even fathom the fear that a number of our neighbors are feeling because of what’s happening with the Trump administration,” he said. “It is fundamentally unbelievable that we’ve created this toxic environment around people who are investing in our communities, who are part of our workforce, our kids are in school together.”
Gov. Wes Moore (D) said that the state would always cooperate with federal law enforcement, but disagrees with how the Trump administration is overstepping due process for immigration enforcement.
“We are never not going to cooperate with our federal partners to get violent criminals off of the streets – period, full stop,” Moore told reporters. “We have to make sure our communities are safe … I believe very deeply that you can both make sure you’re keeping your streets safe and also make sure you’re honoring the Constitution at the same time.”

Kennedy Jr.’s firing of public records staffers at federal health agencies undercuts his promise to deliver “radical transparency.” Win McNamee/Getty ImagesPublic access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunita Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)It was one of the first issues to surface this year, and one of the last to be resolved, but lawmakers Monday approved compromise legislation to trim the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future while keeping much of the multiyear plan intact.
The Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act passed Monday evening on largely party-line votes in the House and Senate. It delays implementation of “collaborative time,” preserves funding for community schools and protects students in poverty, those in special education and those in classes for non-English speakers from any potential per pupil funding cuts.
“These are the students who really need help with the Blueprint. There is no pause, cut in funding whatsoever,” said Del. Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), chair of the Appropriations Committee who helped navigate the agreement through a conference committee between chambers last week.
The House voted 101-38 for House Bill 504 on Monday afternoon, and the Senate give the bill final approval a few hours later, on a 34-13 vote.
The final product struck a balance between the plan put forth by Gov. Wes Moore (D) in January, when the state was in the first throes of its fight to close a $3 billion budget gap for fiscal 2026, and a less-severe package proposed by House.
One major part of the agreement Monday deals with the implementation of “collaborative time,” which provides teachers more out-of-classroom time to plan and work with each other on various subjects and also assess student achievement. School systems are supposed to start implementing collaborative time next year.
House, Senate ratify budget compromise on final day

The Moore administration had proposed a four-year delay in the start of collaborative time, both for the savings and for practical reasons. State school leaders have said that to fully implement collaborative time, the state would need at least 12,000 teachers at a time when the state faces a teacher shortage.
The House wanted to keep next year’s implementation date. The House and Senate ultimately agreed to pause the policy requirement for collaborative time for three years, but keep the funding amount at $163 per student for next fiscal year. It would stay at that level until fiscal 2029, when it would jump to $334 per student.
Barnes said Monday evening that keeping the collaborative time funding for next fiscal year but deferring implementation should help local school leaders as they work on budgets for next school year.
Local school officials have continuously sought more flexibility in the implementation of the Blueprint, now in its third year.
Another compromise deals with the Consortium on Coordinated Community Supports, a part of the Blueprint plan that deals with mental health, behavioral and other wraparound services for students.
The governor proposed $130 million for fiscal 2026, but the House proposed cutting it to $40 million a year. The Senate held out for $70 million next year and $100 million a year thereafter, which was approved in the final bill.
Another provision dealt with community schools, which are buildings that receive concentration-of-poverty grants based on students who receive free and reduced-price meals.
One key priority the House was able to secure deals with any funds retained at a school system’s central office, money “must be used solely to support implementation at the school level.”
Paul Lemle, president of the state Maryland State Education Association, released a statement after the passage of the bill that gave it a mixed review.
“While there is a delay to increased funding dedicated for collaborative time implementation, the final bill is a significant improvement over where this conversation began in January,” Lemle said
“We were able to avoid the near-immediate, outsized cuts to expected funding for students in poverty and multilingual learners, in particular, and we protected the critical expansion of community schools and supports for students in concentrated poverty,” his statement said.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Democrats want to pursue a lawsuit challenging a state constitutional amendment that limits how much tax revenue the state can retain and spend, a Colorado-specific provision that Democrats have criticized for a long time over its restraints on the state budget.
House Joint Resolution 25-1023 would direct the Legislature’s legal arm to sue over the constitutionality of the Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights. It passed the House Finance Committee on a 7-6 vote on Monday night.
“TABOR is not sacred. The constitution is. When a state law breaks a system of government that the constitution was built to project, we have a duty to challenge it,” said resolution sponsor Rep. Sean Camacho, a Denver Democrat.

The resolution is sponsored by Camacho, Rep. Lorena Garcia of Adams County, Sen. Lindsey Daugherty of Arvada and Sen. Iman Jodeh of Aurora, all Democrats. It has over three dozen other Democrats signed on in support, including members of leadership in both chambers.
The litigation considered in the resolution would challenge TABOR in state district court on the basis that it limits Colorado’s functioning as a republican form of government as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution.
“Can a state call itself a republican form of government if its elected representatives of the people are constitutionally barred from governing?” Camacho said. “Under TABOR, this legislature is prohibited from making critical fiscal policies … without launching a costly campaign, raising money and rolling the dice in an election cycle.”
A 2011 constitutional challenge to TABOR was dismissed in 2021 in federal court on technical grounds because the court determined the lawsuit had the wrong plaintiffs. Sponsors say the resolution would allow the courts to finally settle the question.
“The courts could come back and say TABOR is 100% constitutional and that would be fine too. But I think we have an obligation to figure out whether or not it is,” Camacho said.
More fiscal flexibility
Colorado voters approved TABOR in 1992. Broadly, it sets an annual cap on state spending determined by population and inflation. If the state collects more revenue than that cap, it must refund the money to taxpayers through a variety of mechanisms, such as temporary income tax reduction or flat check sent to taxpayers.
A recent forecast from the nonpartisan Legislative Council Staff predicts that the state will collect about $618 million over the cap set by TABOR in the 2026 fiscal year.
TABOR also requires voter approval for tax increases in the state. In 2023, for example, voters rejected a proposition that would have let the state keep more money than allowed under TABOR in order to fund a property tax rate cut.
But as the cost of some state programs, such as Medicaid, grow faster than consumer inflation, TABOR limits how much the state has left over to pay for non-mandatory programs. Democrats say it’s partially why the state faced a $1.2 billion budget hole this year, which will likely be filled by an array of program repeals and agency cuts.
“The point of this is to be able to have a more flexible fiscal policy in this state that allows us to be responsive to the needs of the community,” Garcia said. “That doesn’t mean extraction of more taxes, but it would mean being flexible with how we use the revenue we have.”
Rep. Bob Marshall, a Highlands Ranch Democrat, during the committee hearing questioned whether allowing a lawsuit would open up every citizen-referred initiative to litigation, such as the recently approved constitutional amendment to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution and another measure directing lawmakers to spend $350 million on law enforcement and public safety. Witnesses responded that court cases all stand on their own, so there wouldn’t be such unintended consequences.
People representing educational associations, health care organizations, left-leaning economic groups, former lawmakers and lawyers from the previous TABOR challenge case testified in support of the resolution. They repeatedly pointed out the unique nature of TABOR in Colorado, as no other state has such a system.
“Although TABOR has had decades of significant negative impacts on Colorado’s finances, similar proposals have surfaced in other states in the past decade. However, not one of those proposals was approved,” said Maggie Gómez, the Colorado state director for the State Innovation Exchange.”It’s obvious that other states don’t believe TABOR is a risk worth taking.”
The opposition primarily comprised individual citizens who argued that TABOR set limits on a growing government and allows voters to have a say in state spending.
“TABOR ensures government lives within its means and gives people the final say on tax increases,” said Hope Scheppelman, the former vice chair of the state’s Republican Party.
Republicans will likely uniformly oppose the resolution. It needs a simple majority in both chambers to pass. Democrats control strong majorities in the state House and Senate.
“TABOR is the protection of the taxpayer. When the government overtaxes you, they have to return the money back to your pocket,” said Rep. Ron Weinberg, a Loveland Republican. “This bill looks to overrun and override a basic transparency between government and the taxpayer.”
The resolution now heads to the full House for consideration.

Brian J. Feldman (D-Montgomery) on the floor of the Senate Monday, the last day of the 2025 General Assembly session. (Photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The General Assembly’s energy package didn’t quite come down to the wire, but it was close.
With about 10 hours remaining in the 90-day legislative session, lawmakers gave final passage to a trio of energy reform bills focused on increasing the state’s power generation and curbing electricity and gas rate increases with new regulations for utilities.
The measures, backed by House and Senate leaders, come amid rising electricity costs for Marylanders. Senate President Bill Ferguson (D-Baltimore City) said Monday he is “very confident” that Gov. Wes Moore (D) will sign the bills.
“It’s probably the biggest investment in the energy marketplace here in Maryland to protect ratepayers — to protect Marylanders — in probably a decade or so,” Ferguson said after the bills cleared their final hurdle.
Republican senators renewed arguments that the legislation doesn’t do enough to lower bills — or encourage new gas-powered generation.
“We were tasked with something this year,” said Sen. Stephen S. Hershey (R- Upper Shore). “The General Assembly fell woefully short in trying to protect Maryland ratepayers.”
One part of the package is the “Legislative Energy Relief Refund,” which will send the average Maryland household about $80 worth of refunds next year, with one payment in the summer and another in the winter. The size of the refund will depend on a customer’s energy use.
House, Senate ratify budget compromise on final day

Hershey called the two $40 rebates “paltry,” and argued that they represent “overpayments from the policies that we created.”
The money is coming from “alternative compliance payments” made by utilities in lieu of complying with the state’s renewable energy laws, money that typically goes to energy efficiency projects like lighting upgrades or solar panel installation.
The cornerstone bill of the package, the Next Generation Energy Act (HB1035/SB937), began with a focus on increasing energy generation in the state. It eventually became the vehicle for a number of provisions lifted from other energy bills, however, including canceling renewable energy subsidies for trash incineration, requiring utilities to justify spending on new natural gas pipelines and a state procurement process for new nuclear energy.
The final version of the bill also incorporated House amendments to require that utilities demonstrate “customer benefits” in order to earn a multiyear rate plan, which lets companies set rate increases for several years at once. The Senate had simply required that the plan be in the public interest.
“These groundbreaking changes to utility regulation are a massive victory for all Marylanders,” said Emily Scarr, senior adviser at Maryland PIRG. “By reining in wasteful spending by BGE and other Maryland utilities, these new consumer protections will save Marylanders hundreds of millions of dollars.”
Other bills in the package created uniform standards for solar energy projects (HB1036/SB931) which proved controversial with Republicans, and established a state office focused on energy planning (HB1037/SB909)
Some environmental and ratepayer advocacy groups applauded passage of the package Monday.
In a news release Monday, Brittany Baker, Maryland director of the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, said the finalized Next Generation bill “is significantly improved from the bill as introduced.”
CCAN and other environmental groups had originally opposed the Next Generation bill, amid fears that its “fast track” for new Maryland-generated power would grease the skids for natural gas burning power plants instead of renewable energy. Baker said the final bill “gives new gas next to nothing while giving battery storage specific, time-bound financial support.”
The bill sets a goal of 150 megawatts of battery storage, and requires utilities to submit plans for reaching their share of that goal.
The package does include an expedited permitting process for up to 10 “dispatchable” energy projects, which must meet certain criteria for dispatching energy to the grid when called upon, and must have a lower greenhouse gas profile than coal or oil. The bill requires that zero-emissions projects get the fast track over others at a ratio of 4-to-1.

Hershey argued Monday that the bill should have taken further steps to incentivize gas plants.
“Did we go far enough to really incentivize somebody to come in and make that investment? And a number of us are hearing: No, we really didn’t. We might have expedited the process, but we really didn’t,” Hershey said.
House amendments also sought to address concerns from environmental groups about loosened power plant permitting requirements. Environmental groups had expressed particular concerns about the bill shortening a preapplication period to 45 days, during which the new facility’s operator notifies the surrounding community before it files an application with the Public Service Commission to build the power facility.
Under the amended bill, if the power project is bound for an “overburdened and underserved” community, the preapplication period will be 90 days. Susan Miller, a senior attorney with Earthjustice, said she believes the 90-day rule should apply no matter what.
“All Marylanders deserve the same procedural protections, particularly when the Commission will be considering projects which will pollute their neighborhoods for the next 30 years or more,” Miller said in a statement.
GOP senators took issue with changes to the bill that they argue opens the door for data centers and other commercial facilities to secure one-on-one agreements for energy that are harmful to ratepayers. Unlike the Senate bill, the House bill allowed those contracts. But it stated that if they shift extra costs “inappropriately” onto ratepayers, regulators can compel the commercial customer to pay it back.
“The largest provider of electricity in the state now is subject to being …  able to go to one customer, one private-sector customer, and say: ‘We’re going to sell directly to you.’ Isn’t that a concern for ratepayers?” Hershey asked.
Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) said the direct-power agreements are “not monolithic,” and the new provisions would give more flexibility to the Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities.
“This is seeking to find more of a middle ground and some flexibility, but with the guardrails that are there,” Augustine said. “But you’re absolutely right: There have been concerns about taking off baseload power from our grid.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DSC_0102-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-08 00:01:52.490954

Sears/Maryland Matters)Passing a budget took longer than usual this year. This time, however, it was ongoing federal budget cuts and a congressional debate over spending that dragged on and had fiscal leaders making corrections in real time.
The House and then the Senate on Monday ratified a conference committee agreement on a $67 billion overall spending plan for fiscal 2026 over the objections of Republican members, who could do little to stop the package.
The plan includes what supporters frame as budget cuts — holding vacant positions open and shifting costs to the counties plus other moves — and $1.6 billion in new taxes and fees, including two new high-income tax brackets and a new 3% sales tax on IT and data services.
“From the poor to the middle class, to the upper middle class,” Minority Leader Del Jason C. Buckel (R-Allegany) said. “I’m telling you that at the end of the day, this will be one of the worst votes that almost any of you will ever have taken – but we’re going to do it anyway.”
The House passed the budget 101-39, and the companion reconciliation bill, which contains the tax increases, 94-46.
The Senate followed the House, passing both bills by votes of 33-14 and 29-18, respectively.
All votes fell mostly, if not entirely, along party lines.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLESenate Budget and Taxation Chair Guy Guzzone (D-Howard) said that the budget agreement “puts Maryland in a strong fiscal position in the face of the challenges ahead, protecting our shared values and priorities.”
But Senate Minority Whip Justin Ready (R-Frederick and Carroll) said there was a “difference of viewpoint” in how the state should handle taxpayer money.
“There’s a difference of viewpoint here … between the idea that people give us their money, and we’re supposed to try to be good stewards of it,” Ready said, “And then there’s this attitude of … where the money is really, the government’s, and we’re going to decide how much we’re going to let people keep and how much you’re going to have.”
The overall budget for fiscal 2026 is just over 1% larger than the current year’s. The general fund budget — the portion for which the state directly taxes Maryland residents — is about $400 million smaller.
Even so, the Democratic supermajority passed a spending plan that included $1.6 billion in taxes and fees.
In addition to two new higher income tax brackets, there is some small tax relief. Lawmakers said 92% of taxpayers will see a refund or at least no increase in their income taxes.
“We’ve got to make sure we are reforming the tax code and not on the backs of middle-class families,” Gov. Wes Moore (D) told reporters Monday afternoon. “I want middle-class families to get a tax cut. Period and full stop. Anything that was not going to adjust on that was not going to be acceptable.”
For those who see a tax break, it will run between $50 and $65 on average.
Moore’s plan, as proposed in January, included a plan that promised to cut or at least not increase taxes for 60% of Marylanders. The average tax break on that plan was about $173.
The governor has not said if the final plan passed by lawmakers provides the breathing room for which he hoped.
Democrats praised the budget for resolving a projected $3 billion structural budget deficit for fiscal 2026. The plan is also said to have reduced a similar sized fiscal 2027 structural deficit to a manageable $300 million.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_5221-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 23:00:57.736477

Shoshana Chatfield, the U.S. representative to NATO’s Military Committee, was fired over the weekend, the Associated Press reported Monday.
Chatfield served as president of the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island, from 2019 to 2023 and was the first woman to lead the college. Her promotion from rear admiral to vice admiral and assignment to NATO in Brussels, Belgium, had been held up for most of 2023 by Alabama’s Republican U.S. in protest of the Pentagon’s abortion policy.
The Pentagon did not confirm that Chatfield had been relieved of her duties. Her firing was first reported by Reuters, which confirmed that allies had been notified that Chatfield had been removed from her job.
Chatfield is the third top female officer to be fired since President Donald Trump took office amid a push to erase DEI programs and online content. Trump fired Coast Guard Commandant Adm. Linda Fagan the day after he was sworn in. In February, Department of Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth announced he was firing the chief of naval operations, Adm. Lisa Franchetti.
“I want to see members of this team offer each other respect for differences, for diversity, for the dialogue from which ideas and collaboration emerge,” Chatfield told staff and faculty when she arrived at the War College in August 2019. “I want to see academic excellence. I want to see integrity in academics and in research.”
In a post on X, Sen. Mark Warner, a Democrat from Virginia, said he was “deeply disturbed” by the firing of Chatfield, who is a combat veteran and helicopter pilot.
“Trump’s relentless attacks on our alliances and his careless dismissal of decorated military officials make us less safe and weaken our position across the world,” Warner said.
The War College has removed a “small amount” of online content after conducting a review to comply with the Digital Content Refresh memorandum sent out by Assistant to the Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Sean Parnell, said Lt. Cmdr. Pete Pagano, the college’s public affairs officer.
“Examples include social media posts about DoD monthly observances and videos of lectures focused on immutable characteristics such as race, ethnicity or sex,” Pagano said in an email. “None of the affected content was part of or related to our core curriculum.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch) U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said he’s proud of Utah’s push to eliminate fluoride from drinking water, telling reporters he hopes other states follow suit. 
Kennedy spoke to a crowded room of journalists, lawmakers and health officials on Monday, part of a tour of Western states to promote his “Make America Healthy Again” agenda, known as MAHA. 
“If we want to be a moral nation, if we want to maintain our moral authority around the world, our chief obligation is to our children. And we’re letting them down. And I’m very, very happy that Utah is taking the lead in so many ways,” Kennedy said on Monday. “It makes no sense to have fluoride in our water. The evidence against fluoride is overwhelming … we know that it causes I.Q. loss.”

(Kyle Dunphey/Utah News Dispatch)
Fluoride is a mineral that has been shown to strengthen teeth by replacing minerals that are lost from acid breakdown, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A recent report from the National Toxicology Program found that high levels of fluoride in drinking water can be associated with a lower I.Q. in children — but according to the report, those levels are twice as high as the current recommended amount of fluoride. 
Kennedy spoke to several bills that align with the MAHA agenda, mostly focusing on HB81, the fluoride bill. Sponsored by Rep. Stephanie Gricius, R-Eagle Mountain, the bill prohibits municipalities from adding fluoride to drinking water, while adding it to the list of drugs that pharmacists can prescribe. 
Utah House Speaker Mike Schultz said that’s a “win-win” situation. 
“We want to make sure those options are there” for Utahns who want more fluoride than what’s available in toothpaste or mouthwash, said Schultz, R-Hooper, who spoke during Monday’s press conference. 
The bill received pushback from dentists and other health professionals, who say adding fluoride to drinking water has resulted in less cavities among children. That includes Dr. Sarah Woolsey, a family physician who told lawmakers during a legislative committee meeting that she saw a decrease in referrals for cavity extractions under anesthesia after Salt Lake County started to add fluoride to its water.
“Despite my efforts in education, in prescribing fluoride and working with parents, the voluntary application does not always work for those that may be most vulnerable,” said Woolsey. “And I would like to say that since fluoride has been in the water, the number of kids I send (to have teeth extracted) is significantly less.” 
The bill passed mostly along party lines, with a handful of Republicans joining Democrats in opposition. It was signed by the governor on March 27, and takes effect on May 7.

After the press conference on Monday, Kennedy told the Associated Press he will instruct the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to stop recommending state and local governments add fluoride to drinking water. He also told the Associated Press he will set up a task force to look into the issue. 
Lee Zeldin, a former GOP congressman and the current head of the Environmental Protection Agency, said the agency is going to review all the fluoride-related studies that came out since the National Toxicology Program report in 2024.     
“We’re prepared to act based on this science,” said Zeldin, who also spoke during the event on Monday. “Both the National Toxicology Program study, as well as other peer-reviewed studies. If this is as important as it is to Secretary Kennedy, if it’s important as it is, clearly to so many people who are here in this room and at this press conference today, then it is top of the list for the Environmental Protection Agency.”

Kennedy suggested Gricius’ bill could be a model for other states. 
“I’m very, very proud of this state for being the first state to ban (fluoride). I hope many more will come,” he said on Monday, echoing the argument from Utah lawmakers this session — that it’s an issue of bodily autonomy and freedom of choice.
“We shouldn’t be demanding that parents accept something in their children and homes that is essentially a medication. They can go to a drug store and get toothpaste,” Kennedy said. “I think it’s a moral imperative that we all believe in freedom of choice in this country, it’s one of the bedrock principles of our democracy.” 
Utah becomes the first state to ban adding fluoride to drinking water

Kennedy also touted two other bills passed by the legislature and signed by the governor. 
HB402, sponsored by Rep. Kristen Chevrier, R-Highland, bans public schools from using certain food dyes and other preservatives and additives — including potassium bromate and propylparaben — in food preparation. 
And HB403, also sponsored by Chevrier, restricts Utahns who receive benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP — a federal program that subsidizes food purchases for low-income individuals — from buying soda. 
“We anticipate that this is the beginning of a cultural shift that will extend throughout the nation, a shift towards proactively building health rather than treating disease,” said Chevrier during the news conference Monday. 
Kennedy, former presidential candidate, environmental attorney, son of former U.S. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and nephew of former president John F. Kennedy, was nominated to lead the country’s Department of Health and Human Services under President Donald Trump. 
Kennedy has long promoted public health reform, healthy diets and alternative treatments to chronic diseases — some of his stances have been controversial, including skepticism around certain vaccines, advocating against fluoride in drinking water, and claims that COVID-19 impacts certain ethnic groups differently.

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)The Alaska Permanent Fund, the No. 1 source of general-purpose revenue for state services and the Permanent Fund dividend, suffered a multibillion-dollar loss during last week’s stock market crash.
According to preliminary figures published by the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., which manages the fund, the fund’s assets declined from $81.7 billion on Tuesday to $79.7 billion at the end of the day on Friday. Figures for Monday were not immediately available.
From Wednesday through Friday, the S&P 500, a leading American stock market, declined 10.5% as markets reacted to President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs on most imported goods.
Paulyn Swanson, a spokesperson for the Alaska Permanent Fund Corp., said the Permanent Fund’s value declined by 2.7% during the same period.
Speaking last Thursday, APFC executive director Deven Mitchell noted that the fund is invested in a variety of assets, including real estate, bonds, private equity and gold, as well as publicly traded stocks. 
That means the Permanent Fund hasn’t performed as well as the S&P 500 in recent years, but during a downturn, it doesn’t suffer as much.
“In our public equity portfolio, we’ve had a tilt away from growth stocks and the S&P 500, which we’ve suffered under over the last two years, but now we’re benefiting from that tilt towards value. So in some ways … we’ll be making up ground relative to our benchmark,” he said, referring to a mix of investments that the corporation measures its performance against.
Since 2018, an annual transfer from the Permanent Fund to the state treasury has been largest source of general-purpose revenue for services and the dividend.
In the fiscal year that starts July 1, that transfer will be worth $3.9 billion. All of the state’s oil revenue combined is expected to be worth less than half that — $1.6 billion.
For the moment, money for the transfer is kept in the earnings reserve, a spendable account within the fund. As of Feb. 28, Swanson said, the earnings reserve contained $9.8 billion — enough for the upcoming transfer, an inflation-proofing payment, and part of the upcoming fiscal year 2027.
At that time, the earnings reserve also held $1.8 billion in unrealized gains — much of which may have been lost in the market slide.

The 2025 wildfire season is off to an early start in Alaska's coastal region. (Bureau of Land Management photo)The record-low snow conditions south of the Alaska Range have had big impacts across the state, especially around wildfire potential. In early March, the Iditarod had to move the race to the northern route, while the Alaska Division of Forestry & Fire Protection, or DOF, declared an early wildland fire season in its Coastal Region, requiring burn permits starting March 17 instead of the usual April 1. This region includes Southeast, Southcentral and Southwest Alaska. Find a map of the area here.
Even before the DOF order took effect or Jessie Holmes’s dog team crossed the finish line in Nome, two fires had already spread in the snow-free grasses of the Kenai Peninsula and Mat-Su Valley, confirming the early fire danger in Alaska’s most populous areas. The risk of human-caused fires has become evident, with at least 17 requiring a response as of April 4. Most were the result of negligent burning, emphasizing the critical importance of ensuring that burn piles are monitored, keeping fire tools on hand, and never leaving a fire unattended. 
While local, state, and federal fire managers prepare for an already active fire season, it is critical that Alaskans exercise caution with anything that could ignite a fire. We encourage homeowners to reduce wildfire hazards around your home by following Firewise principals.
Burning yard waste in a pile or barrel is a common spring chore for many homeowners, and in these extreme conditions, it is important to follow safe burning practices as outlined on the DOF Learn Before You Burn website https://dnr.alaska.gov/burn/ and on burn permits. Unsafe burning is a major contributor to wildfires, especially this time of year because dry, dead vegetation is exposed to the sun, creating a landscape primed for ignition that could quickly spread and endanger lives and property.
For an even safer option, consider disposing of yard waste at designated woody debris disposal sites operated by local municipalities, boroughs or state DOF offices. You can find a web app showing the disposal sites in Alaska here. 
As we head into spring, Alaskans should take extra precautions:

Be mindful when recreating on dry, exposed vegetation — one spark from an ATV, snowmachine, or chainsaw can start a fire.
Follow all burn permit requirements and restrictions. Do not burn on a windy day. If conditions continue to deteriorate, burn suspensions or closures may be necessary to protect lives and property.
If you see smoke or fire, report it immediately by calling 911 or 1-800-237-3633. Early detection can mean the difference between a small fire and a large-scale emergency.
Stay informed through information from your local government fire departments, emergency services, and wildland fire agencies through social media and online sources such as the Alaska Wildland Fire Information — akfireinfo.com — or the Alaska Interagency Coordination Center website. 

Years like this one, where the snow melts early, are more likely to result in above-average fire seasons, according to new research from the University of Alaska Fairbanks. While early snow-off does not guarantee a big season, Alaska’s spring  snowmelt now occurs nearly two weeks earlier than it did in the 1990s, contributing to long-term wildfire trends. Both tundra and boreal forest regions are experiencing larger, more frequent fires, with statewide impacts. 
The new Alaska’s Changing Wildfire Environment report summarizes what is known about how wildland fire in Alaska is changing. The report was compiled by the UAF Alaska Fire Science Consortium, with contributions from the Alaska wildfire management community.
By staying informed and taking precautions now, Alaskans can help reduce the risk of dangerous wildfires. Just as mushers adapt to unpredictable trail conditions, we must also adjust to Alaska’s changing fire landscape. The same lack of snow that forced the Iditarod north is fueling early fire activity in the south. While the Iditarod’s route may shift year to year, our responsibility to prevent wildfires remains constant.

(YouTube | Office of the Special Counsel)Former Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who led a widely derided review of the 2020 presidential election,  searching for evidence for baseless accusations of fraud, will have his law license suspended for three years, according to a stipulated agreement between him and the state Office of Lawyer Regulation (OLR). 
Law Forward, the progressive voting rights focused firm, filed a grievance against Gableman with the OLR in 2023. The OLR filed a complaint against Gableman in November that alleged, among other counts, that he had failed to “provide competent representation” and to “abstain from all offensive personality” and of violating attorney-client privilege.
The allegations against Gableman stemmed from his treatment of the mayors of Green Bay and Madison, whom he threatened with jail time during his review, false statements he made during testimony to legislative committees, violating the state’s open records laws, breaching his contract with Assembly Speaker Robin Vos and, when OLR began investigating him, “making false statements” to the investigators in an affidavit. 
As part of the stipulated agreement, Gableman admitted that “he cannot successfully defend against the allegations of misconduct … and agrees that the allegations of the complaint provide an adequate factual basis in the record.” 
In a statement, Law Forward’s general counsel Jeff Mandel said that Gableman’s actions “were and continue to be a threat to our democracy and the rule of law.” 
“Our justice system can work only if everyone plays by the rules,” Mandell said. “Two years and one month after Law Forward first filed a grievance with the Office of Lawyer Regulation explaining how Gableman’s unethical behavior did lasting damage to the public’s faith in elections, we are glad to see consequences for those who plan and promote overturning the will of the people.”
“Gableman violated his sworn duty to uphold both the U.S. and the Wisconsin constitutions and his obligations as an attorney,” Mandell continued. “He broke more rules than he followed, acting with complete indifference to election law, procedural norms, and the ethical obligations that bind attorneys. With this deal, Gableman stipulates that he misled courts, lied in public meetings, and violated government transparency laws.”",https://wisconsinexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-15-at-2.07.50-PM-1024x501.png,,,2025-04-07 21:00:52.538877

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)The House Finance Committee stripped $1.25 million in school safety funding, saying that counties have millions of dollars in excess funds to pay for things like weapon detection systems and secure front entries. 
School leaders have told lawmakers that they don’t have $258 million needed for school safety upgrades.
While there’s been an uptick in school threats in West Virginia, a state education department report last year showed 272 schools still don’t have safe school entries — also known as mantraps — that include two interlocking doors and a control system. 
“We’ve been blessed that we haven’t had an incident, but that doesn’t mean necessarily there won’t be,” said Mickey Blackwell, executive director of the Association of Elementary and Middle School Principals. “It’s very disappointing to think that at any time we would say we need less money for children’s safety.”
The House of Delegates and Senate have proposed millions of dollars in school safety funding in their respective budgets for fiscal year 2026, and the budget bills are currently in negotiations as the Legislature winds down in its final week.
The House Committee on Finance Monday morning removed an appropriation of $1.25 million in House Bill 3369 that was for school safety measures and to be used by the end of the current fiscal year, according to the original measure. The funding was requested by Gov. Patrick Morrisey. 
  Del. Clay Riley, R-Harrison
Del. Clay Riley, vice chairman of the committee, said lawmakers heard testimony that the county school board have unencumbered assets of $784 million. 
“Now, they need to keep some of that back for reserve, but I don’t think this modification … will impact the ability to provide safe schools. There’s money in the county, and therefore I’m going to support it,” said Riley, R-Harrison. 
Del. Joe Statler, R-Monongalia, said counties keep asking lawmakers for additional funds instead of taking care of their safety upgrades.
“I wanted it to be noted that if you look, they’ve got some pretty healthy war chests in some of these counties that could be addressing some of these safety concerns,” he said. “I just want that to be known out there that this is something that needs to be addressed.”
School finances are in trouble due to the state’s declining population and students exiting public schools to use the state’s education voucher program, the Hope Scholarship. Counties’ financial contributions to schools — levies, taxes and more — haven’t been able to cover the bulk of safety needs.
The state school board declined to comment.
A spokesperson for Morrisey told West Virginia Watch, “Budget negotiations are ongoing and Gov. Morrisey is ready to work with the House and Senate to pass a balanced budget that funds his priorities and supports the needs of West Virginians.”
Dale Lee, president of the West Virginia Education Association, said the number of school Reduction in Force notifications across the state show that counties don’t have excess funds. 
“Many of our counties face financial difficulties,” he said. “There may be a few counties that have some money for that, but I would venture to say a large majority of our counties don’t have the funds to sustain … You can’t put a price on our student safety.”
Blackwell added, “I’ve never heard anyone say that, ‘We have extra money to waste on school safety.’ Most of our counties are working very hard to break even.”
The bill now only appropriates nearly $600,000 in a surplus fund that counties or charter schools could access should student enrollment exceed estimates. 
Lawmakers are advancing other measures aimed at school safety, like House Bill 2164, sponsored by Statler, that would allow public and charter schools, along with private and religious schools, to employ school safety officers. The SSOs must be former law enforcement officers and may carry firearms; they could detain but not arrest a suspect, according to the legislation. 
Some researchers have said that an investment in student support services, including counselors and social workers, is what will ultimately increase school safety. A measure, House Bill 3209, also sponsored by Statler, would require counties to employ at least one school counselor for every 250-300 students in elementary school and 400-450 students in high schools. 
House Bill 2187, which would have allowed public school teachers to carry concealed firearms, remains parked in the House Judiciary Committee. The legislation was meant to bolster school safety.

Free.,"Supreme Court permits Trump to use wartime law for deportations, for now and with limits",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/supreme-court-permits-trump-use-wartime-law-deportations-now-and-limits,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court Monday said the Trump administration could continue for now to use the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to carry out rapid deportations of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members — but they must be given a chance to challenge their deportations in court.The 5-4 decision, which lifted a temporary restraining order by a District of Columbia federal judge, will allow the Trump administration to deport Venezuelans 14 and older who are suspected of Tren de Aragua gang ties, in a victory for the administration of President Donald Trump.But those immigrants who are subject to the wartime law must have ""reasonable notice” in order to challenge their deportation in court “before such removal occurs,” according to the order. The question is which court.The order argues that the venue of the U.S. District Court of the District of Columbia is wrong, and that the challenge, which was originally brought by five men in Texas, should be made in the Lone Star State. The challenge is no longer brought by five men and is now a class action.“The detainees seek equitable relief against the implementation of the Proclamation and against their removal under the (Alien Enemies Act),” according to the Supreme Court. “They challenge the Government’s interpretation of the Act and assert that they do not fall within the category of removable alien enemies. But we do not reach those arguments.”The president praised the decision, which did not address the merits of the actual law, on social media.“The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself,” Trump wrote. “A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!”Dissenting justicesThe three liberal justices dissented: Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. The fourth dissent, in part, came from Amy Coney Barrett, who is considered a member of the court’s six-justice conservative majority.“The Court’s legal conclusion is suspect,” Sotomayor wrote in her dissent.She added that the majority opinion did not note the harm that could come to the Venezuelans who could face deportation under the Alien Enemies Act. Already, 238 men have been subject to the proclamation and are currently in a brutal mega-prison in El Salvador, the Terrorist Confinement Center  or CECOT.“It does so without mention of the grave harm Plaintiffs will face if they are erroneously removed to El Salvador or regard for the Government’s attempts to subvert the judicial process throughout this litigation,” she said. “Because the Court should not reward the Government’s efforts to erode the rule of law with discretionary equitable relief, I respectfully dissent.”There is a preliminary injunction hearing against the Trump administration’s use of the Alien Enemies Act Tuesday at 3 p.m. Eastern before U.S. District Court Judge James E. Boasberg. That hearing deals with the administration’s use of the law.This was the second decision from the high court Monday that sided with the Trump administration.Earlier, Chief Justice John Roberts decided to temporarily pause a lower court’s order to require the Trump administration to return to the United States a Maryland man wrongly deported to a prison in El Salvador.Appeal to the high courtThe Trump administration March 28 appealed to the Supreme Court after an appeals court declined to do away with the temporary restraining order placed by Boasberg.Boasberg had extended his temporary restraining order until April 12 to prevent any more deportations of Venezuelan nationals, invoked by Trump with a presidential proclamation on March 14.The American Civil Liberties Union brought the suit against the Trump administration’s use of the wartime law. The legal organization asked the Supreme Court to keep the temporary restraining order in place because “it is becoming increasingly clear that many (perhaps most) of the men” who were on the March 15 deportation flights to the prison in El Salvador “were not actually members of” the Tren de Aragua and were “erroneously listed” due to their tattoos.The same day that Boasberg issued his restraining order, on March 15, three deportation flights landed in El Salvador, where 261 men were taken to the mega-prison.Boasberg has vowed to determine if the Trump administration violated his restraining order by asking for flight details but the Department of Justice has invoked the so-called “state secrets privilege"" to block any information.",,,,2025-04-07 21:00:52.538877

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)For the 21 members of the Senate who voted against House Bill 655, Sen. Theresa Manzella had a very specific message.
“To those of you who are in opposition to it, I’m sorry,” Manzella, a Republican from Hamilton said. “I wish you knew the Jesus Christ that I know, because he would never abandon, or abuse, or hurt children.”
At the heart of a fiery debate on Monday was whether the state’s foster care system discounts families with strong religious beliefs. However, other lawmakers worried that foisting strong or different religious beliefs on foster children could create more trauma or instability.
The bill was brought by Rep. Greg Oblander, R-Billings, and carried by Manzella, and it seeks to change laws regarding foster care and adoption services. The bill passed a second reading, 29-21. The legislation’s stated intention is “prohibiting discriminatory action” to potential foster parents or those interested in adoption.
Proponents of the bill said it would open up more opportunities for children to be fostered or adopted, and the Montana Family Foundation testified some state-sponsored training for foster parents did not fit into some people’s religious beliefs. Opponents said it could impress religious beliefs onto adopted and foster children, with references to the country’s Native American boarding school era.
It drew lengthy and, at times, furious emotional debate. Multiple legislators — including Sens. Jonathan Windy Boy, D-Box Elder, and John Fuller, R-Kalispell — stood to speak on the bill and amendment several times.
Windy Boy, a member of the Rocky Boy’s Chippewa-Cree tribe,  stood three times on the bill itself after speaking during an amendment. Senate Majority Leader Tom McGillvary, R-Billings, shut Windy Boy down when he tried to speak on the floor for a third time. Senate rules allowed two opportunities to stand and speak on an item.
“I’m not going to apologize for standing more than twice,” Windy Boy had said moments prior. “That’s what my constituents sent me here to do.”
Windy Boy’s opposition to the bill included references to religious run boarding schools, one of the darkest periods of American history. Thousands of Indigenous children were sent to Christian-run boarding schools to be “assimilated” in white culture. More than 3,000 children died at these schools, according to a 2024 report in the Washington Post. The federal government also commissioned a report released in 2024 on boarding schools. Some of those children were sexually abused, including in Montana.
“A lot of those kids had no choices,” Windy Boy said on the floor. “The parents had no choices. But yet, at the same time, those kids were spanked, they were abused, mental abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse. Is that the kind of system that we’re going to continue pushing into this era? I should hope not.”
An amendment from Sen. Cora Neumann, D-Bozeman, sought to take some of the teeth out of the legislation, removing foster care. Neumann presented it as strictly as a reunification ideal — essentially foster children should be placed in culturally appropriate situations.
“It’s taking foster care out just to make sure that birth parents and families, that their beliefs are able to be held intact in case of reunification,” Neumann said. “I believe everyone here supports reunification of families wherever possible.”
Some Senate Republicans appeared to view both the amendment as well as some statements made on the floor to be a full-throated attack on Christianity.
“It’s very clear what’s going on here,” Fuller said. “This is a secular attempt to deny people of faith, of any kind, of being involved in the foster care system.”
Sen. Dennis Lenz said there was “an illusion” religion had a “negative impact.” 
“If your car breaks down in the middle of the inner city in the dark of the night, and you have a mile back to home and a group of 20-year-olds is coming to you out of the dark, wouldn’t it make a difference if they’re coming from the Bible study?” said Lenz, a Republican from Billings. “Most likely.”
The Senate was under “pressure” to pass the bill, Sen. Ellie Boldman, D-Missoula said on the floor. Some of that pressure was from the Montana Family Foundation, Boldman said in a text message, and one of the organization’s lobbyists, Derek Oestreicher, was seated on a bench Monday in the Senate gallery.
Oestreicher also provided testimony during the bill’s Senate Judiciary hearing. He said during the bill’s hearing that his organization had heard from religious families they would choose their faith over fostering.
“Montana Family Foundation was contacted by two separate families over the past year related to some of the required training that the state requires for foster families to undergo, and it discussed LGBTQ issues and how to address those issues,” Oestreicher said. “And these families were concerned that this was a required training, and they weren’t necessarily required to say they were an ally or that they would take a certain action with regard to LGBT issues, but it trended toward that, and it made them feel very uncomfortable.”
Sen. Carl Glimm, R-Kila, said he supported the bill and that it was “academic” for him having gone through the process, though it wasn’t clear if he meant fostering or adoption.
But he then went on to say for him, there was no prejudice against his Lutheran faith.
“I’ve done it,” Glimm said, “In my process, I wasn’t discriminated against for my religious views.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BibleStockPhoto-1024x784.jpg,,,2025-04-07 21:00:52.538877

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch) Senators sent legislation on Iowa’s elections to Gov. Kim Reynolds’ desk Monday that included provisions on verifying Iowa voters’ citizenship status.
The Senate also passed bills addressing the governor’s math instruction proposal, vaccines for a sexually transmitted virus, fireworks and the minimum age for firearm possession.
House File 954, passed 32-15, was a bill proposed by Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate that would allow the Secretary of State’s office to contract with federal and state agencies, and with private entities, for voter roll verification and maintenance.
The bill also laid out steps for setting a voter’s registration status as “unconfirmed” in cases where the state registrar or a county commissioner “has received information from a reliable source indicating that the registered voter is not qualified.” A “unconfirmed” voter’s status would be changed to “active” after they provide proof that they are qualified to vote under the legislation.
The bill also allows for a voter to be challenged at the polls over their citizenship status. A challenged voter is allowed to present precinct election officials evidence or facts to prove they are qualified to vote. If the challenge is not withdrawn after this procedure, the voter would cast a provisional ballot.

While Pate and Republican lawmakers said these measures would prevent non-U.S. citizens from illegally participating in Iowa elections, Democrats said the measure could lead to discrimination at Iowa polls. Sen. Matt Blake, D-Urbandale, said he was concerned about allowing challenges on the basis of citizenship at the polls.
He said that these challenges can be brought by third-party poll watchers, who would have the ability to challenge the qualifications of any voter they feel could potentially be a noncitizen. Curing the ballot in these cases could be more difficult than other challenges allowed at the polls to a person’s age or residence, Blake said.
“The characteristics of trying to prove citizenship at the polls is different than residency and other factors that are currently questions that can be asked,” Blake said. “You may have a driver’s license that’s updated that proves where you live. You may have your bill in the car related to that you live in a particular spot. Adding the question of whether somebody is a citizen requires a whole set of documents that — I don’t know, I don’t carry around my birth certificate.”
These changes were proposed following Pate’s guidance to county auditors ahead of the 2024 general election to challenge the ballots of of 2,176 voters identified as “potential noncitizens” based on state information. In March, Pate said of the 2,176 individuals on the list, 277 were confirmed to not be U.S. citizens, and 35 noncitizens cast ballots in Iowa that were counted in Nov. 5, 2024 election.
Blake and other Democrats said the small number of people on Pate’s list of potential noncitizens — and a smaller percentage of the overall number of Iowans who participated in the 2024 general election — showed that the measure was unnecessarily making it more difficult for Iowans to vote while raising mistrust in the state’s elections.
But Sen. Ken Rozenboom, R-Oskaloosa, the bill’s floor manager, said the fact that there were any noncitizens who participated in Iowa’s elections showed the need for the measure.
“Do you hear yourself? Do you hear yourself?” Rozenboom said. “Only 40 noncitizens voted in last year’s election in Iowa, and only 35 of those were counted. As a state that has a long history of conducting elections that provide timely voting results that are widely trusted, in order to maintain the integrity of our system, it’s important that we update our election laws as conditions and challenges change. … We’ve had elections in Iowa for congressional races decided by seven votes and legislative races, recently have been very close. This bill provides more tools for our elections officials to use to maintain that long standing tradition of integrity of Iowa’s election process.”
The bill also included a ban on ranked choice voting. Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, introduced an amendment, which failed, to allow local governments to conduct elections using ranked choice voting. The voting method, also known as instant runoff voting, has voters order candidates on a ballot from their first to last choice, with a candidate winning if they receive the majority of first-choice voters. If there is not a clear winner, the candidate with the least votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their first choice have their votes redistributed to their second choice — a process which repeats until one candidate wins the majority of votes.

The election bill was just one of several measures passed by lawmakers in the Senate on their first day of debate since the second funnel deadline. Other bills passed Monday include:

The bill is the governor’s proposal seeking to improve Iowa students’ mathematics aptitude after the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) found mathematics scores decreased for both fourth and eighth graders. The legislation would require Iowa schools to assess K-6 students’ math skills at least three times a year. If students are deemed “persistently at risk,” schools would be required to implement a personalized mathematics plan for the student, alongside other intervention strategies, to help the child reach grade-standard proficiency.
The Iowa Department of Education would also be required by the bill to develop and distribute a comprehensive mathematics plan to Iowa schools to increase math proficiency, and provide mathematics instructional aid for teachers and parents.
Reynolds released a statement Monday celebrating the bill’s passage.
“One of the greatest predictors of future success in the classroom and workplace, along with early literacy, is mathematics competency,” Reynolds said in a statement. “At an early age we need to identify children who are not yet proficient in math and ensure they receive the personalized help they need to build a strong foundation. We will support our teachers with evidence-based professional development and ensure all students receive math instruction in the way we know it works.”
 Vaccination of minors for sexually transmitted diseases: Senate File 304 would remove a current exemption in Iowa law allowing minors to consent to receive vaccinations for sexually transmitted infections, like the HPV vaccine, without their parent’s permission. Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, said the bill would prevent children from accessing a vaccination that can prevent cancers caused by human papillomavirus infections. She also said the measure does not acknowledge the fact that minors who are seeking this vaccination may be the victims of child sex abuse.
“The truth is, more children in Iowa are survivors of child sex abuse than any one of us want to believe, and oftentimes, that abuse is occurring in the very house where they’re being raised,” Petersen said. “This legislation puts these kids at an increased risk by potentially putting the decision on whether or not they can do anything to protect their body … in the hands of someone who is raping them.”
Sen. Sandy Salmon, R-Janesville, said the bill only applies to vaccinations, and does not change other sections of Iowa law that allows minors to receive medical care related to the prevention, diagnosis or treatment of sexually transmitted diseases or infections without their parents or guardians’ consent.
Fireworks: Senate File 303, a bill passed 31-16 after it was deferred by lawmakers in March, would prohibit county boards of supervisors and city councils from placing restrictions on the use of fireworks on July 3, 4 and Dec. 31 outside of existing restrictions in Iowa Code on fireworks. Local governments would still be allowed to set restrictions on fireworks for other days.
“This is a simple bill about freedom in order to ensure that Iowans will be able to truly celebrate in the grand American tradition of fireworks on our holidays,” Sen. Cherielynn Westrich, R-Ottumwa, said.
Minimum age for acquiring firearms: House File 924, sent to the governor with a 33-14 vote, lowers the minimum age for possessing and carrying a firearm, and for permitting, from age 21 to age 18. The measure still sets the age limit at 21 and older for permits to acquire a handgun.
Sen. Scott Webster, R-Bettendorf, said the bill was prompted by the U.S. Eight Circuit Court of Appeals decision that found a Minnesota law limiting firearm permits to people age 21 and older was unconstitutional. He also said he supported the measure as a way to ensure Iowans between the ages of 18 to 20 have access to their constitutional rights.
“As a father of an 18-year-old … I believe that my daughter has the constitutional right to be able to defend herself, no different than anybody else,” Webster said. “She’s 18 years old. She’s an adult, she can vote. She has that right.”

(Will Price | West Virginia Legislative Photography)With less than a week to go during the West Virginia Legislature’s regular session, a Senate committee on Monday resurrected legislation that would loosen the state’s strict school vaccination laws. 
The Senate Health Committee approved a version of House Bill 2776 that incorporates the language of Senate Bill 460 with slight changes. The House of Delegates narrowly voted down Senate Bill 460 last month. 
As it passed the House of Delegates, House Bill 2776 would have required that the state Department of Health report positive tests of Alpha-gal syndrome, an allergic condition related to tick bites, to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
HB 2776 S HHR S&I 4-7
The Senate Health Committee’s version of the bill now would add religious exemptions to the state’s vaccine requirements and allow a student’s health care provider to submit a medical exemption without needing approval from the state immunization officer, which would be eliminated under the bill. 
Sen. Joey Garcia, D-Marion, argued that the amendment is not germane to the original bill and could violate a constitutional rule that requires that bills have one subject. 
Committee Chair Laura Chapman, who had advocated for religious vaccine exemptions, ruled that the amendment is germane because the bill has to do with disease prevention and the state’s public health system.
Garcia opposed the amendment, saying that he had heard more negative opinions about Senate Bill 460 than anything else this legislative session. 
“After that 42 to 56 vote rejecting this bill in the West Virginia House of Delegates, my hope would be maybe the people around this table and the people in the Senate would take a second look,” Garcia said. “Because this is one of the most hugely unpopular and just honestly wrong things that we could be doing for the state of West Virginia.” 
Sen. Tom Takubo, R-Kanawha, a physician, also argued against the amendment, with comments about a growing measles outbreak in Texas that has so far been linked to the deaths of two children, and other preventable illnesses. 
“There’s an adage in medicine, ‘First, do no harm.’ There’s so much in today’s world that these kids have to worry about. Dying and struggling from these completely preventable childhood diseases shouldn’t be one of them,” Takubo said. “This Legislature is dead set on putting our kids in harm’s way. 
“If we do what this bill is trying to do, we’re going to go from one of the best [vaccinated] to one of the worst in just a matter of years,” he said. “We’re the worst vaccinated state in the country until it’s time to go to school. Then we become one of the best.”
Under the new version of the bill, parents and guardians or emancipated students could annually submit a notarized statement to their school or child care center administrator on a form created by the state department of health that says the person holds a religious belief that is opposed to vaccination and that they have reviewed information about vaccinations provided by the department. There’s also an exemption for full-time virtual students. 
Schools would be required to create and maintain reports including the number and percentage of students granted exemptions. 
The bill, in its current version, would not allow the state’s religious and private schools to set their own policies for vaccination requirements.  
All states require students to be vaccinated for a series of infectious diseases including measles, polio and chickenpox. Until this year, West Virginia was among five states that did not allow exemptions to those requirements based on religious or philosophical beliefs. The state’s laws have only allowed medical exemptions, which have required the approval of the state’s immunization officer. 
Gov. Patrick Morrisey issued an executive order in January requiring the state to allow religious exemptions on his second day in office. 
According to the state Department of Health, the state approved 186 religious exemptions in the approximately two months after Morrisey’s executive order. 
The bill will next go to the full Senate for three readings and then a vote. The House of Delegates would next have to sign off on the bill, a version of which it’s already voted down. The regular session of the Legislature ends Saturday at midnight.

[&#8230;]","The Missouri Capitol in Jefferson City (Tessa Weinberg/Missouri Independent).The Missouri Senate approved a proposed tax cut Monday despite questions about whether official estimates truly reflect how much it would reduce state revenue.
By a 27-6 vote, with the 10 Democrats evenly split and all but one Republican in favor, the bill now heads back to the House, where its sponsor, Republican state Rep. Chad Perkins of Bowling Green, intends to bring it to a final vote.
Earlier in the afternoon, the cost estimate for the bill exempting long-term capital gains — profits from property held more than a year — was approved by a party-line vote in the Senate Fiscal Oversight Committee.
The bill would also increase income limits and credit amounts for the property tax relief program known as “circuit breaker” as well as exempt diapers and feminine hygiene products from sales tax. Overall, the fiscal note for the bill states it is expected to reduce state revenue by almost $430 million in the fiscal year that starts July 1 and about $350 million annually thereafter.
Democrats who voted against the bill said they were concerned about estimates from a left-leaning Washington tax institute, reported by The Independent, that the capital gains cut could reduce state general revenue by $600 million or more compared to the official estimate of $111 million.
Missouri lawmakers set to pass capital gains tax cut with questions about its total cost

The committee vote came after Democrats peppered state Department of Revenue economist Jean Hancock with questions about the wide difference in the estimates.
“My question would be how can we be off by half a billion dollars?” Senate Democratic Leader Doug Beck of Affton asked.
The institute’s estimate is based on IRS data from 2022 that showed $13.3 billion in long-term capital gains reported on returns from Missouri. Using the state’s top tax rate of 4.7%, applied to taxable income more than $8,911, the institute estimated the revenue from that much income would be about $625 million.
That is simple math that does not account for the other elements of Missouri’s tax code, Hancock told the committee.
“We actually pull every single person’s return in our model, and we run them and we pull out exactly what was claimed,” Hancock said.”So that’s where our numbers come from. Whoever has something else. I don’t know where they get them.”
In an interview after the hearing, Hancock said there are a number of deductions allowed in Missouri law that reduce income below the amounts reported on federal returns. All income from Social Security payments and much of the income from pension benefits is not taxed, she noted, and many high-income earners purchase tax credits that eliminate part or all of their tax liability.
Another reason the institute’s estimate is off, Hancock argued, is because not all capital gains reported on a return from Missouri are taxable in Missouri. A capital gain for property located in another state, for example, would not result in a Missouri tax payment.
“The capital gains numbers we’re providing are the ones that we believe are accurate,” Hancock said to the committee.
Beck voted against the bill in committee and for it when it reached the floor.
Under the bill, which Gov. Mike Kehoe has said is a priority for his first year in office, the capital gains exemption would take effect immediately for individual income tax filers and after revenue triggers are met for corporate income taxes. 
The circuit breaker is a refundable tax credit allowed for lower-income people over age 65 and those with disabilities to offset property taxes for their home. It is available to people who rent and people who own their own home.
Because it is refundable, people eligible for a credit that exceeds their tax liability receive a check for the difference.
The circuit breaker changes would increase the maximum credit for renters to $1,055. For homeowners, the maximum credit would be increased to $1,550. It would also increase the income limits for claiming the credit, to $38,200 for renters and $41,000 for homeowners, with slightly higher amounts allowed for married couples claiming the credit.
With revenues falling in the current year and a budget plan that uses about $1 billion of accumulated surpluses, some Democrats are opposing all tax cuts.
“I am just very, very concerned about how we continue to reduce state revenue,” said state Sen. Maggie Nurrenbern of Kansas City, who voted against the bill, “and the impact that that’s going to have moving forward.”

Across the Ohio border, over a dozen people have contracted the highly infectious virus — including one most recently in Allen County, Ohio. Neighboring Kentucky has also reported a small number of cases.
As of April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reported a total of 607 confirmed cases in 22 jurisdictions across the United States, though the risk to the general public is low.
Because measles is so easily spread, a single case is considered an outbreak, the state health agency said. When infected people sneeze or cough, droplets spray into the air. Those droplets remain in the air and on surfaces for up to two hours.
More than 93% of people who receive a single dose of MMR will develop immunity to measles, and more than 97 percent will be protected after receiving a second dose. Two doses of the vaccine are needed to be fully protected. Individuals are encouraged to check with their healthcare providers to ensure vaccinations are up to date. Individuals born before 1957 are presumed to be immune to measles.
Children are routinely vaccinated for measles at 12-15 months, and again at 4-6 years of age before going to kindergarten. Children as young as 6 months old can receive the measles vaccine if they are at risk.
Symptoms
Measles begins with a fever, cough, runny nose and red eyes roughly seven to 14 days after exposure, though symptoms can emerge up to three weeks later. Fevers can reach up to 105 degrees but one of the earliest signs are Koplik spots, or tiny white bumps inside of the mouth.
Following that, a rash may form along the hairline and on the face before spreading down the back and torso and to the limbs. After about five days, the rash typically fades in the same order.
What you can do
The state health department urges Hoosiers experiencing symptoms to stay home and call their health provider before going to the doctor’s office. Those with the measles should stay home and away from others, especially vulnerable populations like unvaccinated infants, people who are immunocompromised and pregnant women.

Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, questions a bill that would abolish the State Library Board and the Educational Television Commission. Photographed Feb. 13, 2025. (Mary Hennigan/Arkansas Advocate)A bill that clarifies aspects of Arkansas’ public meetings law is heading to the governor’s desk after it again passed the Senate by a wide margin on Monday.
The bill specifies what members of city councils, quorum courts or school boards could discuss outside of a public meeting and would also allow a court to nullify any decisions made by a public body if it was in violation of open meetings laws.
Senate Bill 227, sponsored by Sen. Clarke Tucker, D-Little Rock, had already passed the Senate once, but the addition of co-sponsors when it was being considered in the House required another vote by the upper chamber. 
Senators voted 34-1 in favor of passage; more senators voted yes in the second vote, including Sen. Alan Clark, who voted against Tucker’s bill when it first passed the Senate last month. Clark introduced his own amendments to the state’s Freedom of Information Act that would have defined a public meeting as “more than two” members of a public body – a change from the current status quo. That bill, Senate Bill 376, has been waiting to be heard in the House State Agencies and Governmental Affairs committee, and Clark voted against Tucker’s bill the first time it went before the chamber.
Only Sen. John Payton, R-Wilburn, voted no during Monday’s vote.
The current FOIA does not define the number of people needed for a meeting to qualify as public, but has generally been interpreted to mean a meeting where at least two members of a governing body get together. Tucker’s bill, if signed into law, would make that more explicit.
Tucker’s bill has support from FOIA advocates around the state. The president of the Arkansas Press Association, Andrew Bagley, called Tucker’s bill “a very good piece of legislation” during a committee meeting March 12.
The Arkansas Freedom of Information Act gives Arkansans broad access to public records, such as emails sent between state officials and documents used in the course of government action. The law also establishes access to public meetings by members of the public, although the vague language governing this access has led to multiple instances of litigation as local governments ran afoul of the sunshine provisions.

Chris Brown, a Kansas City Republican, speaks in the House in February (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The Missouri House passed a bill Monday that would establish a fund to pay for hyperbaric oxygen therapy for veterans with a traumatic brain injury and facing post-traumatic stress disorder to help prevent suicide and opioid addiction.
The House passed the bill with a 156 to 1 vote.
“The bottom line is, there are too many veterans that are taking their lives,”  said state Rep. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City sponsoring the legislation. “They don’t see a way out. They can’t deal with it. And I think the oxygen therapy certainly will help and maybe even is the answer.”
The legislation will now head to the Senate, where lawmakers are considering a companion bill sponsored by state Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the goal of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is to get more oxygen to tissues damaged by disease, injury or other factors. Patients enter a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, where the air pressure is increased up to three times higher than normal air pressure. The lungs can gather much more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.
The bill directs the Missouri Veterans Commission to compile an annual report with data about the treatment of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and its effectiveness.
“This is a great moment that the bill made it to the Senate,” said Dale Lutzen, a retired senior master sergeant from the U.S. Air Force and a legislative advocate for the non-profit TreatNOW. 
Lutzen told lawmakers in a committee hearing in January that veterans with traumatic brain injuries or PTSD are typically given prescription drugs that treat symptoms but don’t cure the brain injury.
“As an alternative to drugs, hyperbaric oxygen therapy stimulates brain wound healing and it can reverse soft tissue and neurocognitive damage,” Lutzen said. “This treatment allows patients to experience recovery of cognitive and neurological functioning without surgery or drugs.”
Despite numerous studies that prove its efficacy, the treatment is not on Medicare’s approved list, he said, and is not covered. 
“At its most basic level, HB262 gives veterans, who have been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury or PTSD, the right to receive the treatment as prescribed by a doctor,” he said.
Lutzen has been pushing for the last four years to get the fund established, he said. Last year, the bill passed in the House but stalled in the Senate. Lutzen is hoping that Brattin’s companion legislation will be the key to getting the bill across the finish line. 
According to the bill’s fiscal analysis, the cost of reimbursing hyperbaric facilities for the necessary treatments could exceed $5 million annually. The funds will come from “any appropriations, gifts, bequests, or public or private donations,” the bill states.
State Rep. Stephanie Boykin, a Democrat from Florissant and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, spoke in support of the bill on Monday. 
“We have veterans who are suffering,” Boykin said. “We have veterans who have already tried medicines. They’ve already tried just traditional therapy. So this alternative therapy is what’s needed, and we need to be there and standing for our veterans.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Brown-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-04-07 20:06:27.350473

(Micah Drew/Daily Montanan)Despite Republican leaders’ pledge to reshape the judiciary in Montana, the Legislature doesn’t appear to have had the appetite to increase the partisanship of the state’s courts this session. 
On Monday, representatives voted down House Bill 838, a bill that would allow Montana Supreme Court candidates to indicate a political affiliation, on a 46-54 vote, with 12 Republicans joining all Democrats in repudiating the premise. 
Last week two similar bills — Senate Bill 42 and Senate Bill 543 stalled in the House and Senate respectively.
Urging his caucus to support his bill, HB 838, Speaker of the House Brandon Ler, R-Savage, said he too would like an independent judiciary, but that doesn’t happen. 
“The will of the voters was to send a strong conservative majority out here the past three sessions I’ve been in, and every good bill we run on the floor just seems to get shot down,” Ler said. “It’s time to make the judiciary reflect the will of the voters of Montana.” 
In early January, Ler along with Senate President Matt Regier, R-Kalispell, outlined a plan for reigning in the co-equal branch of government. 
A primary goal was to make judicial elections partisan. Many GOP lawmakers allege justices already have partisan leanings and the labels simply offer voters transparency. Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte echoed this desire, repeatedly calling on lawmakers to send such a bill to his desk. 
But with less than a month left in the 69th legislative session, lawmakers are 0-for-5 on passing bills aimed at removing the state’s nonpartisan elections for judges. 
Several adjacent bills — one to reduce the number of Supreme Court judges, one to allow judicial candidates to take part in partisan events or hold positions in political organizations — have also failed to garner majority support. 
So far, just one bill on the topic has made it to the governor’s desk. House Bill 39, now codified in Montana Code, allows political parties to contribute to the campaigns of judicial candidates. While HB 39 doesn’t attach a letter to a candidate’s name on the ballot, it opens the door for more money, and more clearly partisan money, to enter judicial races. 
  The final (for now) debate 


The state of the partisan judiciary
SB 42 — Requiring political affiliation in judicial races — Senate:✓ House: X 
SB 543 — MT Supreme Court can indicate political affiliation — Senate: X
HB 39 — Allow political parties to contribute to judicial candidates — House:✓  Senate:✓ Governor: ✓

HB 506 — Constitutional amendment to appoint judges — Committee: X
HB 751 — Requiring MT Supreme Court candidates indicate political party or be “undisclosed” — House: X
HB 838 — MT Supreme Court can indicate political affiliation —  House: X



Many lawmakers stood up on the debate for HB 838 Monday afternoon, with the longest speeches coming from those in opposition. 
Opponents cited the clear desire from representatives, as seen in previous votes, to keep the courts as nonpartisan as possible, despite massive increases in spending in recent elections and the perceived slant of recent state Supreme Court decisions. 
Others cited the slower turnover of the courts compared to other elected positions — state Supreme Court judges serve eight-year terms while representatives serve just two — and urged lawmakers to let the changes take their natural course. 
“Montana recently switched from a purple state to a red state,” said Rep. George Nikolakakos, R-Great Falls. “It takes time to lag behind and offer that counter balance. In many ways, that’s a feature of the system. As frustrating as it is, it’s not a bug. It ensures our courts are separated from the political passion of the day.”
But many Republicans backed the Speaker’s bill, using many of the same arguments made throughout this session-long debate. One of the primary cases made by proponents is that partisan affiliation is a voter-education tool. 
“We have people coming to us to say, who should we vote for the judge? Because I’m not spending time coming out and not looking at the cases they heard,” said Rep. Gary Parry, R-Colstrip. “If you think for a minute that the judges aren’t going with an ideology, I challenge that. I just don’t think that keeping the public uninformed about it is the way to go … (This bill) at least gives the voters an opportunity to make an informed choice.”
Several representatives said they would prefer to consider a different system altogether, namely letting the governor appoint justices with either Legislative confirmation or from a short list selected by a commission. More than half of states have some version of an appointment system for their highest courts. 
A bill heard earlier this session would have asked Montana voters to consider a constitutional amendment to allow the governor to appoint Supreme Court justices from a slate selected by a bipartisan commission, but that proposal never made it past a committee hearing. 
House Majority Leader Steve Fitzpatrick, R-Great Falls, said that as a lawyer, he looks for judges who are fair, follow the law and listen to attorneys. And during the last decade, he said he’s seen the system evolve further into partisanship and pushed his caucus to back the bill. 
He said the partisan judicial bills are “simply a response to what’s going on.”
“If we want these bills to go away, I think it’s time for the judiciary to step up and make them go away,” he said.
Rep. Jonathan Karlen, D-Missoula, said that while lawmakers ascribe to a partisan label in order to advocate for and push forward a party platform that they stand behind, judges have an altogether different job that doesn’t involve toeing a party line.  
Adding judges directly into the partisan mix would have candidates for court echoing party lines, chasing endorsements and campaigning purely on ideology, he said. 
“That’s not an impartial court,” Karlen said. “That’s legislators in red robes and blue robes.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Old_Supco2-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-04-07 20:06:27.350473

As of Monday morning, the campaign for Judge Susan Crawford, who won the Court race, spent $22 million compared with the campaign for Judge Brad Schimel, which spent just under $10 million.
While the campaigns spent a combined $32 million, independent groups supporting the campaigns spent a combined $51 million. Schimel was the larger beneficiary of independent spending, with $33.5 million in his favor or opposing Crawford. Independent spending that favored Crawford or opposed Schimel totaled $18 million.
In the race for state superintendent, the two candidates’ campaigns — for  incumbent Jill Underly, who won, and for her challenger, Brittany Kinser — were just about even in their spending, with $1.3 million for Underly and $1.1 million for Kinser.
Independent spending, however, heavily favored Underly at $1.9 million. Independent spending for Kinser totaled $160,000.
Research director DeForest-Davis said the organization will have a final report in July on spending data, including spending on issue ads that don’t include explicit messages to vote for or against a candidate but are slanted to clearly favor one or the other. That information won’t be available until the end of June. 
Along with the campaign finance data released Monday, the Democracy Campaign released results from an opinion poll of Wisconsin voters on campaign finance.
The survey, of 861 voters conducted from Feb. 11-14, found that 88% of participants were “very concerned” or “extremely concerned” about the influence of money in politics.
“I have a hard time thinking of an issue that has this kind of universal feedback across the state,” Ramos said. “After seeing the gaudy amount of money that was spent in this Supreme Court race, I can only imagine that this number and this percentage are going to increase.”
Nearly as many — more than 85% — said “no” when asked if individuals or groups should be able to spend “unlimited amounts of money” to support political campaigns.  And 83% said there should be limits on how much campaigns can spend.
Nearly 74% said they would support a ban on campaign spending “by outside political action committees (PACs) that are not directly affiliated with a candidate’s campaign.” About 53% ranked spending by “dark money PACS who do not have to disclose their donors” as their greatest concern where the influence of money on politics is concerned.
Another question showed that so far publicly financed campaigns haven’t gained support from a majority of voters. Almost 47% said they would “strongly” or “somewhat” support such a proposal. Just under 30% said they would “somewhat” or “strongly” oppose public financing, while 23.5% said they were unsure.

Sen. Mike Zimmer, D-DeWitt, called the bill a “much needed improvement” to the current grain indemnity policy. 
“What makes me most anxious about it is that with every day tariffs coming on, every day our markets are being closed for our farmers and their commodities,” Zimmer said. “The ability for our grain elevators to store this grain while they continue to look for other markets is very, very important.”

Senate File 608 would increase the minimum of the grain indemnity fund to $5 million and the maximum to $12 million. This is an increase from the current parameters, which are set at $3 million and $8 million, though it is not as great an increase as a bill proposed in the Iowa House of Representatives. The House bill would increase the fund’s range to $8 million and $16 million. 
SF 608 would also include “grain purchased under credit-sale contract” under the definition of “purchased grain” meaning grain purchased on a credit sale would be eligible for the same indemnity protections.
The House version of the bill would also include credit-sale contracts, but would reimburse those contracts at a rate of 70% of the grain purchased. 
Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, R-Walcott, added a minor clarifying amendment to the bill, which passed. 
The bill advances after a vote of 39-8. 
House File 508 has yet to be debated on the House floor.

Pictured from left are Rhoden, Alkire, Armstrong, former Standing Rock Chairman Charles Murphy, Councilman Cyril Archambault and Councilman John Pretty Bear. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)FORT YATES, N.D. – Leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe asked governors of North Dakota and South Dakota for help Monday as they face uncertainties with federal funding under President Donald Trump.
The comments came during a rare meeting that brought North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong and South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden to consult with Standing Rock Tribal Chairwoman Janet Alkire and other tribal council members.
Alkire, Armstrong and Rhoden, who convened in the council chambers of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Administrative Center, said they couldn’t recall the last time both governors were in Fort Yates at the same time.
The Standing Rock Reservation straddles North Dakota and South Dakota. This puts the tribe in the unique situation of having to manage overlapping jurisdiction with both states and the federal government.
Federal spending cuts threaten several services in Indian Country the federal government is legally required to provide, including programs that support public education, health care and law enforcement, Stateline reported last month.

Multiple Standing Rock councilors asked Armstrong and Rhoden what the tribe can do to navigate these changes.
“We all know there’s gonna be more,” Alkire said.
Both governors said they share concerns about the cuts.
“We’re in the mode of monitoring, just like you are,” Rhoden said.
He defended the Trump administration’s actions as necessary to bring federal spending under control.
“It’s been many decades since I felt like we had a president that’s actually looking beyond the horizon on fixing what’s wrong with America,” he said.
Alkire said she supports streamlining federal programs if it means Native nations get greater autonomy over their own resources, but she worries tribal communities will suffer if their services are cut.
“We in Indian Country have always faced underfunding, so when you cut something for us, it’s drastic,” Alkire said.
She said Standing Rock is counting on the North Dakota and South Dakota governments and their congressional delegations to make sure the federal government honors its responsibility to Native nations.
Armstrong said he hopes tribal leaders alert their state counterparts as soon as they face issues.
“When disruption happens, we need to know,” he said.
Setting the funding cuts aside, Alkire said the federal government has long neglected to address a laundry list of tribal sovereignty issues. The tribe needs more funding and staff from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as fewer restrictions on access to federal land and the Missouri River, to name a few, she said.

“I told Secretary Burgum that he had his work cut out for him,” Alkire said, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Armstrong’s predecessor as governor.
Development was another recurring theme of the meeting.
John Pretty Bear, a district representative, asked Rhoden if he would ask D.C. to fund water infrastructure development in western South Dakota.
“It’s 2025, and we still have people that haul water,” Pretty Bear said.
Rhoden said he’s aware of the issue.
“I live in the middle of Meade County, and if you look at a water map of South Dakota as far as rural water projects, it is a black hole in that area,” he said.
Councilors also asked the governors to help support economic development on the reservation so the tribe’s younger generation can find jobs
“We need more businesses,” District Representative Joe White Mountain Jr. said. “Our kids are growing up and they don’t really have a future.”
During a January address to North Dakota state lawmakers, Alkire called infrastructure a top priority for the tribe.
Standing Rock hopes to one day build a bridge over the Missouri River connecting the reservation to Emmons County. Currently, to cross the Missouri River, Fort Yates residents must drive roughly an hour north to Bismarck or an hour south to Mobridge.
The U.S. The Department of Transportation recently awarded the tribe a $14.5 million planning grant for the project, but more support will be needed to make the dream a reality, Akire said in the address.
A bill signed by Armstrong in March authorizes the North Dakota Department of Transportation to accept ownership of the bridge if it gets built.
Tribal officials said both states could do a better job of consulting with Standing Rock on a variety of issues, including education, transportation, gaming and land use.

Rhoden, formerly South Dakota’s lieutenant governor, assumed office at a low point for tribal relations in the state.
Leaders of all nine Native American reservations in South Dakota voted to ban Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem — now the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security — from their lands. The votes were in response to Noem’s rhetoric about Indigenous communities in the state, including an unsubstantiated accusation that tribal leaders were “personally benefiting” from Mexican drug cartels, and an assertion that Native American children “don’t have any hope.”
“I think this is an important day in our history and in the road to recovery, as far as rebuilding our relationships,” Rhoden said Monday.
Armstrong’s predecessor, Burgum, was widely regarded as an ally to the five federally recognized tribes that share land with North Dakota.
Armstrong said Burgum’s appointment to the Interior presents “unique opportunities” to the tribe, North Dakota and South Dakota, and he hopes the three governments can continue working toward their common interests.
“There’s not a lot of people that can get me out of Bismarck on less than a week’s notice when the Legislature’s meeting, but when the Chairwoman calls, we say yes,’” said Armstrong.

(Photo courtesy of SLED) COLUMBIA — Eleven people were arrested and more than 160 dogs were rescued in South Carolina’s second-largest bust ever of a dogfighting ring in the Palmetto State, authorities announced Monday.
Beyond finding bloodied dogs, the officers who went to 10 homes in Dillon and Marion counties with arrest warrants last Wednesday and Thursday seized lots of drugs, cash and guns, according to a news release from the State Law Enforcement Division, which coordinated the bust. One of the 11 people arrested turned himself in Friday.

“If you are involved in dogfighting in South Carolina, we will find you, we will arrest you and we will hold you accountable,” SLED Chief Mark Keel said at a news conference Monday with Gov. Henry McMaster at the agency’s forensic lab.
In all, officers took $69,700 in cash, 55 guns and an assortment of drugs that included 17 pounds of marijuana, 11 grams of crack cocaine, one gram of cocaine, two grams of ketamine, 990 fentanyl pills and 2,266 ecstasy pills, according to the release.
Most of the 11 face charges of animal fighting, a felony that carries a penalty of up to five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, and ill treatment of animals. On first offense, that charge is a misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail and a $1,000 fine. Additional convictions are punishable by up to two years in prison and a $2,000 fine.
In one home, the drugs and guns were not secured away from children, leading to an additional charge of unlawfully placing a child at risk, Keel said.
Organizations involved in the takedown and rescue of the animals include drug task forces from both North and South Carolina and the sheriffs for Dillon and Marion counties.

“SLED is fortunate to partner with local law enforcement departments, sheriff’s offices, and our federal agencies and task forces,” Keel said.
Jennifer Bonovich, a forensic veterinarian at the announcement, described the trauma endured by the dogs as a “fate worse than death.”
The dogs made to fight are chained, battered, bruised and often malnourished as people sit to the side attempting to profit off that pain.
“Bones are crushed and fractured, all of this while members of your community are watching and cheering,” said Bonovich, who said she works with SLED and goes to the crime scenes to evaluate the animals.
SLED started a four-person dogfighting unit in 2023 and has rescued 492 dogs, leading to the arrest of 116 people, according to statistics from the agency.
That tally includes last week’s bust.
Marion and Dillon counties lead the state with the most dogs seized since Jan. 1, 2024, with 82 and 72 respectively, followed by Richland (45), Darlington (43) and Georgetown (40), according to a map of counties SLED provided Monday.
“This is an unspeakable thing that’s happening,” said McMaster, who began leading the fight against dogfighting in South Carolina long before his time in the Governor’s Mansion.

It was McMaster who started South Carolina’s anti-dogfighting task force with then-SLED Chief Robert Stewart in 2004.
In his January State of the State address, he again asked the Legislature to provide SLED more money to “end this unforgivable savagery.” He added that “most of the people participating in this barbaric activity have long criminal records.”
SLED asked legislators for $500,000 in the coming fiscal year to cover the veterinary bills and care of dogs it rescues from dogfighting ring. But the House didn’t include any additional money for the unit in the plan it passed last month. The Senate’s budget-writing committee is crafting its spending plan this week.
Last year, McMaster asked legislators to provide $566,286, which they did. In 2022, the Legislature sent SLED $181,148 for the salary and equipment of an agent dedicated to animal-fighting enforcement — again, matching McMaster’s request.
“We have to put a stop to it,” McMaster said Monday.
When SLED rescues the dogs, it partners with organizations like the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals to find facilities where they can be nurtured and hopefully one day adopted, said Matthew Bershadker, president of the ASPCA, who was at the announcement.
SLED rescued more than 200 dogs last year. A new law allowed for their quicker adoption.

Once they are cared for, they often find homes and live out a normal life, McMaster said.
Until last year, the cost of prosecuting animal fighting rings and the long-term care of their victims allowed abusers to escape paying for their crimes. As these cases dragged on, potentially for years, the costs fell on taxpayers. The dogs couldn’t be adopted until the criminal charges were resolved.
That changed with a law dubbed the “cost of care” act, which McMaster signed last May after both chambers passed it unanimously.
It flipped the financial burden of care from the government to the accused — and allowed for the dog’s placement with new, loving owners much faster.
As long as a judge determines the seizure was justified, an accused owner must either pay for the dog’s care for the duration of the case or immediately forfeit ownership, allowing the dog to be adopted.
“This law is critically important for law enforcement to pursue animal cruelty investigations,” Bershadker said, “and it helps ensure that the animals get the treatment that they need and deserve.”
SLED encourages anyone with information regarding dogfighting to contact its tipline at 866-472-8477 or email tips.sled.sc.gov.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) speaks at an Oct. 2 campaign event with Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance in Auburn Hills. | Kyle DavidsonAfter months of speculation, U.S. Rep. John James (R-Shelby Twp.) announced on Monday he will join the race for Michigan governor rather than seeking another term in the House of Representatives. 
In an announcement on social media, James, who is serving his second term in Congress, said that Michigan is being held back by a lack of strong competent leadership, telling voters “It’s time to get Michigan’s government out of fantasyland and back to common sense.”
“President [Donald] Trump and I have been in each other’s corners through thick and thin for eight years — no reason that will end now. He’s doing his part to make America great again and I’ll do mine to bring prosperity and sanity back to Michigan,” James said.
James unsuccessfully ran for the U.S. Senate in 2018 against now-retired Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Lansing), netting Trump’s endorsement during the Republican primary, where he faced businessman Sandy Pensler. He ran another unsuccessful campaign against Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield Twp.) in 2020 before he was elected to represent Michigan’s 10th Congressional District in 2022, winning reelection in 2024. 
James joins state Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Twp.) and truck driver Anthony Hudson in seeking the Republican nomination for governor. On the Democratic side, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and Genesee County Sheriff Chris Swanson have each announced their campaigns for governor, while Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan, a longtime Democrat, is running as an independent.
Following James’ announcement, Curtis Hertel, chair of the Michigan Democratic Party released a statement, chiding the Congressman for declining to hold town hall meetings with constituents upset with proposed cuts to federal programs by the Trump administration.
“John James has spent his career failing in statewide elections and failing to show up for his own district, so why would we trust him to show up for Michiganders as governor? At a time when Donald Trump is tanking our economy, Michigan needs a leader who won’t just fight for billionaires, but will fight for everyone – John James is not that man,” said Hertel.

At a sparsely attended news conference Monday in Harrisburg, Reps. Jared Solomon (D-Philadelphia) and Jim Rigby (R-Cabria) spoke with optimism about the 38th try they’re spearheading. 
“This is the hard stuff, the egregious stuff, the headline making stuff … I’m talking the vacation homes, the cars, the jewelry,” Solomon said. “This tries to do something very simple, it says we’re not going to tolerate it.”
The legislation, co-sponsored by Solomon and Rigby, would bar elected officials, public employees and nominees or candidates for public office from taking or seeking gifts of cash or any item worth more than $50. 
Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle in Harrisburg have rejected claims that expensive gifts rarely influence policymakers’ decisions and that constituents should not be concerned. But for decades, the General Assembly has failed to pass legislation that would end what critics say amounts to legalized bribery.
Each of the dozens of bills introduced over the years has been an attempt to reach consensus on a commonsense gift ban, Michael Pollack, executive director of the government-reform group MarchOnHarrisburg, said.
“We can discuss the details of this bill and those other bills but this is going to be chopped to shreds and rewritten eight times,” he told the Capital-Star. “It’s not a matter of what the exact right policy prescription is, it’s a matter of political will.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Current law lets lawmakers accept gifts from anyone, if they disclose items more than $250 on annual interest forms. Legislation to clamp down on gifts, including bills that Solomon has co-sponsored with Republican colleagues in the last two sessions, has died without advancing beyond the House State Government Committee.
Solomon noted House Bill 744 includes reasonable exceptions, as the legislation has in the past.
“If you get a dinner in Harrisburg, I don’t think you’re susceptible to bribery. If you’re in your district and you accept cookies from a constituent who says, ‘Job well done,’ I think that’s okay,” Solomon said. Such exceptions, including donations to be passed on to help constituents, would allow lawmakers to continue doing their jobs.
The exceptions cover gifts, hospitality, transportation or lodging from family members and from lobbyists related to a celebration of a major life event, such as a wedding or the birth of a child, or when a lobbyist and a public official are involved in a personal romantic relationship.
Rigby said dinners and events offered to lawmakers are often educational, especially for those who are new to elected office. House Bill 744 would allow members of the General Assembly to continue interacting with constituents and advocates, and Rigby said those types of events aren’t the problem.
“I didn’t come to Harrisburg for the bennies, for the perks, for the big events, I don’t think any of us did,” Rigby said, adding that. “I thought this is a good place to start, and it certainly has its value.”

Pollack pinned the failure of gift ban legislation on leadership in both chambers, noting that its difficult for leaders to admit fault in the institutions they oversee and to recognize their own humanity.
“It shatters their own self image and that gets a response of arrogance and anger a lot of the time,” Pollack said.
Spokespeople for House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery), Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) and Senate President Pro Tempore Kim Ward (R-Westmoreland) did not respond to a request for comment.
Solomon, who made an unsuccessful bid for attorney general last year, agreed that reforming the legislature is particularly difficult for those who would be subject to the new rules.
“I’ve often thought, maybe if we make this bill effective 20 years from now … maybe we could get passage through the legislature,” Solomon said. 
In the 2022-23 legislative session, MarchOnHarrisburg recruited a lawmaker to force a vote on a bill that would ban legislators from accepting gifts, transportation, and recreation exceeding $250 from a single person each year.
The move would have directly defied Republican leadership, specifically then-Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, R-Centre, who controlled the chamber’s voting calendar. Ultimately, no one made a move and the legislation remained stuck in committee.
MarchOnHarrisburg, which also advocates for campaign finance reform, the end of dark money campaign spending and other issues involving transparency and political accountability, has continued to push for the gift ban.
Last month, the group’s members spent a day “bird dogging” lawmakers for answers on their support or silence on a gift ban and plans to release them to constituents.
But the pressure not to rock the boat that individual lawmakers face from their caucus leaders, lobbyists and donors is real, Pollack said. He noted that rank-and-file lawmakers who stepped out of line in the past have been stripped of committee assignments, staff and even their Capitol offices.
It’s also legal for lawmakers to have side jobs, despite Pennsylvania having a full-time legislature, and to promote legislation to benefit industries with which they have business relationships.
“All of these things add up to a really deep culture of corruption,” Pollack said. “If we don’t do it, we just continue to be governed by smaller and smaller numbers of people with money and influence.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Screen-Shot-2021-10-13-at-1.20.02-PM-1024x756.png,,,2025-04-07 20:06:27.350473

(Screenshot/Google Maps)Over 25,000 patients will need to find new pediatricians and primary care doctors before Anchor Medical Associates closes all three of its offices by June 30.
The physician group’s Bald Hill Road location in Warwick will shutter on April 30. Warwick patients can continue seeing their provider at the medical group’s Commerce Street location in Lincoln. On June 30, both the Lincoln location and the adult medicine office on Corliss street in Providence will close. A closure notice was first sent to patients last week, WPRI-TV reported on Friday. 
“The decision to close our practices has been extremely difficult, particularly against the backdrop of a shortage of primary care physicians across the state,” the practice stated in its letter to patients, which was posted to its website Monday. “While our commitment to our patients remains strong, we just cannot continue to operate in this increasingly challenging healthcare environment.”
The practice was incorporated in 1999. There are currently 22 providers listed on Anchor’s website. Over the last decade, the practice said it has had great difficulty in hiring new doctors to replace retiring physicians. 
“While costs continue to rise, reimbursement rates make it extremely difficult to attract new physicians to our state,” the letter stated. 
Anchor stated that for patients who need to find new doctors, it wants to “make this as smooth a transition as possible,” and is encouraging patients to obtain copies of their medical records within the next 90 days.  
A records request form is available on the practice’s website. Records will continue to be available after June 30, according to the Anchor website.
The Rhode Island Department of Health posted an announcement about the closure on its website and is advising patients to do two things: begin searching for a new primary care provider, and request copies of medical records. The health department notes that while records can be obtained after the closure date, “it is best to obtain them beforehand.”  
More Medicaid, more reimbursement problems for Rhode Island providers
The Hospital Association of Rhode Island (HARI) called the closure is another blow to the already wounded state of primary care.
“These unfortunate events highlight how Rhode Island’s health care crisis is very real, and getting worse,” Howard Dulude, the trade group’s interim president, said in a statement released Monday.
Addressing subpar provider reimbursement rates has been a recurring motif at the State House. A sizable number of Rhode Islanders receive health care through public insurance like Medicaid, more so than in neighboring states, but Rhode Island’s Medicaid reimbursement rates lag behind other states. Hospitals blasted Gov. Dan McKee earlier this year when the governor’s budget made no room for higher reimbursements.
HARI has put its weight behind three bills this legislative session, each with a Senate and House version, and two of them focused on improving the Medicaid reimbursement rate problem. The Family Health Care Act is a joint resolution that would OK a $90,000 appropriation to the Executive Office of Health and Human Services to help the agency raise Medicaid reimbursement rates. Both versions have been introduced in their respective chambers but have not yet been scheduled for hearings. 
Another Medicaid bill that has been introduced in both chambers but not yet heard by committees would funnel money from hospital licensing fees toward increasing Medicaid reimbursements for hospitals. Starting in fiscal year 2026, which begins on July 1, hospitals would be organized into a new three-tier system, and with their size, services and patient population informing their tier placement.
Hospitals with higher proportions of Medicaid and uninsured patients would pay less in fees than bigger hospital systems. Once the state collects $90 million in these fees, any excess funds would be poured into Medicaid reimbursements. 
A third bill backed by HARI would make the state more competitive with Massachusetts and Connecticut and grant the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner (OHIC) greater regulatory power over commercial health insurers’ payments to hospitals and providers. The commissioner would need to review and approve annual increases in hospital contracts and provider payment rates if the total cost of care exceeds the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers plus 3%.

Andy Beshear for vetoing a provision that would have helped private schools hire police. The proposal surfaced in the Senate on March 14, the last day before the veto break.  Conferring with Wise on the Senate floor March 14 are Senate President Robert Stivers, left, and Sen. Chris McDaniel. (LRC Public Information)Months after Kentucky voters rejected a constitutional amendment that would have allowed public funds to support nonpublic schools, Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear applied the same logic in a line-item veto. 
Beshear’s veto spurred Senate Republicans to issue a news release Friday and again Monday headlined “Senator Max Wise rips governor’s veto of school safety provision,” asserting that the proposed public funding would have gone to law enforcement agencies not the private schools that could have used it to employ police as school resource officers.
The provision, which surfaced on the 28th day of the 30-day session and received little attention, directed the Kentucky Department of Education to provide up to $20,000 to help nonpublic schools employ a law enforcement officer on their campuses. 
The Senate added the provision to House Bill 622 which modified state contract and invoicing procedures. Public schools also were eligible for the assistance in hiring security personnel known as school resource officers. The Senate authorized spending $5 million a year over the current biennium.
When the legislature reconvened after the 10-day veto period, the House rejected the Senate version and the legislation went to a free conference committee, which also recommended the aid to put officers in private as well as public schools. Both chambers approved the conference committee’s proposal on March 28. That was the day the legislature adjourned meaning the Republican-controlled legislature had no chance to override a Beshear veto.
Beshear issued a line-item veto last week, striking the aid to private schools as well as some of the original bill’s contracting requirements.
In response, Wise, the Senate Republican floor leader, accused Beshear of politicizing school safety. 
Kentuckians say ‘no’ to public funding for private, charter schools

“Governor Beshear’s line-item veto sends an unmistakable and deeply disturbing message to families across the commonwealth: If your child attends a private school, their safety matters less,” Wise said. “As the primary sponsor of the 2019 School Safety and Resiliency Act, I’ve spent years working so that every Kentucky student, teacher, and staff member—regardless of ZIP code, income level, or school type—is protected from the threats facing our world today. The Governor’s decision doesn’t just fly in the face of a bipartisan mission — it politicizes it.” 
Wise, of Campbellsville, sponsored a 2019 school safety law in the aftermath of a shooting at Marshall County High School. Beshear signed that law. A 2022 update to the law, also signed by Beshear, requires a school resource officer (SRO), a type of sworn law enforcement officer, on each campus in Kentucky, although the legislature has never fully funded  that mandate. Last year Wise successfully sponsored legislation allowing volunteer “guardians” to fill vacant law enforcement positions at schools. 
In his recent veto message, Beshear pushed back on using public funds in nonpublic schools and cited a proposed constitutional amendment that voters rejected last fall that would have allowed the General Assembly to fund nonpublic schools, such as private or charter schools. 
“All Kentucky children deserve to be safe in their schools, but the Kentucky Constitution requires public funds be used for only public schools,” Beshear wrote. He added the Kentucky Supreme Court has ruled against supporting nonpublic schools with public funds.
In 2022, the state’s high court struck down a 2021 Kentucky law creating a generous tax credit to help families pay for tuition at private schools. The next year Franklin Circuit Judge Phillip Shepherd struck down a charter school law passed in 2022.
Wise accused Beshear of “appeasing special interests and institutions” and pointed out that parents who send their children to private schools pay taxes to support public schools and other local services such as law enforcement.
Wise also argued that Beshear “has chosen to punish Kentucky families for making a decision that was right for them,” as parents of nonpublic school students pay taxes for local services. The senator vowed that the Republican-controlled state legislature “will not be silent in the face of this reckless decision” and that student safety “is not negotiable.”
The final version of HB 622 that passed on the legislature’s last day also included $30 million to expand a sewage treatment plant in Elizabethtown; $20 million to help communities experiencing economic growth presumably from the electric-vehicle battery plant being built in Glendale, and $10 million for infrastructure in Grayson County. Beshear allowed those provisions to become law. 
The legislature overrode Beshear’s vetoes of bills that were passed in time for the Republican majority to overturn them.

Now, with Florida Republicans already passing strong measures this year cracking down on illegal immigration to align with President Donald Trump’s goal of mass deportations, a proposal (HB 955) that would require all private employers in Florida to use the E-Verify system to check each employee’s legal status won approval by its second committee in the House on Monday, and now will go to the floor for a final vote.
“It builds upon what we’ve already done here in the state of Florida,” said Pinellas County Republican Rep. Berny Jacques, a co-sponsor along with Jacksonville Republican Kiyan Michael.
“Prior to two years ago, there was no requirement whatsoever for private employers, unless if you were contracting with the state government. We did a requirement for 25 or more employees, so that closes that gap to make sure that the workforce integrity is uplifted and we are making sure that every worker in this state is authorized to do so legally.”
The Legislature passed significant measures cracking down on illegal immigration in a special session in early February, including making it a misdemeanor for immigrants over the age of 18 to “knowingly” enter Florida and imposing the death penalty for immigrants lacking permanent legal status who are convicted of capital crimes such as murder or sexual abuse of minors under 12.
Thomas Kennedy with the Florida Immigrant Coalition said the expansion of E-Verify was a “bad deal for Floridians,” noting the state is already facing an acute worker shortage.
“At a time where we are basically touching all the ‘do not touch’ buttons in terms of wrecking our economy, including mass layoffs, increasing prices, undermining consumer and international confidence, why would we continue messing with our state, with our workforce?” he asked the House Commerce Committee.
Democratic support
However, both Republicans and some Democrats applauded the measure.
“Every job in Florida should go to someone who is legally authorized to work in this country. Period,” said Panhandle Republican Rep. Michelle Salzman. “We must prioritize American workers and Florida families who are here legally.”
Miami-Dade Republican David Borrero questioned why anyone on the committee could opposed E-Verify for all businesses. And he said it would encourage employers to pay higher wages for American workers.
“If you are opposed to this bill, then what you are saying is that you are okay creating an environment where people can break the law,” he said.
“You are okay with an environment where they can take away jobs from the American people. … [I]f this is truly creating a working shortage, then what that means is that we do not have reasonable-paying jobs in these industries. And so you know what happens is that when you take away these jobs from undocumented immigrants, maybe now we’re going to have jobs that pay reasonable rates — maybe now developers, contractors, farmers where they’re actually going to pay reasonable rates for the American people. That’s what’s going to happen.”
Florida is one of 23 states that use E-Verify in some fashion, although only a handful require all private companies to use the system.
The bill passed, 19-3, with three Democrats joining every Republican on the House Commerce Committee supporting it.
Whether the proposal makes it into law is in question, though, as the Legislature begins its sixth week in the nine-week session. None of the bills filed in the Senate that addresses E-Verify have been heard in any committee yet.

House Bill 1300, sponsored by Rep. Ben Koppelman, R-West Fargo, aimed to clear up confusion about the term limits initiative passed by North Dakota voters in 2022.
Under the bill, which was amended in the Senate, the clock would start on lawmaker term limits for appointments or elections after Jan. 1, 2023.
The original version of the bill had a Nov. 7, 2022, start date and would have given lawmakers elected in 2020 in even-numbered districts an additional two years in the Legislature. The Senate version also would have increased the terms for legislators in odd-numbered districts elected in 2022.
Term limits changes revived for possible statewide vote in North Dakota

Under the term limits section of the state constitution, each lawmaker is able to serve up to two, four-year terms in each chamber of the Legislature. The law also limits the members of the Legislature from amending or repealing the term limits section of the constitution, which can only be amended by an “initiative petition of the people.”
Senate Resolution 4008 passed both chambers of the Legislature and could be put on the 2026 general election ballot, if approved by the Secretary of State’s Office as a valid resolution. The resolution would allow lawmakers to serve four terms, up to 16 years, in a single legislative chamber.

Kelly Armstrong speaks during a press conference on banning student cellphone use in North Dakota on March 26, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota lawmakers passed bills Monday that would prohibit student cellphone use during the school day, reviving one bill that had been defeated last week.
Senate Bill 2354 and House Bill 1160 differ on which schools would be affected and whether school districts would have the power to allow cellphone use during noninstructional time, such as in between classes or over the school lunch period. The bills are expected to have their differences ironed out in conference committees, each made up of three legislators from each chamber.
Senate Bill 2354 passed the House on a 61-29 vote.
The Senate bill, amended by the House Education Committee, would require all schools, public and private, to follow the statewide student cellphone ban. The House bill would only affect public school students. 
Under the Senate bill, students would be allowed to stow their phones in their lockers while turned off, or on silent, instead being secured in a lockbox or lockable pouch purchased by the school district.
School boards would also have the ability to create their own cellphone policies for student-use during noninstructional time under the Senate bill. The House bill would ban the use of the devices from “bell to bell.”
Rep. Anna Novak, R-Hazen, voted in favor of the Senate bill and said limiting cellphone use would have a positive impact on the mental health of students
“Each school district knows what’s best for their respective schools and should be allowed to tailor their own policy based on their school’s needs as long as it fits in the parameters of this bill,” Novak said.
Bill to ban student cellphone use fails in ND Senate; House expected to take up issue Monday

Rep. Daniel Johnston, R-Kathryn, said he voted against the bill because it regulates private schools the same as public schools.
“We should limit it to public school,” Johnston said. 
Both bills allow students access to their phones while traveling between learning sites, such as career and technical academies. 
The bills also require school districts to collect data on their cellphone policies to judge the impact on student behavior, mental health, disciplinary incidents, school attendance  and academic performance. The districts will report the data to the Department of Public Instruction, which will be compiled into an annual report.
Sen. Michelle Axtman, R-Bismarck, requested a revote in the Senate after missing Friday’s vote where the House bill failed. 
She said if local school districts had been more proactive on phone policies, the bill would not have been necessary. 
She said passing it would be “one of the most impactful things we do for teacher retention in North Dakota.” 
The bill passed the Senate on a 42-4 reconsidered vote.
Sen. Mark Enget, R-Powers Lake, was among those who switched their vote from no to yes. He said he felt school districts in his part of the state had done a good job managing phone use, but also learned that’s not the case statewide.

Photo provided by Stand with Trans.A Michigan-based organization dedicated to serving the transgender community will mark its 10th anniversary next month, a milestone its founder said she couldn’t envision when she began the organization.
“Oh my gosh, no. I mean, I really didn’t know what I was doing,” executive director Roz Gould Keith told the Michigan Advance as she laughed, recalling  founding Stand with Trans in 2015 after her trans son came out two years earlier.
The nonprofit will celebrate May 17 with the “Love Transcends Gala” at the Pistons Performance Center in Detroit.
Keith said the organization emerged from her experience with her son, trying to learn as much as she could to help him.
“My son needed a community and he needed to know that he wasn’t alone because his perspective was ‘I don’t know anyone like me.’ It was probably going into our second year of managing all of this for him that we started seeing the community. There was just this groundswell of families who were desperate to connect,” she said. 
Keith said that she quickly realized that parents were also struggling, as she did, to do what was best for their child, noting that 10 years ago the social and political climate surrounding trans issues was completely different than it is now.


Tickets for the May 17 Love Transcends Gala are available for $150 per person, with a VIP Experience available for $250, which includes a meet-and-greet with honorees, the keynote speaker, the performer, and a VIP gift bag. 
Tickets can be purchased at bit.ly/SWT10 


“There was no political climate conversation. There was no concern about bathrooms or community safety in the way we’re talking about it now. It wasn’t a conversation about rights. It was just a human need,’’ she said.
The organization, which now boasts a staff of 10, began with a single community education event, which was followed by a parents group and then an empowerment workshop. From that modest beginning, Stand with Trans now provides everything from a Therapy Assistance Program, which provides trans-affirming mental health care in Michigan and in other states through tele-health appointments, to corporate training events for employers to better provide an affirming workspace, to a Banned Book Club.
As a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, Keith said there are limits to what they can do politically, but they can advocate for the community and also make sure that they provide education as well. Over the years, Keith says they’ve not only expanded their donor base, but also receive government and foundation grants.
“We just had a webinar on estate planning for LGBTQIA+ folks so whether they were in a marriage, long-term partnership, whatever the arrangement was, that they could better understand how to protect their rights,” said Keith. “We’re trying to stay on top of what’s going on and do the work that we do and run our programs and find funding.”
  Stand with Trans “Love Transcends Gala” will be held may 17, 2025 at the Detroit Pistons Training Center in Detroit.
Keeping all of that in mind, Keith said the anniversary gala is about celebrating their success through some trying times, including the COVID pandemic which forced them to cancel plans for their five-year anniversary.
“Ten years is a big milestone. Lots of businesses, lots of organizations, don’t make it this long. I’ve seen long-term nonprofits doing this work having to close their doors or lay off all their staff and we certainly don’t want to ever be in that situation and so we need to celebrate where we are today and all the accomplishments,” she said. 
The organization reached out to the Detroit Pistons, who offered up their training facility. 
“They are our venue sponsor. They provided the space to us, which is amazing. We’ve gotten some really great donations for a silent auction and you know it will be catered. There will be food, drinks, and a silent auction, with lots of opportunity for the community to connect,” she said.
The evening will feature a keynote address from bestselling author and nonbinary activist Jeffrey Marsh and singer, actress, and activist Mila Jam, as well as honoring champions of the trans community.
“We’re saying come dressed in gala glam. We want people to celebrate joy and come dressed ready to have a good time.”

The move comes several weeks after the agency canceled a Feb. 17 public hearing on the administrative process to remove that area from new mining for 20 years, which the Biden Administration had pursued in the final weeks in office. A temporary pause on mining had been in place since December.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that the Forest Service had cancelled two mineral leasing withdrawals in order to “help boost production of critical minerals” at the bottom of an April 4 news release announcing an increased domestic logging push.
A USDA spokesperson in an emailed statement identified those cancellations as the proposed Upper Pecos River watershed mining ban, as well as one in Nevada’s Ruby Mountains, and that the reversal stemmed from the January executive order titled “Unleashing American Energy.”
“Under President Trump’s leadership, USDA is removing the burdensome Biden-era regulations that have stifled energy and mineral development to revitalize rural communities and reaffirm America’s role as a global energy powerhouse,” the spokesperson wrote.
Other federal agencies that previously supported the mining ban under the past administration did not have further comment Monday.
The Bureau of Land Management acknowledged a Source NM request Monday, but did not provide comment before publication. The U.S. Department of the Interior, which oversees BLM, did not respond to emails for comment.
Ralph Vigil, an organizer for the nonprofit New Mexico Wilderness Alliance, told Source NM Monday he was unsurprised by the U.S. Forest Service’s decision under the new administration. Vigil said the Stop Terrero Mine Coalition — which includes agriculture, local and tribal governments, conservation and hunting groups opposing further development in the Upper Pecos — will need to consider its next steps.
“We’re going to continue our fight to do whatever we need to do to block this administration,” Vigil said.
Vigil, a parciante of the Acequia del Molino and local farmer living in Pecos, said much of the community opposition is rooted in the Terrero Mining disaster from 1991, during which floodwaters breached a defunct mine and sent mining tailing sludge downriver. The spill killed tens of thousands of fish and buried Willow Creek. Cleanup remains ongoing and has cost tens of millions of dollars, including state environment officials’ request for $5.7 million from the Legislature this year. An administrative ban can last for decades, but does not create a permanent ban on mining development, which requires full Congressional approval. Members of the New Mexico delegation introduced a bill to permanently ban mining development in the Upper Pecos
U.S. Sen. Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.) called the decision a “betrayal of trust,” in a written statement Monday, and said he’d move forward with similar legislation to ban mining in the area.
“The Trump administration’s decision is a betrayal of trust.  Not only does it reverse what the Pecos community has worked toward for years, it’s also incredibly out of touch. This kind of top-down decision-making — with zero attempt to discuss or even listen to the communities impacted — is exactly what’s wrong with this administration,” Heinrich said. “New Mexicans deserve clean water free from heavy metals. I will continue to push for permanent protection through my Pecos Watershed Protection Act. The Trump administration won’t stand with the people of New Mexico, but I always will.”
New Mexico Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard in March signed an executive order banning mineral mining on approximately 2,500 acres of state trust land in the Upper Pecos Watershed that will remain in place through 2045.
Vigil said any economic benefits logging and mining might bring would not outweigh future spills or destruction in the Pecos headwaters, already hard-hit by the 2022 Hermits Peak-Calf Canyon Fire.
“Putting the headwaters at risk isn’t beneficial for anyone downstream,” Vigil said. “Agriculture, outdoor recreation, these are economies we depend on, these other economies they want to bring in that are extractive, invasive and destructive will not be friendly to the community.”

Kennedy, Jr., for terminating nearly $11 billion in public health grants to the states. (Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha and his counterparts in New York and Hawaii are the lead plaintiffs in a complaint filed Friday against the Trump administration seeking to stop the dismantling of three federal agencies that support public libraries and museums, workers, and small businesses.
In all, 20 Democratic attorneys general are participating in the April 4 lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Providence challenging a portion of a March 14 executive order targeting seven agencies, including three mandated by Congress: the Institute of Museum and Library Services; the Minority Business Development Agency and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service.
The executive order placed almost the entire staff of the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) on administrative leave and will mean cutting hundreds of grants for state libraries and museums. The executive order also slashed the labor organizing staff and programs of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) and forced the Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA) to cut its grant programs that support small business owners. 
“This order continues the reduction in the elements of the Federal bureaucracy that the President has determined are unnecessary,” President Donald Trump wrote.
“As the President and his Administration continue their attempts to dismantle the federal government, Americans would do well to consider their priorities,” Neronha said. “What do these three agencies have in common? At first glance, maybe little. But if you take a closer look, you may realize that all three agencies empower everyday people in this country to access their full potential, whether it be through knowledge, workers’ rights, or small business support. By unlawfully attacking these agencies, they are attempting to stifle the American dream. We won’t let them, and neither should you.”
IMLS administers the Library Services and Technology Act (LSTA) which last year invested $180 million in libraries nationwide under its Grants to States Program. The Rhode Island Office of Library and Information Services (OLIS) received over $1.4 million in fiscal year 2025.
The funding supported core services and programs for Rhode Island libraries, including the Talking Books Library program for blind and print-disabled Rhode Islanders, the statewide summer reading program, statewide interlibrary book delivery services, and funding for nearly half of the state’s OLIS staff positions, according to a statement from the Rhode Island Library Association. 
“The Rhode Island Library Association opposes the cutting of federal funding to IMLS and stands in support of IMLS, museums and libraries nationwide,” the association wrote. “RILA also strongly opposes the reduction of IMLS staff to a level that makes it unable to fulfill its statutory duties. As library workers, we are concerned about the implications that the elimination of IMLS funding and staffing will have on Rhode Island libraries and its residents.”
The FMCS has slashed its staff from roughly 200 to fewer than 15 individuals and announced the termination of several of its core programs, making it harder for unionized workers to secure their rights, according to the lawsuit.










By unlawfully attacking these agencies, they are attempting to stifle the American dream. We won’t let them, and neither should you.


–  Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha


Many of Rhode Island’s collective bargaining agreements rely on mediation through FMCS, which slashed its staff from about 200 to fewer than 15 individuals. DCYF and one of its unions used the services of FMCS last year, avoiding a strike that could have compromised DCYF’s ability to ensure stability and security for children in their care.
The Trump administration has cut the number of MBDA staff from 40 to five and has effectively stopped issuing new grants, hurting vulnerable small businesses across the country. The MBDA provides many valuable services to Rhode Island’s small businesses, including one-on-one guidance and expertise on business strategies and resources, Neronha’s office said. The MBDA also provides grants for incubators such as Rhode Island’s Small Business HUB.
The coalition argues the executive order violates the Constitution and the Administrative Procedure Act by eliminating the programs of agencies without any regard for the laws and regulations that govern each source of federal funding. The AGs say the president cannot decide to unilaterally override laws governing federal spending, adding that the executive order unconstitutionally overrides Congress’ power to decide how federal funds are spent.
The two other lead plaintiffs in the lawsuit are Attorney General Letitia James of New York and Attorney General Anne Lopez of Hawaii. Joining the lawsuit are the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
“We had to sue to stop Trump from defunding our schools and cancer cures, from defunding energy assistance and vaccines, from defunding disaster relief and the police. Now, we have to sue again to stop him from defunding summer reading programs and audiobooks for disabled veterans,” Connecticut Attorney General William Tong said in a report by Connecticut Mirror.
The Connecticut State Library receives $2.2 million in annual funding from IMLS, Tong said.
The other four agencies affected by the president’s executive order but not the subject of the lawsuit are the United States Agency for Global Media, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in the Smithsonian Institution, the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness, and the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund.

Larry Rhoden and Standing Rock Chairwoman Janet Alkire converse during a meeting Monday morning in Fort Yates. (Provided by North Dakota Governor's Office)FORT YATES, N.D. – Leaders of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe asked governors of North Dakota and South Dakota for help Monday as they face uncertainties with federal funding under President Donald Trump.
The comments came during a rare meeting that brought North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong and South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden to consult with Standing Rock Tribal Chairwoman Janet Alkire and other tribal council members.
Alkire, Armstrong and Rhoden, who convened in the council chambers of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribal Administrative Center, said they couldn’t recall the last time both governors were in Fort Yates at the same time.
The Standing Rock Reservation straddles both North Dakota and South Dakota. This puts the tribe in the unique situation of having to manage overlapping jurisdiction with both states and the federal government.
Federal spending cuts threaten several services in Indian Country the federal government is legally required to provide, including programs that support public education, health care and law enforcement, Stateline reported last month. 
Multiple Standing Rock councilors asked Armstrong and Rhoden what the tribe can do to navigate these changes.
“We all know there’s gonna be more,” Alkire said. 
Both governors said they share concerns about the cuts.
“We’re in the mode of monitoring, just like you are,” Rhoden said. 
He defended the Trump administration’s actions as necessary to bring federal spending under control.

“It’s been many decades since I felt like we had a president that’s actually looking beyond the horizon on fixing what’s wrong with America,” he said.
Alkire said she supports streamlining federal programs if it means Native nations get greater autonomy over their own resources, but she worries tribal communities will suffer if their services are cut.
“We in Indian Country have always faced underfunding, so when you cut something for us, it’s drastic,” Alkire said.
She said Standing Rock is counting on the North Dakota and South Dakota governments and their congressional delegations to make sure the federal government honors its responsibility to Native nations.
Armstrong said he hopes tribal leaders alert their state counterparts as soon as they face issues.
“When disruption happens, we need to know,” he said.
Setting the funding cuts aside, Alkire said the federal government has long neglected to address a laundry list of tribal sovereignty issues. The tribe needs more funding and staff from the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as well as fewer restrictions on access to federal land and the Missouri River, to name a few, she said.
“I told Secretary Burgum that he had his work cut out for him,” Alkire said, referring to Interior Secretary Doug Burgum, Armstrong’s predecessor as governor. 
Development was another recurring theme of the meeting.
John Pretty Bear, a district representative, asked Rhoden if he would ask D.C. to fund water infrastructure development in western South Dakota.
“It’s 2025, and we still have people that haul water,” Pretty Bear said.
Rhoden said he’s aware of the issue.
“I live in the middle of Meade County, and if you look at a water map of South Dakota as far as rural water projects, it is a black hole in that area,” he said.
Councilors also asked the governors to help support economic development on the reservation so the tribe’s younger generation can find jobs
“We need more businesses,” District Representative Joe White Mountain Jr. said. “Our kids are growing up and they don’t really have a future.”
During a January address to North Dakota state lawmakers, Alkire called infrastructure a top priority for the tribe.

Standing Rock hopes to one day build a bridge over the Missouri River connecting the reservation to Emmons County. Currently, to cross the Missouri River, Fort Yates residents must drive roughly an hour north to Bismarck or an hour south to Mobridge.
The U.S. The Department of Transportation recently awarded the tribe a $14.5 million planning grant for the project, but more support will be needed to make the dream a reality, Akire said in the address.
A bill signed by Armstrong in March authorizes the North Dakota Department of Transportation to accept ownership of the bridge if it gets built. 
Tribal officials said both states could do a better job of consulting with Standing Rock on a variety of issues, including education, transportation, gaming and land use.
Rhoden, formerly South Dakota’s lieutenant governor, assumed office at a low point for tribal relations in the state.

Leaders of all nine Native American reservations in South Dakota voted to ban Rhoden’s predecessor, Kristi Noem — now the U.S. secretary of Homeland Security — from their lands. The votes were in response to Noem’s rhetoric about Indigenous communities in the state, including an unsubstantiated accusation that tribal leaders were “personally benefiting” from Mexican drug cartels, and an assertion that Native American children “don’t have any hope.”
“I think this is an important day in our history and in the road to recovery, as far as rebuilding our relationships,” Rhoden said Monday.
Armstrong’s predecessor, Burgum, was widely regarded as an ally to the five federally recognized tribes that share land with North Dakota.
Armstrong said Burgum’s appointment to the Interior presents “unique opportunities” to the tribe, North Dakota and South Dakota, and he hopes the three governments can continue working toward their common interests.
“There’s not a lot of people that can get me out of Bismarck on less than a week’s notice when the Legislature’s meeting, but when the Chairwoman calls, we say yes,’” said Armstrong.

When a package from Amazon arrived at her Clark County home in November 2020, Michelle Vasquez-Stickley assumed it was art supplies for her 15-year-old son. She left it on his bed for him.
The package instead contained sodium nitrite, a powder that can serve as a poison antidote and, used at low levels of purity, as a meat preservative. But at high concentrations, it can be lethal.
Vasquez-Stickley’s son, Tyler Schmidt, used 99.6% pure sodium nitrite to die by suicide weeks after the delivery.
“As parents, we do everything we can to protect our children, but how could I protect Tyler from something I didn’t even know was a danger?” Vasquez-Stickley asked lawmakers in January. “The reality is, my child couldn’t walk into a pharmacy and purchase allergy medication without restrictions, yet he could buy a lethal substance online with no age verifications or warnings about dangers.”
Schmidt is one of dozens who died by this method across the country. After many warnings, Amazon stopped selling the high-purity products in late 2022, while denying wrongdoing.
In hopes of making that restriction permanent, Washington Gov. Bob Ferguson on Monday signed Tyler’s Law, a prohibition on the sale of sodium nitrite at concentrations greater than 10%. The law has exceptions for businesses that use the product.
Washington is now the fourth state to place limits on the substance, joining California, Colorado and New York.
“Tyler’s law ensures no other Washingtonian can order the deadly poison online and have it shipped to their home,” Ferguson said.
Sellers now have to label their sodium nitrite products, “WARNING DANGER: Deadly if ingested. If ingested, seek immediate medical attention for intravenous administration of methylene blue. Ingestion of sodium nitrite, even in small quantities, causes severe methemoglobinemia, extreme pain, and imminent death. Keep out of reach of children.”
Violators of the new requirements face a $10,000 fine for their first transgression, rising to $1 million for subsequent violations. The attorney general or private citizens can bring litigation to enforce the law.
House Bill 1209 passed both chambers with bipartisan support. The law takes effect immediately.
Vasquez-Stickley and Schmidt’s family were on hand as Ferguson signed the bill Monday.
“This is the kind of thing that makes a difference,” Ferguson told them. “And so I just so appreciate you having the courage to come together, to work with legislators, to work with their advocates, to bring this to public attention.”
A similar measure has seen progress at the federal level, with legislation to ban the chemical’s sale at high concentrations passing the U.S. House of Representatives before stalling in the Senate last year.
Meanwhile, the state Supreme Court recently agreed to hear one of the several cases against Amazon from families of loved ones who died after ingesting sodium nitrite.
An appeals court last year had dismissed that consolidated case, over four deaths from sodium nitrite purchased from the Seattle e-commerce giant. The judges ruled the company couldn’t be held liable for intentional misuse of its products.
Many other lawsuits against Amazon over this issue are also ongoing.
After Tyler’s Law passed the House, Vasquez-Stickley told KING 5 she hoped the bill would save lives “and prevent other families from experiencing the profound loss we have endured.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_0868-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 19:06:00.999089

(Photo courtesy of University of Iowa)A physician is suing the University of Iowa and Board of Regents, claiming disability discrimination and retaliation.
In his lawsuit, Dr. Parijat Joy says he began his affiliation with the university in 2018 as part of the school’s cardiovascular disease fellowship, after which he trained for several years as an associate physician at University of Iowa Hospitals, then was promoted to assistant clinical professor in the Department of Internal Medicine.
According to the lawsuit, Joy’s child was diagnosed in March 2019 with a neurocognitive disability that required intensive medical care out of state. Joy alleges that prompted him to request flexible scheduling that would allow time for travel. The request was met with “harassment and hostility,” the lawsuit alleges.
In September 2019, Joy alleges, he was forced to accept a nine-month leave, without pay and benefits, from his fellowship position so that he could accompany his child to a treatment center. The lawsuit alleges a program director later retaliated against Joy for exercising his rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act by denying his requested accommodations and insisting that he undergo intensive clinical rotations.
According to the lawsuit, Joy “was expected to perform at a higher level than his peers,” and was eventually accused of absenteeism. Beginning in mid-January 2021, the “campaign of bullying and harassment escalated to direct disability discrimination,” the lawsuit claims, after an accident in which Joy fractured his wrist. Joy was allegedly denied schedule modifications so his wrist could heal and was forced to work several rigorous rotations, exacerbating his injuries.
The lawsuit also claims that on March 5, 2021, the university informed Joy his contract would not be renewed the following year, falsely alleging he lacked medical knowledge, was unprofessional and was poor at communication.
The lawsuit, originally filed in Johnson County District Court and then transferred to federal court, seeks unspecified damages for violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, including discrimination and retaliation.
The state has yet to file a response to the lawsuit, and spokespeople for the Iowa attorney general’s office, University of Iowa and the Board of Regents did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/university-of-iowa-hospitals-.jpg,,,2025-04-07 19:06:00.999089

Josh Carlson, right, shown speaking with Rep. Rodney Lyons in the Louisiana House of Representatives, has filed legislation that would update the definition of coerced abortion in state law. (Allison Allsop/Louisiana Illuminator)A state lawmaker has filed a bill that would significantly expand the definition of “coerced abortion,” potentially making reproductive health laws in Louisiana even more restrictive.
The proposed legislation, House Bill 425, builds on the existing definition of coerced abortion, first approved in 2018, as one committed by a person who engages in the “use or threatened use of force, control, or intimidation” against a pregnant woman to compel her to undergo an abortion against her will. The existing law already defines this as a crime “whether or not the abortion procedure has been attempted or completed.”
Rep. Josh Carlson, R-Lafayette, who authored the bill, proposes replacing the word “intentionally” with “knowingly” and removes “physical” to describe the use of force or intimidation.    
The bill also details 18 examples of force, control or intimidation and removes references to outpatient abortion facilities.

Some of the examples of coercion are specific, such as kidnapping or blackmail, but others leave wide room for interpretation. 
One example says “restraint of speech or communication with others” can count as intimidation or control, including “interference with the use of mail, telephone, or money.” Another cites “isolation of an individual from others” or “exploitation of needs for food, shelter, safety, affection,or  intimate or marital relationships.” 
Michelle Erenberg, who leads the reproductive rights group Lift Louisiana, said Carlson’s bill is an attempt to weaponize the law. 
“The law already prohibits coercing someone into having an abortion,” Erenberg said in an emailed statement to the Illuminator. “Expanding the definition of what coercion means to include such broad categories is just another way to weaponize the law against anyone who may be trying to help someone access care. The real problem we should be trying to solve is people being forced by the state to carry pregnancies to term that they don’t want or that may threaten their health.” 

Carlson’s proposal follows last year’s creation of the new crime of coerced abortion using an abortion-inducing drug. That legislation made national headlines last year because it included a last-minute reclassification of mifepristone and misoprostol as “controlled dangerous substances,” making Louisiana the first state to classify these drugs in the same family as addictive painkillers. 
While the drugs are used for abortion, they also have many other medical uses including inducing labor and preventing or stopping postpartum hemorrhages. 
State Sen. Thomas Pressly, R-Shreveport, who sponsored the abortion drug law, declined to comment on Carlson’s bill, saying he had not yet reviewed the legislation.
Earlier this year, a grand jury indicted a Port Allen mother for allegedly giving her minor teen daughter abortion medication. The Illuminator is not identifying the mother to protect her daughter’s privacy. 
The grand jury also indicted the New York physician who allegedly wrote and shipped the prescription to Louisiana. Gov. Kathy Hochul has cited her state’s shield laws and refused to extradite Dr. Margaret Carpenter. 
The mother pleaded not guilty in March. Prosecutors have repeatedly claimed she “coerced” her daughter into taking the abortion medication by threatening to kick her out of the house if she didn’t. However, prosecutors notably did not seek an indictment related to the crime of coerced abortion, given the current definition. 
The allegations against her are covered under the expanded definition in Carlson’s bill because the incident could be considered “exploitation of needs for shelter.” 
Louisiana Right to Life told WWNO-FM its staff helped draft Carlson’s bill, claiming it’s “common ground for most Louisianians.” The anti-abortion organization, which also helped draft Pressly’s bill, has called the Port Allen case an example of why the definition of coerced abortion needs to be expanded.
Carlson’s proposed legislation would punish anyone who commits the crime with a $5,000 fine or imprisonment with or without hard labor for up to five years. 
Carlson was unavailable for an interview Monday.
Correction: This report was updated to accurately reflect the criminal charges against the Port Allen woman.

A proposal (HB 841) that would allow employees earn less than the minimum wage for work-study, internships, pre-apprenticeship programs, or “other similar work-based learning opportunities” advanced Monday in its final committee in the Florida House and will now go the floor for a vote.
The bill says that the employee’s decision to opt-out must be voluntary and that an employer cannot coerce an employee to do so or condition an offer of employment on his or her decision. The minimum wage in Florida is $13 an hour.
That dollar figure comes via a 2020 constitutional amendment that calls for raising the state’s minimum wage by $1 every year until it reaches $15 per hour in September 2026.
“An unintended consequence of Florida’s constitutional minimum wage is that it cripples an employer’s ability to provide more opportunities for unskilled workers in areas of pre-apprenticeship and education,” said Ocala Republican Rep. Ryan Chamberlain in describing his bill. “This is having an impact on our young people and those seeking retraining in other, more profitable fields of work.”
The bill says that an employee’s waiver is only valid for 12 months after the start of employment. And it says that such work-based learning opportunities may not last more than 9 months or two full-time semesters consisting of at least 15 credit hours each.
North Florida Democratic Rep. Franklin Gallop asked Chamberlain what could ensure that an employee wasn’t being pressured or coerced into “voluntarily” agreeing to work for a lower than minimum wage?
Chamberlain said it would be illegal to coerce someone “in that manner.” However, the proposal does not say who would be the arbiter, or what penalties could incur for such coercion.
The measure is supported by the business community.
“It’s a new avenue to find more qualified workers,” said Tim Nungesser, legislative director for the Florida office of the National Federation of Independent Business. “The bill is limited. The bill is voluntary. If a worker doesn’t want to participate, they don’t have to.”
‘More ways to pay less’
Paul Cox, an Orlando stagehand, said the bill asks Floridians to waive their constitutional rights to a minimum wage.
“Florida does not need more ways to pay less. Especially when a supermajority of voters passed this amendment in 2020. It needs stronger protections. Better enforcement. Better support for recognized apprenticeships and a commitment to economic fairness. Job training is valuable, but it should not come at the expense of eroding wage rights for all Floridians.”
South Florida Democratic Rep. Felicia Robinson said that in the current economic climate, “I cannot see someone working for less than the minimum wage. Period.”
The federal minimum wage is set at $7.25 an hour, a figure that hasn’t moved since 2009. The minimum wage in Florida for tipped employees is $9.98 an hour. The federal minimum for tipped workers is $2.12.
The bill passed mostly along party lines in the GOP-controlled House Commerce Committee, 14-6.
The companion bill in the Senate (SB 676), filed by Lee County Republican Jonathan Martin, has one more stop in the Rules Committee before reaching the floor of that chamber.

Senate File 167 sets the State Supplemental Aid (SSA) rate for the upcoming fiscal year. SSA is the growth rate for public K-12 school funding, allocated to schools on a per-pupil basis.
The Senate, and Gov. Kim Reynolds, had put forward the 2% SSA rate. But in February, the Iowa House returned the legislation to the Senate after increasing the SSA rate from 2% to 2.25%. The House amendment also added other funding components like a $10 increase to the state cost per pupil, changes to transportation equity aid payment and weighting for school districts with shared operational costs, as well as a one-time allocation of $22.6 million to help school districts with rising costs and the impacts of inflation.

Since the House vote Feb. 18, the measure did not seen public discussion again before Monday, April 7. Lawmakers had already failed to meet their self-imposed deadline to pass school funding within 30 days of the governor’s budget release, in addition to failing to pass the measure before school districts’ budget proposals were due in early March. However, there are still a few weeks before the school districts’ final budgets must be submitted to the state by April 30.
House Speaker Pat Grassley told reporters in several news conferences that House Republicans were committed to providing some additional funding supports for Iowa K-12 schools, components that were part of the hold-up in passing this year’s SSA rate.
“We understand that we may not get all of those things that we include in our bill, but we’d be hopeful that there’d be at least some consideration,” Grassley told reporters in late March. “Whether it’s operational sharing, whether it’s some one-time, inflationary factors — we continue to be hopeful that at some point in time enough Iowans engaging in this conversation will at least put some of those things on the table.”
The gridlock ended Monday as Senate Republicans returned with an amendment that set the SSA rate at 2%, but included some components of the House amendment. The $22.6 million appropriation was removed, and the proposed raise to the state cost per pupil was lowered from $10 to $5. While the House language gave a standing unlimited appropriation for transportation equity aid payment beginning in fiscal year 2026 to make sure the statewide adjusted transportation cost per pupil was not lower than the statewide average cost, the Senate language set a 5% rate for payments to the transportation equity fund per pupil.
Sen. Lynn Evans, R-Aurelia, said that with the amendment, the spending package represents a $238.1 million increase for K-12 schools compared to FY 2025. Of that increase, $126.8 million will go to public schools, $96.8 million to the state’s Education Savings Account (ESA) program, providing public funds for private school costs, and $14.5 million for charter schools.
Evans said that the proposal provides “responsible and sustainable funding for local school districts.” He emphasized that Republicans have steadily increased school funding in Iowa, and that K-12 spending will make up 44.7% of the state’s budget in FY 2026 at $4.2 billion.
“This bill makes a promise to local school districts that can be kept,” Evans said.
During debate on the SSA rate, Democrats have repeatedly called for their GOP colleagues — who control both chambers — to set a higher rate in 2025. The minority party argued that the 2% rate will put more than 150 Iowa school districts on the budget guarantee process, which will trigger property tax increases to meet funding obligations that the SSA rate does not cover.
Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, said Republicans’ SSA proposal was “shameful” and that the proposal will result in either higher property taxes or school staff cuts.
“This is really personal to me,” Trone Garriott said. “My kids go to one of these schools where we are going to see cuts. My school is on this list. Property taxes are going to have to go up just to scrape by. Meanwhile, parents like me get to see up close and personal, the people who are going to lose their job, the great teachers that are going to go elsewhere, the programs that are getting cut, the class sizes that are getting larger, the opportunities that are getting missed because this body and the state Legislature won’t invest in the majority of Iowa’s kids through our public schools.”
Sen. Janet Petersen, D-Des Moines, criticized the measure as a part of legislative Republicans’ and Reynolds’ larger budgeting strategy which she said prioritizes private school students through the Education Savings Account (ESA) program over the majority of Iowa students who attend public K-12 schools. The ESA program, which provides students with public funds equal to the SSA per-pupil funding rate for private school tuition and associated costs, will be open to all Iowa students with no family income limits beginning in the 2025-2026 school year.
Petersen said the governor’s five-year projections for the state’s finances show repeated dips into the state’s Taxpayer Relief Fund that she said directly align with spending on the ESA program, championed by Reynolds in 2023.
“When you look at this budget … 92% of our school-age children that go to public schools are going to get an measly increase, because you have invested millions and millions of dollars for very small number of families to receive private school vouchers and corporate tax cuts,” Petersen said. “There is still time to address that, where we could put millions more into our public school districts instead of handing them over to wealthy families who are already sending their kids to private schools, I would encourage a no vote on this legislation. It is not enough.”
Evans said the amended bill is an increased investment in Iowa’s K-12 system, and also represents a focus on keeping educational funding with K-12 students rather than with school districts.
“We believe it’s important to be honest with our school districts about the state’s finances and not overpromise,” Evans said. “This bill continues our focus of funding students over systems. This proposal continues to demonstrate our commitment to education, dedicated funding to help students in the educational setting that is best for them and will prepare them for future success.”
The legislation returns to the Iowa House.

The same review said employees with the parish jail committed fraud totaling more than $210,000. Discovery of their actions ultimately led to their arrest and prosecution.
According to the audit, JPSO received a change request for the agency’s online banking information for its sales tax revenue account. Its accounting department and tax collector bureau executive staff, not realizing the request was a bogus “phishing” scheme, made the change. As a result, wire transfers totaling $1,106,085 were made from the tax receipts fund to a bank account outside the sheriff’s office.
An investigation into the bank fraud continues, and the suspect behind the scheme is unknown, according to the JPSO. As of Dec. 30, the sheriff’s office has recovered almost $293,000 of the money taken.
Separately, a correctional officer at the Jefferson Parish Correctional Center allegedly received more than $84,000 in overtime for work he didn’t perform, the internal audit said. Curtis Lamar III, 44, of New Orleans, faces one county of felony theft. He has pleaded not guilty, and his next court date is in May, according to Jefferson Parish court records.
The other alleged scheme revealed in the audit involved a clerk at the jail who is said to have pocketed more than $130,000 from people paying cash to have someone released from the correctional center. Anetra Parker, 50, of New Orleans, was arraigned last week on a felony theft charge. Her plea was not yet posted in online court records.     
These findings were included in an internal audit LaPorte CPAs performed for the sheriff’s office covering the fiscal year that ended June 30, 2024. State law requires such audits be forwarded to the Louisiana Legislative Auditor, which released the audit report Monday.
The sheriff’s office did not immediately respond to the Illuminator’s request for comment, though the audit included brief details on JPSO’s plans to ensure the fraud isn’t repeated in the future.
With regards to online banking access, the department will implement a plan to properly confirm account change information. It will also create a more stringent overtime review process, add another layer of reconciliation for its cash bail receipts and take additional monitoring measures.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/GettyImages-1716188281-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-07 18:11:52.536464

(Stock photo by Greenleaf123/Getty Images)A multi-county court jurisdiction that saw civil and divorce trials paused for about a year because of judicial vacancies faces the risk of a similar stoppage, a top court administrator told lawmakers Monday.
The warning from Judge Michael Blee, the courts’ acting administrative director, comes as bench vacancies edge upward following a confirmation blitz at the start of 2024. There are now 49 judicial vacancies statewide, nearly 20 more than court officials say the system can handle.
Blee warned that while vacancies impose additional stresses on judges, the greater peril is for those awaiting their time in court.
“Imagine your family members are going through that process, or perhaps yourself. There’s children involved. There is no closure. Perhaps someone is in another relationship and wants to start their new life. They sit and languish,” Blee told the Assembly Budget Committee Monday.
The jurisdiction in question, called Vicinage 13, covers Hunterdon, Somerset, and Warren counties. New Jersey Supreme Court Chief Justice Stuart Rabner ordered a halt to civil and divorce trials there in February 2023 because there were not enough judges to hear them, an order he lifted in March 2024.
Only two of the state’s 49 judicial vacancies are in Vicinage 13, though Kevin Shanahan, the vicinage’s assignment judge, told lawmakers he expects at least one additional vacancy there by the start of May, with the possibility of a second judge departing early.
Shanahan warned that even a small number of vacancies could cause severe disruptions in his jurisdiction.
“In a vicinage like mine — three counties with a relatively small number of assigned judges — a vacancy in Vicinage 13 is probably the equivalent of two-and-a-half vacancies in a larger county,” Shanahan told the panel.
The Assembly, which is the first chamber to take budget testimony from the judiciary this year, plays no formal role in filling judicial vacancies. Candidates for judgeships are nominated by the governor and confirmed by the Senate.
The judges’ warnings, now delivered to lawmakers on an annual basis, are their latest call for legislators to staff up the courts. Judiciary officials have said the courts can operate sustainably with up to 30 vacancies. Blee on Monday said the courts could “could live with 25” vacancies.
Senate President Nicholas Scutari (D-Union) last March declared the state’s yearslong judicial vacancy crisis was at an end after numerous confirmations in early 2024 brought judicial vacancies down from 58 at the start of that year to 39.
But the pace of confirmations has slowed significantly in the intervening months. Senators confirmed two dozen judges between May 20, 2024, and the Senate’s most recent voting session on March 24. They confirmed the same number of judges between Jan. 1 and April 9 of last year.
The Senate Judiciary Committee, which must advance judicial nominations before they come to a vote before the full Senate, is not scheduled to meet in April, which legislators typically devote to budget hearings.
At least four judges are anticipated to leave their posts in May, a court spokesperson told the New Jersey Monitor.
The growing number of vacancies could waylay an effort to bring the judiciary’s backlog down to prepandemic levels.
Pandemic disruptions and judicial vacancies catapulted the number of backlogged cases to 97,028 in the fall of 2021. The courts have made significant progress in reducing the backlog, which fell to 41,433 in February, according to a courts website. 
“We have staff, judges constantly looking at our cases constantly trying to determine oldest to youngest, prioritizing, trying to move things,” Blee said. “It’s a difficult task, but it’s something — as I mentioned: Justice delayed is justice denied.”
The court marks a case as backlogged if the matter has not been heard within a period of time set by the judiciary. The length of that period varies depending on the type of case.

Laura Kelly, pictured here in February 2023, announced Monday she vetoed legislation that eliminates protections for LGBTQ+ youth in Kansas' foster care and adoption systems, but Republicans, who could override the veto later this week, say the bill expands religious expression for adoptive and foster care parents. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly vetoed a bill that bans policies requiring adopted and foster parents to affirm a child’s sexual orientation or gender identity if it conflicts with the parents’ religious or moral beliefs.
House Bill 2311 would forbid the secretary of the Kansas Department for Children and Families from placing children in homes based on a guardian’s beliefs on sexual orientation or gender identity, which opponents said could leave LGBTQ+ young people in Kansas’ foster care system vulnerable to prejudicial households. The legislation also would allow people to sue DCF for damages and attorney fees if barriers to foster care or adoption were enforced after July 1, when the bill was set to go into effect. 
The governor said Monday the bill detracts from the state’s “best interest of the child” standard.
“Children in need of care already face unique and complex challenges. I will not sign legislation that could further complicate their lives,” Kelly said in a news release. “I also have concerns that this bill could expose the state to frivolous lawsuits and hinder the agency by taking time and resources away from critical services.”
Republican leadership saw the bill differently, characterizing it as a way to ensure foster parents aren’t discriminated against for their religious beliefs. 
In a joint statement, House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican, and Senate President Ty Masterson, an Andover Republican, called the veto “perplexing” because, in their view, the legislation would extend First Amendment protections to foster parents. 
The veto cannot stand, they said.
“Our foster care system depends on strong and stable families to care for the children in our system,” they said. “The last thing any administration should be doing is discriminating against qualified families due to their religious and moral beliefs.”
The bill has been framed as a freedom of religious expression issue, but it also targets LGBTQ+ children in the state’s foster care and adoption systems. Proponents argued religious foster parents shouldn’t have to bury their beliefs to adopt or act as foster parents, but opponents say LGBTQ+ kids in the foster care system deserve loving, accepting families. 
House Minority Leader Rep. Brandon Woodard, a Lenexa Democrat, thanked Kelly for the veto, describing the bill as “potentially harmful” because it would “allow adoption and foster care agencies to prioritize religious beliefs over the best interests of children.”
LGBTQ+ youth report disproportionately higher rates of depression, suicide and bullying than their peers. The Trevor Project, one of the nation’s leading LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, conducts an annual national survey on the mental health of LGBTQ+ youths, which in 2024 showed that  63% of LGBTQ+ young people surveyed in Kansas said they’ve been discriminated against because of their sexual orientation or gender identity in the past year.
“LGBTQ+ young people who reported living in very accepting communities attempted suicide at less than half the rate of those who reported living in very unaccepting communities,” the organization’s 2024 survey found.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The Nebraska statehouse is set to debate a bill and perhaps a related constitutional amendment Tuesday seeking to alter how the state awards Electoral College votes for president.  
Legislative Bill 3 was pushed out of the Government, Military, and Veterans Affairs Committee on March 10, after pressure from the governor, whose political future with President Donald Trump could depend on whether he delivers winner-take-all. Despite this week’s political theater and pressure from state and nationwide Republicans, the bill and the separate constitutional amendment are likely dead on arrival.

State Sen. Loren Lippincott of Central City is unlikely to have the 33 votes needed to overcome a promised filibuster. The same holdouts from earlier in the legislative session haven’t budged from opposing the change. As of Monday afternoon, Lippincott said he doesn’t yet have the votes for LB 3. 
“I have not seen any change, but I remain hopeful,” Lippincott told the Nebraska Examiner.  
Nebraska is one of just two states — Maine is the other — that parcel out some electoral votes to the winner of the presidential popular vote in each congressional district. The district approach, adopted in Nebraska in 1991, has led to Democrats claiming a single electoral vote from the Omaha-based 2nd Congressional District three times — in 2008, 2020, and 2024. Republicans have won the rest, including two for winning statewide.
The Nebraska Democratic Party, which has dubbed the 2nd District the “Blue Dot,” calls LB 3 and the related constitutional amendment an attempt to “suppress the voices of Nebraskans” and said it would “work hard to ensure this bill fails.” Some rural Republicans have shared concerns about one day losing “their voice” under winner-take-all as the state becomes more urban and suburban over time.
Political theater meets vote reality
Gov. Jim Pillen is using the same tactic he did with the Government Committee, which he pressed to advance the bill to the floor for debate. On Thursday, he released a statement on X saying all Unicameral Republicans need to “stand together as a team.” Republicans hold 33 of the 49 seats in the officially nonpartisan Legislature.
“President Trump has called for the restoration of WTA, as have the majority of Nebraskans across our state.” Pillen wrote in the post. “I call upon our Republican Senators to answer this call and vote to advance WTA. In particular, I hope that veteran Senator Merv Riepe stands with his fellow Republicans on this critical issue.”

State Sen. Merv Riepe of Ralston, who often proves a pivotal vote on controversial legislation, has been the loudest holdout on winner-take-all. He was one of the holdouts Trump called in 2024, when the then-presidential candidate was trying to convince senators to support Pillen’s 11th-hour push for winner-take-all.
Two months before the 2024 election, Pillen held a meeting on winner-take-all at the Governor’s Mansion with at least two dozen Republican state senators about securing support and trying to convince holdouts. The push was killed by then-State Sen. Mike McDonnell of Omaha, a former Democrat and union leader who had pledged when he changed parties and became a Republican to keep the status quo but flirted with changing his mind. McDonnell decided not to support the change, saying he didn’t want to disrupt the money and attention that presidential politics brings to the Omaha area. He has since been term-limited from office and lost a recent primary bid for Omaha mayor.
With McDonell term-limited and replaced by State Sen. Margo Juarez of Omaha, Riepe is taking the brunt of the political pressure this go-round. He reaffirmed his stance and intent to vote against the bill and the constitutional amendment during a mini press conference Thursday, saying his voters had expressed their appreciation for how the state stands out because of its electoral system.
“I feel like my family name is on the line,” Riepe told reporters.
  State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont. Feb. 11, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
State Sen. Dave Wordekemper of Fremont, who voted to advance the bill out of committee, is also likely to vote no but has expressed interest in letting the voters decide via the proposed state constitutional amendment, LR24CA. State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams has proposed that approach, which the committee also advanced to the floor. LR24CA is not scheduled for debate Tuesday but could be discussed as a potential fallback position. 
“At minimum, WTA deserves a fair up-or-down vote on its merits by the people’s representatives, not to be smothered by a filibuster led by ultra-liberal Democrats,” Pillen said in last week’s statement. 
Another indicator of the bill’s difficult path is that Speaker John Arch of La Vista announced he is limiting floor debate on LB 3 to four hours Thursday, because most members have already determined how they will vote. Typical bills are given eight hours on the first round of debate. 
“I do not believe a drawn-out eight-hour debate benefits this body or anyone on either side of the issue,” he said.
State Sen. Danielle Conrad of Lincoln has already filed motions to indefinitely postpone, bracket, and send the bill back to committee before Tuesday’s debate, a hint that Democrats and others opposed to the change are prepared to follow through on a promised filibuster.  
State Sen. John Cavanaugh of Omaha told Nebraska Public Media that the LB 3 debate would be a waste of time because the proposal lacks support. 
“The people in the state of Nebraska have been clear that they like the system that we use,” Cavanaugh said. 
 Maine offsetting Nebraska

Recently, a Democratic state lawmaker in Maine proposed a bill in their state’s Legislature that would move Maine back to winner-take-all if Nebraska switches as a way of “protecting” Maine’s voices and voters.

Riepe said that Maine’s push to change the system would offset any “advantage” Republicans would gain if Nebraska switched to winner-take-all. He added that he wished more states did their Electoral College system by district because “it’s closer to a popular vote.”
 “I’m not ready to give up on that,” Riepe said. 
The state’s Republicans have pushed for winner-take-all for decades. The effort gained new steam after Trump and surrogates expressed support during his 2024 campaign. Now, with Trump back in the White House and his grip on GOP politics strengthened, people in Pillen’s orbit have said he wants to make sure Trump does not endorse Trump donor and friend Charles Herbster in the 2026 GOP primary for governor if Herbster runs. 
Pillen defeated Herbster in the 2022 GOP primary for governor despite Herbster having Trump’s endorsement. But he had help from then-Gov. Pete Ricketts, now a U.S. senator. 
Debate over LB3 is set to begin by 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current) The Massachusetts company accused of illegally dumping contaminated soil during construction of the Route 6/10 Interchange in Providence five years ago says it is the unwitting victim of a scheme involving extortion and bribery orchestrated by a now-defunct competitor.
That’s according to a lawsuit filed March 27 in Providence County Superior Court by Canton-based Barletta Heavy Division Inc., which claims the company was sabotaged and now no longer able to obtain work in Rhode Island.
Barletta put the blame mainly on Stephen Cardi, the former treasurer of the defunct Cardi Corp., along with International Union of Operating Engineers Local 57 President Jim White. The company claims the two men bribed workers to defame and destroy its reputation, violating state racketeering laws.
“In conspiracy with Cardi, Local 57, upon information and belief, implanted certain loyalists on Barletta job sites to cause chaos, create disruption, and to otherwise sabotage projects and taint Barletta’s reputation as a general contractor,” the lawsuit claims.
Cardi and White did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
Barletta is requesting the Superior Court find Cardi and Local 57 liable for trespassing, tortious interference, and violating the state’s racketeering law. The Massachusetts contractor also seeks monetary damages, though the lawsuit does not state how much Barletta has lost out as a result of the alleged conspiracy.
Tortious interference is the legal term for intentionally damaging someone else’s contractual or business relationships with others, causing economic harm.
In January 2023, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha charged Barletta with two counts of illegal disposal of solid waste, one count of operating a solid waste management facility without a license, and one count of providing a false document to a public official.
Contaminated fill from the Boston and the Pawtucket/Central Falls Transit Center was allegedly used in the ongoing $247 million highway project near Providence’s Olneyville neighborhood, according to the AG’s office.
That felony case remains ongoing in Providence Superior Court, where a trial is tentatively set to start June 9.
Barletta’s 6/10 project former superintendent pleaded guilty in federal court in December 2022 to three counts of making a false statement in connection with a federally funded highway project. He was sentenced to one year probation and ordered to pay a $40,000 fine. 
In April 2023, Barletta signed an agreement to be voluntarily excluded from bidding on federally funded projects while criminal charges were pending in court.
Barletta claims it honored its contractual obligations and permit granted from the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management (DEM) and that the soil did not contain levels of contamination exceeding the state’s standards.
Complaints over the soil surfaced in the summer of 2020 after workers voiced concerns about excessive dust. A test paid for by Local 57 found toxins at unacceptable levels.
Barletta claims state officials determined the soil posed no threat to public health. DEM spokesperson Kimberly Keough deferred a request for confirmation to the state’s Department of Health, whose spokesperson acknowledged Rhode Island Current’s inquiry
Barletta said such tests were done because White allegedly trespassed to collect soil samples, which were then analyzed under the guise of residential and/or home purposes. The company claims the testing and alleged trespassing was done by White and Cardi to create conflict with Barletta’s contracts and relationships with owners, according to the lawsuit.
Barletta claims the controversy surrounding the 6/10 project harmed its reputation and prevented it from obtaining new work in Rhode Island, including damaging its prospects in rehabilitating the westbound Washington Bridge.
Barletta’s lawsuit claims Cardi had told company leaders that he would instruct Local 57 to make the soil controversy “go away” if it withdrew its bid to renovate the westbound section of Intestate 195 during the initial bid process in 2020.
Cardi Corp. won the contract, but the state put the project back out to bid after the Federal Highway Administration refused to sign off on the agreement. The award was then given to a joint venture between Barletta and Warwick-based Aetna Bridge Co. — the most recent contractors to work on the bridge’s rehabilitation before the state closed down the highway in December 2023 because it was at risk of collapse.
Barletta is among 13 contractors the state is suing for doing negligent work on the westbound Washington Bridge. Seven defendants, including Barletta, tried to get the case dismissed, but Judge Brian Stern denied their petitions on Feb. 27.

Laura Kelly signed several bipartisan bills, including House Bill 2107, which offers Kansans a process to recover damages from wildfires and fires caused by electric public utilities.
The state faces higher wildfire dangers this year with a weak La Niña weather system, according to a Kansas State University agronomy report. The state tends to see almost triple the number of acres burned during La Niña weather systems than El Niño.

“Kansas is no stranger to the risks and impacts of wildfires,” Kelly said in a press release. “The changes included in this bill will help better prepare utility companies to identify and mitigate wildfire risks. By taking reasonable measures, we can better protect Kansans and provide a path to recover from the financial impacts of wildfires.”


HB 2107 also sets up a legal structure to allow Kansans to pursue compensation for damages from a wildfire or fire event determined to be caused by a utility provider. Claims under the bill must be made within two years of the date of damage.


“HB 2107 will ensure that utilities will be able to identify cost-eﬀective strategies for wildfire preparedness and implement solutions that protect Kansas communities while maintaining aﬀordable energy for consumers,” said Rep. Leo Delperdang, R-Wichita. “Like any other business, utility companies must be able to operate with a strong but fair legal climate that provides recourse for those damaged but also protects against excessive verdicts that could negatively impact the financial health of an industry crucial to Kansas residents, businesses, and industry. House Bill 2107 effectively balances those interests.”


In an effort to better prepare the state and Kansas communities for wildfires, the bill also requires the Kansas Corporation Commission to convene a workshop on wildfire risks, utility readiness to mitigate wildfires, risk mitigation strategies and cost recovery for the impacts caused by wildfires.


In addition to HB 2107, Governor Kelly also signed the following bipartisan bills:


House Bill 2120: Authorizes the State Board of Regents to sell and convey certain real property on behalf of Kansas State University and Kansas State University Veterinary Medical Center.


House Bill 2109: Exempts public utilities from civil liability relating to the attachment, access, operation, maintenance or removal of law enforcement equipment on structures owned by the utility.


House Bill 2052: Streamlines the process for an individual with a provisional concealed carry license to request a standard license and addresses requirements that specifically identify off duty law enforcement officers that are conceal carrying. Off-duty law enforcement officers, who are allowed to carry a concealed handgun into any building where they could carry if they were in uniform, would not have to give personal information to anyone in the building requesting or requiring it.


House Bill 2040: Extends the time the Kansas Corporation Commission has to make a final order on a transmission line siting application, from 120 days to 180 days. This allows time for additional landowner and stakeholder input.


House Bill 2037: Updates membership of the Council on Travel and Tourism from 17 entities to 20, with three appointees being made by the governor from the National Independent Venue Association, the Kansas Museums Association and the Kansas Sampler Foundation.

When he brought back it back to Montana, he was slapped with a $308 tariff for the equipment, part of an expansive array of tariffs ordered by the Trump administration. On Friday [&#8230;]","Photo illustration by Getty Images.When a wheel broke on Jonathan St. Goddard’s tractor in late March, the nearest replacement he could find was in Saskatchewan for $1,253. When he brought back it back to Montana, he was slapped with a $308 tariff for the equipment, part of an expansive array of tariffs ordered by the Trump administration.
On Friday in federal court, St. Goddard, along with state Sen. Susan Webber, D-Browning, filed a lawsuit in federal court asking a judge for an injunction against Trump’s tariffs on Canada, arguing that it violates the treaty rights of Indigenous people across the nation, and saying that only Congress can approve tariffs, not the president, according to the U.S. Constitution.
The lawsuit centers on the Jay Treaty signed in 1794, ratified by Congress and signed into law by then-President George Washington, which exempted tribes along the United States-Canadian border from being taxed or levied on goods between the nations. The lawsuit, filed in the Great Falls division of Montana’s federal courts, says that the 49th parallel, the longest continuous running border in the world between two nations, bisects more than 30 tribes whose ancestral lands span both countries. In addition to the Blackfeet tribe, other tribes split by the border include the Lakota, Salish, and Iroquois.
Montana has 14 border crossings with Canada, spanning three provinces, British Columbia, Alberta and Saskatchewan.
The lawsuit asks the court to halt the tariffs that affect Canada, or if not, declare that the emergency orders that implemented the tariffs be declared void for tribal members because they violate the 1794 treaty rights, which were ratified by Congress.
“The imposition of universal tariffs in the Canada Orders is an unconstitutional attempt by the executive to regulate commerce and violates plaintiffs’ constitutional and treaty rights,” the lawsuit said.
St. Goddard and Webber are being represented by Missoula lawyer Monica Tranel.
But the lawsuit doesn’t just focus on the treaty rights, it also challenges the Trump administration’s ability to use emergency powers to impose tariffs. Trump has declared that the fentanyl drug crisis at America’s borders have forced a national emergency.
“The plain language of the (International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977) does not include the power to ‘tariff’ or to ‘tax.’ The powers enumerated in the statute are extensive and specific. Omission of tariffs is significant given how clearly Congress referenced tariff authorities in other trade statutes. The IEEPA has been the basis for over 60 executive orders. It has never been used to impose tariffs,” the court filing said.
The lawsuit said that only Congress has the power to negotiate treaties and trade agreements.
While the Trump administrations has used the fentanyl problem to impose the tariffs, the lawsuit also contends that the tariffs have not targeted the problem. For example, Customs and Border Patrol intercepted 9,600 kilograms coming from Mexico, but only 19 kilograms of fentanyl from Canada.
“The executive orders do not address the differential or attempt to target the harm, they simply impose blanket tariffs on all borders without reference to the factual situation or any attempt to explain how universal tariffs, which are functioning like sanctions, will actually address the stated emergency,” the lawsuit stated.  “There is no link between the stated national security threat of imports from steel and aluminum and a 25% tariff on all goods, including a replacement tractor wheel necessary to continue farming and ranching.”
The lawsuit also said that Montana’s tourism and agricultural sectors will be harmed by the tariffs, two key industries for the state, and essential to Montana’s tribal nations.
“Tourism reservations are cancelled, contracting jobs are off, farm and ranch operations have been thrown into high unpredictability, and businesses cannot plan,” the lawsuit said. “The growing, tourism, and construction season is short in Montana. It cannot withstand see-saw tariffs that are on one day and higher the next.”
Montana Farmers Union filed a declaration in favor of the lawsuit, saying that tariffs had the ability to hurt the farming and ranching community because of the trade between Canada and Montana, especially in the northern part of the state.
“Many Montana farmers’ closest suppliers and buyers are just across the Canadian border. Farmers are going to get caught both ways by tariffs on both side of the borders instead of being able to rely on the historical network of businesses and family that have helped to spread their risk and workload,” said Walt Schweitzer, executive director of the Montana Farmers Union.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/GettyImages-158909292-1024x680.jpg,,,2025-04-07 18:11:52.536464

The state Senate on Monday voted 32-15 to defeat House Bill 1259 that would have eliminated seasonal time changes. 
Just before the vote to kill the bill, it was amended to put North Dakota on year-round daylight saving time.

Supporters of using daylight saving time cited advantages for evening recreation and construction. Some construction projects are not allowed to start before 7 a.m. 
There also were concerns in border cities with North Dakota being on a different time than its neighbors. 
The bill was amended to take effect only when neighboring states also had dropped the time change.

,DC,2025-04-07 21:33:26+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Markets worldwide take another dive as Trump threatens higher tariffs on China,Ashley Murray,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/markets-worldwide-take-another-dive-trump-threatens-higher-tariffs-china,,"WASHINGTON — Global markets plummeted Monday for the third consecutive trading day since President Donald Trump announced his “Liberation Day” tariffs — and the administration gave mixed signals on meeting other nations at the negotiating table.U.S. stocks reacted positively to a short-lived, incorrect report amplified on social media that Trump may pause the tariffs for 90 days, but the market plunged quickly when the White House dismissed the claim as “FAKE NEWS.”Any upward progress was erased upon Trump’s announcement that he planned to further punish China starting Wednesday.At about 11:15 a.m. Eastern Trump threatened to raise tariffs on China a further 50% if the country does not back down on its retaliatory 34% tax on U.S. imports by Tuesday. If left unresolved, the latest U.S.-China trade war will hit American farmers, particularly soybean producers.Writing on his platform Truth Social, Trump said “Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.”The administration maintains more than 50 countries have reached out to negotiate.U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent wrote on X that Trump has tasked him to negotiate with Japan, which could face a 24% levy beginning Thursday.“Japan remains among America’s closest allies, and I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies. I appreciate the Japanese government’s outreach and measured approach to this process,” Bessent wrote on the social media platform.“China has chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behavior,” Bessent added.European Union’s stanceMeanwhile, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she has offered the U.S. zero-for-zero tariffs on industrial goods.“But we are also prepared to respond through countermeasures and defend our interests,” von der Leyen said Monday at a press conference.Trump slapped a 20% tax on goods from the EU, set to take effect Thursday, on top of 25% tariffs on steel and aluminum that began in mid-March. A 25% tariff on all foreign cars imported to the U.S. also launched Thursday.The EU is poised to impose retaliatory duties on American products in response to the import taxes. The bloc of 27 nations is scheduled to vote Wednesday on a list of U.S. goods to be taxed at its borders.When asked by reporters in the Oval Office Monday if the EU offer was enough to scale back the tariffs, Trump said “No, it’s not.”Journalists had gathered in the Oval Office for Trump’s meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who visited to discuss Trump’s new 17% tax on his country’s imports.Netanyahu promised to “eliminate” his country’s trade deficit with the U.S.""We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do and we're going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers that have been put up unnecessarily. And I think Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,"" Netanyahu said.When asked by reporters if he intends to lower the tariffs on Israel, Trump said, “Maybe not.”“We give Israel billions of dollars a year,” he added.The meeting was streamed on C-SPAN.‘Let’s take the deal’Two Republican senators publicly urged Trump on social media to take the EU offer.Sen. Mike Lee of Utah wrote, “Let’s take that deal! Much to gain.”“Totally agree,” Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin replied. “At some point you have to take YES for an answer.”Another Senate Republican, Ted Cruz of Texas, has publicly criticized Trump’s steep levies on almost every nation around the globe.A bipartisan effort to claw back power from the president’s near-unilateral authority to impose tariffs might not get far, despite the economic uncertainty unleashed since Trump unveiled his “Liberation Day” plan.Legislation co-sponsored by Democrat Maria Cantwell of Washington and Republican Chuck Grassley of Iowa would require the president to notify lawmakers prior to new tariffs from the White House and limit the levies to a 60-day window unless Congress approves an extension.Senate Majority Leader John Thune of South Dakota seemed to shut down the idea Monday, according to reporters on Capitol Hill.“I don’t think that has a future. The president has indicated he will veto it. I don’t see how they get it to the floor on the House,” Thune told Politico.A companion bill in the House is sponsored by Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska.Chances of House Speaker Mike Johnson bringing the bill to the floor are likely slim, as the Louisiana Republican supported Trump’s tariff unveiling in person last week.",,,,2025-04-07 18:11:52.536464

(Photo by Marco Lozzi for Utah News Dispatch)In the hallway to former congresswoman Mia Love’s memorial on Monday, dozens of pictures immortalized countless moments of a full life; they show her hugging her children, marrying her husband Jason, giving speeches at rallies, and being unable to contain laughter.
Love was the first Black Utahn to be elected to the U.S. Congress after a career in local politics in Saratoga Springs. That made her name widely known in national politics. However, as those photos reflect, Love’s family and friends remember her as the best friend, mom and aunt, and strong, influential figure for those around her.
She died on March 23 at 49 after fighting brain cancer for three years. As hundreds gathered in a Latter-day Saint chapel at the University of Utah’s Institute of Religion for a public funeral, many speakers’ voices cracked as they remembered stories of her life and some of the last moments they shared with Love. They also tried to honor her request to keep moments of glee in her memorial.

Former Utah Rep. Mia Love, America’s first Black Republican congresswoman, dies of cancer at 49

“Mia and I periodically spoke about this moment and the potential of one of us dying early. And as we considered the possibilities again, she would take a jab at me and say, ‘look at how well my family is aging. Remember Jason, black don’t crack,’’ Jason Love said on Monday morning prompting some laughs. “But she made it very clear to me and to our family that she wanted this moment to be a time of celebration.”
And while, inevitably, there were some tears, Love’s family and friends spent the morning quoting her jokes and full extracts of her book “Qualified,” in which she spoke about her story as a daughter of Haitian Immigrants in New York and Connecticut. She recalled how her diverse background gave her a valuable voice, not only for issues that affect minorities, but for all issues and how women, and Black women in particular, should pursue opportunities often taken by white men.
Jason Love remembered how after 11 weeks of radiation and chemotherapy, Love insisted on recording the audio version of that book, a now on-repeat staple in his routine.

“Whether in an elected position or lobbying for policies outside a formal office, I found power in my story, and cannot help but to share it,” Mia Love read in her audio book in a special note for people in minority communities. “The United States of America needs your voice and needs to hear your stories. You are qualified. Find your voice, lead with character and empower others to do the same.”  



Let us know what you think...


 


Love first learned about her brain tumor after experiencing migraines and excruciating pain during a family trip in Puerto Rico. After getting back to Utah, she was diagnosed with glioblastoma, a highly malignant type of brain cancer. Then, doctors said she would live for 10 to 15 months.
“Mia fought cancer valiantly, and this week marks her third year anniversary from her diagnosis,” Jason Love said. “She doubled the life expectancy, in typical Mia Love fashion.”
On March 1, Love’s daughter Abigale shared in a post on X that her cancer wasn’t responding to treatment and was progressing, making her family shift her focus from treatment to enjoying their remaining time together.  
Hundreds come to honor Mia Love ahead of funeral

Many have since gathered at public tributes, including a viewing memorial at the Utah State Capitol on Sunday, in which her husband and children, Alessa, Abigale and Peyton greeted guests ahead of the Monday funeral as Love lay in state. After the service, there was a military service outside the chapel, with a presentation of the American flag in front of Love’s casket. 
Lt. Gov. Deidre Henderson witnessed all services from a prime spot. She and Love were close friends, bonded amid campaign conversations and a shared love of the state and the country, Henderson said during the Monday ceremony.
Henderson remembered Love’s clear instructions on how to best help her during her illness.

“‘I’m in fight mode,’ she told us, ‘and what I need from you all, more than anything, is to help me fight it. This is a campaign, and we are going to win. Fight with me. Run with me. Climb that summit with me.’” Henderson said. “And so our job was clear, no doom and gloom, no tears, although we cried many, just not in front of Mia.”
Among all speakers in the service, there were other stories representative of Love’s character; when she was mayor, she made the newly appointed Saratoga Springs city manager carry her purse around as a joke. She also made Lt. Gov. Henderson buy heels in a Tampa store ahead of her speech in the Republican National Convention, which, she indicated, “had to be tall” and had her daughter recite the pledge of allegiance in front of every American flag they encountered when she was a toddler.
Her family and friends also emphasized the message she aimed to spread during her time in public office. 
“Mia’s work is unfinished. It is. And she wanted each of us here today to join her. The adversaries of freedom and righteousness seek to divide us through the natural seams of our fabric of society. They know that if they apply a little bit of pressure to these natural seams of race, of religion, of gender, of income, they know that they can get us divided and they can weaken us,” Jason Love said. “Mia and I believe that there has never been a greater time on this earth in the history of humanity. Let’s listen to what Mia said.”

Anna Paulina Luna struck a deal this weekend to avoid a floor vote that likely would have changed the chamber’s rules and given new parents the ability to vote by proxy for 12 weeks.Johnson and Luna, both Republicans, plan to use “vote pairing” — where two members on opposite sides of an issue agree to cancel out each other's votes, typically because one lawmaker cannot make it to the floor to vote — rather than move forward with a bipartisan proposal to allow new parents to vote remotely.The deal represented progress for Johnson, who saw the issue torpedo the House agenda last week, though Democrats weren’t on board as of Monday.“Speaker Johnson and I have reached an agreement and are formalizing a procedure called ‘live/dead pairing’—dating back to the 1800s—for the entire conference to use when unable to physically be present to vote: new parents, bereaved, emergencies,” Luna posted on social media.While GOP lawmakers could pair with other members of their own party if they planned to vote differently on a bill, the plan would likely need Democratic buy-in to work on party-line votes.Democrats disappointedColorado Rep. Brittany Pettersen and California Rep. Sara Jacobs, both Democrats, issued statements expressing disappointment with Luna for no longer pushing forward with the discharge petition that was set to force a floor vote this week on the rule change.“When Speaker Johnson refused to bring our resolution to the floor for a vote — regardless of how many Members supported it — we followed the rules and tried to force a vote by filing a discharge petition and received the necessary signatures to bring it forward,” Pettersen wrote. “Instead of letting us vote, he has instead gone to historic lengths to kill our resolution and make sure the large majority of his Members don’t have a voice. Let’s be clear: these changes are not a win for us and Speaker Johnson has turned his back on moms and dads in Congress and working families.”Jacobs wrote the agreement Johnson and Luna reached wouldn’t “support new parents so they can do their jobs and vote on behalf of their constituents while also taking care of themselves and their families.""“I won’t accept the way Congress has always done things, and the American people won’t either,” Jacobs wrote. “We will keep pushing for innovative ways to support young people and parents in Congress – including by modernizing how we vote – even if it takes a Democratic majority to do so.”Jacobs, Luna, Pettersen and their allies from both parties were able to defeat a maneuver from Johnson last week that would have set aside their discharge petition. In response to the defeat, Johnson sent the House home for the week on Tuesday.Floor vote avoidedHad Luna and Johnson not struck a deal this weekend, House rules would have allowed her to force a floor vote this week on the bipartisan Proxy Voting for New Parents Resolution.The discharge petition to bring it up for a vote held signatures from 218 House members, indicating it had the support needed to change the chamber’s rules.House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said during a press conference Monday that he “hadn’t had the opportunity to fully evaluate this proposal and/or talk with Rep. Pettersen or Rep. Sarah Jacobs, who have been the leaders of this effort on our side.”“And so I’m going to refrain from commenting on the proposal until I’ve had those conversations and the opportunity to review this so-called agreement,” Jeffries said, before adding he didn’t understand why so many GOP lawmakers were opposed to allowing proxy voting for new parents.“The question has to be raised: What is the Republican problem with allowing expectant mothers or new mothers to vote on behalf of their constituents?” Jeffries asked. “This seems like a very strange hill for them to die on legislatively.""",,,,2025-04-07 18:11:52.536464

Frederica Wilson wants to examine conditions at a Miami immigrant detention center, saying she’s concerned about reports of people sleeping on concrete floors.
Wilson, who represents part of Miami-Dade County, sent a letter Monday to Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem requesting her help in arranging a congressional visit this month to the Krome North Service Processing Center.
“I have heard directly from immigration lawyers about the unacceptable conditions at Krome, including reports of individuals sleeping on the concrete floor, detainees being deprived of adequate food, and female detainees being held in a facility designated for men,” Wilson wrote in her letter. “These alarming accounts illustrate the urgent need for me to exercise my duty of congressional oversight and intervention.”
Wilson led a visit to Krome during President Donald Trump’s first term in 2019.
The request followed reports that Felipe Zapata Velásquez, an immigrant on a student visa enrolled at the University of Florida, was arrested on March 28 and taken to Krome for driving with an expired license and registration tag, according to The Independent Florida Alligator.
Zapata Velásquez did not appear in the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement online detainee locator system as of Monday afternoon. His mother told Colombian news outlet NTN24 that the student, who had been in the country for six years, had opted to self-deport after immigration officials said he would remain detained while making his case in court.
Gainesville Democratic state Rep. Yvonne Hinson called the arrest saddening.
“Did registration and an expired license fall under the scope of arrest and detainment? After 3 Special Sessions on Immigration and cases such as this, immigrants are under attack now more than ever. We must speak up and not allow this to continue without voicing outrage,” she wrote in a press release.

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services on Friday announced that Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is touring “various locations in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico” between Monday and Wednesday.
The announcement, billed as part of Kennedy’s efforts to “fulfill President Trump’s promise to Make America Healthy Again,” doesn’t specify where in New Mexico he is visiting.
When Source NM asked for more information about Kennedy’s stop in New Mexico, the department said, “There will be no events open to the press in New Mexico.”
On Monday, the department said in a news release that Kennedy would appear on Tuesday morning at a “fireside chat” during the 2025 Tribal Self-Governance Conference in Chandler, Arizona.
Also on Monday, the New York Times published an article centered on Native leaders’ criticism of Kennedy for his reassignment of high-ranking federal health officials to Indian Health Service locations in western states.
The article quotes Deb Haaland, former interior secretary for President Joe Biden, congresswoman, Laguna Pueblo member and Democratic candidate for governor of New Mexico, as saying, “It’s terrible, it’s shameful and it isn’t right.”
Source NM on Monday morning reached out to spokesperson for Haaland’s campaign but had not heard back as of publication time.
New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez last week joined other state attorneys general in a legal challenge against Kennedy and the department’s decision to pull $11 billion in Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grants for infectious disease research, including approximately $60 million to the New Mexico Department of Health.
Democratic U.S. Senator for Hawai‘i Brian Schatz, vice chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, said Monday that IHS plays a critical role delivering health care to Native communities, and Kennedy’s reassignments do not “look like a serious plan to do that,” and “clearly did not involve Tribal consultation.”
“If this administration truly cared about fixing IHS’s staff vacancy crisis, why did it try to cut the IHS workforce by nearly 1,000 employees just months ago?” Schatz asked in the statement. “Why is it pushing to cut Medicaid, a critical funding source for IHS, to pay for tax cuts for billionaires? And why did it give high-level career employees just hours to decide whether to uproot their lives for jobs they never applied for in places they do not know?”
Schatz added that if the Trump administration actually wants to support IHS, it should ask tribal governments about what their communities need, “not use them as political pawns in its effort to purge the federal workforce in the name of so-called government efficiency.”

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Senate bills limiting virtual school days and expanding school tutoring are a crucial step closer to becoming law after passing the first House committee stage on Monday.
A House subcommittee focused on education funding approved a lengthy slate of bills in its final meeting of the 2025 legislative session. The bundle of bills now advances to the House Appropriations and Budget Committee for consideration.
The panel advanced one of the Senate’s priority education bills, Senate Bill 758. The legislation would limit public schools to two virtual learning days per academic year, if the state superintendent approves the district’s online instruction plan or if the governor issues a state of emergency in the district.
The bill originated from Sen. Kristen Thompson, R-Edmond, and the Senate’s top lawmaker, President Pro Tem Lonnie Paxton, R-Tuttle.
The House’s No. 2 Republican leader, Speaker Pro Tem Anthony Moore, R-Clinton, presented SB 758 to the subcommittee.

“If we’re serious about actually educating our kids, they need to be in chairs with qualified professionals to help them understand what they’re learning, and that’s the only way they’re going to learn and grow,” Moore said while debating in favor of the bill.
The subcommittee’s two Democrats, Rep. Michelle McCane and Rep. John Waldron, both of Tulsa, voted against the measure. 
McCane said some guardrails on online school days are appropriate but found the limitations in SB 758 too narrow. Waldron said the Legislature should address Oklahoma’s teacher shortage first.
The bill passed 7-4, with dissenting votes from two GOP members — Rep. Toni Hasenbeck, R-Elgin, and Rep. Ronny Johns, R-Ada. Neither spoke against the bill.
The subcommittee advanced another bill that could extend students’ time in classrooms. SB 409 would require districts to add a school day for every increase of $25 million the Legislature adds to the education funding formula, which is the chief driver of state appropriations to public schools.
The panel’s chairperson, Rep. Chad Caldwell, R-Enid, said the bill would ensure students benefit from future funding increases. 
The bill’s senate author, Education Committee leader Sen. Adam Pugh, R-Edmond, said at the beginning of the legislative session that he filed the bill with the hope of boosting education funding by $125 million, thereby adding another five days to the school year.
Bills to fund tutoring programs advance
Another bill from Moore would dedicate funds for students who need extra help in math. SB 215, called the Oklahoma Math Achievement and Proficiency Act, would require students in second through fifth grade to take three math screening tests each school year. 
Children testing above their grade level would have the option to take an advanced math program. 
Schools would have to develop a math intervention plan, involving remediation and tutoring, within 30 days of a student scoring below grade level.
The bill would cost between $10.2 million and $13.2 million, according to a fiscal impact estimate from House staff. Improving math skills in Oklahoma’s future workforce is worth the investment, Moore said.
National testing found 31% of Oklahoma fourth graders scored proficiently in math and 23% in reading. By eighth grade, levels dropped further to 17% proficiency in math and 20% in reading.
The subcommittee approved the bill with an 8-2 vote.

McCane and Waldron cast the only two votes against the legislation after voicing concerns of adding to teachers’ workload and affording the bill in a tight-budget year.
The two Democrats also were the only to oppose a new K-8 high-dosage tutoring program outlined in SB 245. The bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, advanced from the House subcommittee 8-2.
The legislation from Sen. Dusty Deevers and Rep. Toni Hasenbeck, both Republicans from Elgin, is expected to cost $7.18 million. 
The bill would pay teachers or hired contractors $1,600 for each cohort of students they tutor per semester in reading or math. Tutors could earn $1,000 for every grade-level increase that each student improves.
Waldron and McCane questioned whether the tutoring sessions would match the quality and methods of instruction provided during school hours.
Hasenbeck said the program would complement Moore’s math achievement bill.
“This bill meets the kids where they are and teaches them the skills they need to have,” she said during Monday’s meeting.
Legislation would improve college access
Two bills earned unanimous support from the subcommittee. 
SB 140 would extend the application window for the Oklahoma’s Promise Scholarship to Dec. 31 of a high school student’s senior year. Students must apply by the end of 11th grade under current law. There is no fiscal impact estimate for the bill.
SB 235 would offer matching funds to districts that give financial aid to employees working toward a college degree in education. These initiatives, known as Grow Your Own Teacher Programs, help aspiring teachers graduate from college and achieve a teaching certification.
The expected fiscal impact from the bill is $5.2 million, said its House author, Rep. Dell Kerbs, R-Shawnee.

The Republican also reiterated a controversial call to consider abolishing the agency that is tasked with preserving the state’s forest and is responsible for wildland fire detection.

Stitt said only “half” of the Forestry Service’s resources were deployed during the state’s worst wildfire outbreak, which he described as “the perfect storm of high winds, low humidity and drought conditions.”
Nearly 158 wildfires swept across the state beginning March 14, killing four and destroying more than 500 homes, including a ranch Stitt owned.
Stitt said Monday that he asked Mark Goeller, the head of the Forestry Service, to “step down” so there could be “a fresh set of eyes” and so the state could “take decisive steps to prevent a tragedy like this from happening in the future.”
Goeller has denied wrongdoing.
“The Agency to which I dedicated over 40 years of my life was said to have performed poorly,” Goeller wrote March 30 on social media. “Preparations were made well in advance, the public was notified of the impending fire danger, firefighting resources were ordered and in place.
“Nothing was held back as the events of the 14th and following days unfolded.”
Stitt last week first suggested abolishing the Forestry Service and providing funds directly to local fire departments, a plan that was swiftly panned by lawmakers on both sides of the aisle. 
Several high-ranking lawmakers were highly critical of the suggestion. Many have voiced support for Goeller.
Stitt said he has asked his secretaries of agriculture and public safety, Blayne Arthur and Tricia Everest, respectively, to “assemble a report detailing where our response failed and what can be done to improve that response in the future.”
The report will be completed within a week, he said.

PCBs are a group of man-made chemicals that were previously used in manufacturing products ranging from coolants and lubricants to caulks, paper products, sealants and electrical equipment. They were banned as the chemicals are toxic and can accumulate in organisms, building up in living things over time and passing up through the food chain as other organisms consume contaminated plants and animals. 
 “While PCBs are thankfully no longer manufactured in the United States, their harmful effects continue to contaminate our natural resources, wildlife, and communities,” Nessel said in a statement. “The manufacturers responsible for this damage should be held accountable, not Michigan taxpayers. Pursuing this litigation will ensure that those who profited from the manufacture and sale of these chemicals and who hid the known toxicity and negative impacts of their use are held liable for the lasting damage they caused.”

The state has pursued and secured remediation and restoration work at sites where PCBs were used and released into the environment at unsafe levels, and issues Eat Safe Fish guidelines to help protect Michiganders from exposure to PCBs and other chemicals. 
However, Nessel’s office said there are areas where too little work — or no work at all — is being done to clean up PCB contamination and restore the state’s resources.
The Department of Attorney General is seeking proposals from attorneys and law firms with experience and interest in pursuing constitutional, statutory, tort and other applicable common law claims against manufacturers of toxic chemicals that ended up in the environment. 
Contracts will be awarded based on the best value to the state, considering qualifications, experience, abilities, capacity and cost-effectiveness. Nessel will make the final decision based on recommendations from department staff in order to ensure an objective selection process and maintain bidder anonymity.  
The Department of Attorney General will post a notice to its website when the selection has been made. The selected law firms will be compensated on a contingency basis.
More information on how to submit a proposal is available at the Department of Attorney General’s website. The deadline for submissions is May 5, 2025.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/DSC_0901-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

Crawford’s victory gave the Court’s liberals control [&#8230;],"Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley. (Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Wisconsin Supreme Court Justice Rebecca Bradley said this week she’ll seek another 10-year term on the Court next year. 
Bradley’s announcement came just days after Dane County Judge Susan Crawford defeated Waukesha County Judge Brad Schimel by 10 points in the most expensive judicial campaign in U.S. history. Crawford’s victory gave the Court’s liberals control of the majority until at least 2028. Bradley told WisPolitics that she will run again to “ensure that there is a voice for the constitution and for the rule of law to preserve that in the state of Wisconsin.”
“I’m concerned for what an extremely radical court is going to do over the next three years, and I will be spending the next several weeks assessing what happened on Tuesday and figuring out a path to achieving a court that is not led by and dominated by the radical left, that gets back to deciding cases under the law and respecting the constitution,” Bradley said. 
Liberals have now won four of the last five state Supreme Court elections, all by double digits. The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel reported that appeals court judge and former Democratic lawmaker Chris Taylor is considering challenging Bradley in next year’s race. 
Schimel and former Justice Dan Kelly have lost the last three Supreme Court elections after arguing that their liberal opponents are partisan ideologues seeking to legislate from the bench.
Bradley was first appointed to the Court by Gov. Scott Walker in 2015 and elected to a full term in 2016. In recent years she’s been one of the Court’s most right-wing justices. 
In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, she compared restrictions put in place to prevent the spread of the disease to the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II and she sided with President Donald Trump in his unsuccessful effort to have the Court throw out the results of the 2020 election. 
She has often written in her dissents against Court decisions about her belief that the liberal majority is acting politically and said the Court’s liberals are “pursuing a political agenda.”

(Henry Redman/Wisconsin Examiner)COLUMBIA — The state Department of Motor Vehicles has fixed a glitch in its system that automatically disqualified 17-year-olds from registering to vote, ending a legal fight with the state American Civil Liberties Union, the civil rights group announced Monday.
Under state law, teenagers who will turn 18 by Election Day can register to vote up to 13 months in advance. One way of doing so would be for teens to check a box while applying for a driver’s license saying they want to register.
But the state DMV’s system was set up to filter out applicants who weren’t already 18 when they clicked the button, regardless of whether or not they would be old enough to vote by the election. The system did not forward the information of more than 17,000 teenagers to the State Election Commission who would have been eligible to vote by Election Day but didn’t tell them that, according to the state ACLU.
Nearly 1,900 of those teenagers didn’t register any other way, meaning they were out of luck when it came time to vote in November, attorneys for the DMV said previously.
Judge rules against adding 1,900 teens to the voter roll by Election Day

The issue prompted a lawsuit from the ACLU, which unsuccessfully asked a Richland County judge in October to add those voters to the rolls. The group dropped the case in December. But in a March 26 letter, an ACLU attorney threatened to file another lawsuit in federal court arguing the DMV had violated a 1993 federal law requiring the agency help people register to vote.
By that point, the DMV had already fixed the problem, attorney Erin Baldwin said in a March 27 letter to an ACLU attorney.
“Please know that our agency moved as quickly as possible with a very old computer system to achieve the reprogramming necessary to accomplish this goal,” Baldwin wrote in the letter provided to the Gazette.
The DMV will collect information from anyone 16 and older who selects that they would like to register to vote, which it will then send to the state Election Commission. The Election Commission can then register voters who will turn 18 by the election and save the information of those not yet eligible to be registered, Baldwin wrote.
“The SCDMV will continue to work proactively with the State Election Commission to ensure we meet all requirements established in law for voter registration,” DMV spokesman Mike Fitts said in an email.
The ACLU, along with the state League of Women Voters and NAACP, celebrated the change as a win for voters’ rights.
“This victory is a powerful reminder that voting rights are for all,” Brenda Murphy, president of the state NAACP chapter, said in a statement. “When young people have access to the ballot, they drive real change.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/electionday2022-009-1-1024x6831742327334-1.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

(Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer)Funding for a nonprofit run by controversial north Minneapolis pastor Jerry McAfee was cut from the latest version of a Senate budget bill after Reformer reporting showed McAfee had been a legal client of Senate President Bobby Joe Champion. 
Champion’s legal work for McAfee, which he said was pro-bono, concluded just prior to the start of the 2023 legislative session, when he successfully steered $3 million in public funds to McAfee’s group.
Last week, Champion introduced another bill allocating $1 million to 21 Days of Peace, the violence prevention group founded by McAfee. That funding has not made it into the current version of the jobs bill being debated by lawmakers.
Starting in 2022, Champion, in his private capacity as an attorney, represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four court cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties, totaling roughly half a million dollars. McAfee refused to tell the Reformer whether he paid Champion for the legal work, but has since told KARE-11 that Champion charged him “not a quarter.”
At the Jobs and Economic Development Committee hearing Monday, Champion told his colleagues that he has no private legal contracts with any of the remaining organizations receiving funding through the bill. 
“One of the challenges that you always have when you live in a community is that you know lots of people, and people always try to make connections in more ways than one,” he said. “I want to assure you I am not representing anyone that is outlined on our sheet, not pro-bono, not for a fee, nothing.”
He further lamented that “one of the most challenging things, always, is when someone seeks to smear your name and come up with what’s written in papers.”
Champion has asked the Senate Subcommittee on Ethics to issue an advisory opinion on whether his actions on behalf of McAfee’s group represented a conflict of interest that should have been disclosed under Senate rules. “There’s no conflict from my vantage point,” he told colleagues on the Jobs and Economic Development Committee.
He has temporarily stepped down as chair of the ethics subcommittee, and has been replaced by Sen. Sandy Pappas, DFL-St. Paul.
Senate Republican Leader Mark Johnson, R-East Grand Forks, told reporters at the Capitol Monday that it was “appropriate” for Champion to step down from the ethics committee, and that Republicans are considering whether to file a formal ethics complaint.
“We want to delve into this one deeply, because we cannot have members of the Senate, the members that people have voted for public trust in, to have any sort of color of misappropriation of dollars or conflicts of interest,” Johnson said. “And this clearly looks like that on the face.”
He also said Senate Republicans will be looking at ways to tighten rules around legislatively named grants, which lawmakers can allocate directly to nonprofits and other organizations with minimal oversight.

In a 2-1 decision Friday, a state Appeals Court panel agreed with Republican Appeals Court Judge Jefferson Griffin that the state Board of Elections should not have counted votes from more than 60,000 people whose registration showed up as incomplete in the state’s database or from more than 5,500 military and overseas absentee voters. 
Griffin is trying to unseat incumbent Democratic Supreme Court Justice Allison Riggs. He trails by 734 votes. Her lead was confirmed in two recounts. He wants votes thrown out so he can win the seat. 
The Appeals Court said the elections board should be required to notify voters Griffin is targeting that their ballots need to be corrected if they want them to count. Voters would have had 15 business days from the time notices were sent to either complete their registration with a partial Social Security number or a partial driver’s license number, or, if they were military or civilian overseas absentee voters, to supply a copy of a photo ID.
After Griffin filed his challenges, many voters came forward to say the identification numbers they provided on their registration forms did not show up in the database due to mismatches or typos. 
The electronic portal most overseas voters use provides no means of submitting ID with their ballots.  
Riggs and the Board of Elections asked for a temporary stay of the Appeals Court order. 
In his motion, Riggs’ lawyer emphasized the confusion the 15-day deadline would cause. 
“It is impossible to predict the full scope of confusion that could result from this 15-day cure process if implemented before this Court’s review,” the petition says. 
“Further, the Court of Appeals’ “cure” remedy will be inadequate to prevent the disenfranchisement of thousands of North Carolina voters. There can be no doubt that tens of thousands of voters—through no fault of their own—will be unable to cure their registrations or ballots in time.”
Griffin’s lawsuit is headed to the Supreme Court, where Republicans hold a 5-2 majority. Riggs has recused herself. 
Three of the Republican justices, in previous decisions in the case, have expressed support for Griffin’s positions. In the case of a 3-3 tie in the Supreme Court, the Appeals Court decision would stand.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Griffin-and-Riggs.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

(Gary Kramer/U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)

Washington’s wolf population is down for the first time since resident packs were confirmed to be returning to the state about 16 years ago, new figures show.
The state and tribes counted a minimum of 230 wolves in 43 packs as of Dec. 31, 2024. That’s compared to 254 wolves in 42 packs the previous year. At least 37 wolves died or were killed in the state last year, according to the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife report.
Most of the decrease was on the Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation land in northeast Washington, where the wolf count decreased by 20, from 59 to 39. In the rest of the state, it slipped by four from 195 to 191.
Eighteen of the dead wolves were hunted legally on Coleville land. One was killed legally by Spokane tribal hunters. And seven wolves were poached in incidents under investigation.
“This year, I don’t feel like our mortality was up a lot from previous years,” statewide wolf specialist Ben Maletzke said during a Fish and Wildlife Commission meeting on Saturday, where he presented the report. Though he did call the unlawful wolf killings “concerning.”
The state figures show that about three-dozen wolves were killed or died each year in 2022 and 2023. In the five years leading up to 2022, annual deaths ranged from 12 to 30.
Maletzke noted that the state’s wolf population has been on an upward trend, averaging about 20% growth annually since 2008, even when factoring in last year’s decline.
“The number of packs increased in the North Cascades in 2024, and both the North Cascades and Eastern Washington Recovery regions continued to meet or exceed recovery objectives for the fifth year in a row,” he said in a statement.
Still, wildlife advocates voiced concern, highlighting a drop in packs with breeding pairs last year to 18 from 24 in 2023. 
“It’s infuriating to see this dramatic decline in both the wolf population and successful breeding pairs, but it’s not shocking given the significant uptick in wolf killings over the past several years,” said Amaroq Weiss, a senior wolf advocate at the Center for Biological Diversity. 
Wolves were once common in Washington, but are believed to have been mostly killed off in the state around the 1930s after they were heavily hunted for their hides and under government-sponsored programs to control them.
In 2008, a resident pack was documented in Okanogan County. Wolf numbers have been climbing since. 
There are long-standing tensions over how the animals are managed, which typically pit wildlife advocates against ranchers and others who argue that the wolves are a threat to livestock. 
Last year, the Fish and Wildlife report shows that the agency carried out four wolf killings after the animals had conflicts with livestock. A fifth wolf was killed when it was “caught in the act” attacking livestock.
Another wolf was killed by a cougar, one died after eating plastic.
Wolves are protected under the federal Endangered Species Act in the western two-thirds of Washington. They are covered statewide under the state’s endangered species law. Killing one of the animals without authorization can carry penalties of up to a year in jail or a $5,000 fine under the state’s law.
Last summer, the Fish and Wildlife Commission narrowly voted against downlisting wolves from “endangered” to either “threatened” or “sensitive,” moves that would have led to lower penalties for poaching and slightly easier access to permits to kill wolves that attack livestock.
“The 2024 report vindicates the Commission’s decision to maintain wolves as a state-endangered species,” said Dr. Francisco Santiago-Ávila, science and advocacy director for Washington Wildlife First.
Santiago-Ávila raised the prospect that the Trump administration could roll back federal protections for wolves. “Washington’s wolves need more protection, not less,” he said.
The Washington Cattlemen’s Association did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
The latest wolf population report from the department said last year’s report contained errors related to the wolf count on Confederated Tribes of the Colville Reservation land. Five wolves killed by hunters on tribal land were not recorded in the earlier report. 
Corrected figures indicate that the Strawberry Pack should have been tallied as having three, not eight wolves. After factoring in an estimate for lone and dispersing wolves, this brought the overall 2023 wolf population figure to 254. It also decreased the number of breeding wolf pairs in the state by one.
While wolf populations have grown in eastern Washington and the North Cascades, no packs are currently residing in the Cascades south of Interstate 90 or on the Olympic Peninsula.
The state classifies these parts of the state as a single wolf “recovery region.” The report notes that at least three wolves known to have moved into the area have been killed unlawfully and no wolves were documented in these parts of the state by the end of last year.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/gray-wolf-1024x602.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

John Sauer argued that, despite the government’s admitted error in deporting Abrego Garcia, the lower court does not have the jurisdiction to order the Trump administration to return someone who the administration argues is no longer in U.S. custody.The appeal to the high court came within minutes of an appeals court panel unanimously upholding the order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who set a deadline of midnight Monday for the administration to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.Despite being granted legal protection from deportation by a judge in 2019, immigration officials detained Abrego Garcia and sent him on a March 15 deportation flight to El Salvador, where he was incarcerated at the notorious prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.‘The government screwed up’A panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador was a major misstep.“The United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process,” two judges on the panel, Robert B. King and Stephanie D. Thacker, wrote.King was appointed by former President Bill Clinton and Thacker was appointed by former President Barack Obama.“The Government’s contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” they wrote.J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his option that “[t]here is no question that the government screwed up here.”He noted that President Donald Trump’s administration has not made an effort to rectify its mistake.“The facts of this case thus present the potential for a disturbing loophole: namely that the government could whisk individuals to foreign prisons in violation of court orders and then contend, invoking its Article II powers, that it is no longer their custodian, and there is nothing that can be done. It takes no small amount of imagination to understand that this is a path of perfect lawlessness, one that courts cannot condone,” Wilkinson said.Order to returnOn Friday, Xinis ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia.The Department of Justice quickly appealed the decision and Xinis issued a scathing 22-page order Sunday that cited records and official statements from Trump officials saying the administration has the power to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.“Neither the United States nor El Salvador have told anyone why he was returned to the very country to which he cannot return, or why he is detained at CECOT,” she wrote. “That silence is telling. As Defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador—let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere.”Abrego Garcia was on one of three deportation flights to CECOT on March 15. Two flights contained 238 Venezuelans who were deported under a wartime law that is currently being challenged in another court case.Xinis slammed the Trump administration for arguing that she had no jurisdiction to order Abrego Garcia’s return.“For the following reasons, their jurisdictional arguments fail as a matter of law,” she said. “Further, to avoid clear irreparable harm, and because equity and justice compels it, the Court grants the narrowest, daresay only, relief warranted: to order that Defendants return Abrego Garcia to the United States.”She noted that the two countries have an agreement to house more than 250 deported men at CECOT.The U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to detain the men at the prison. Trump is scheduled to meet with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on April 14.In response to the district court’s order to return Abrego Garcia, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, posted a GIF of a confused cartoon bunny on social media.Attorney placed on leaveThe Department of Justice attorney who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, Erez Reuveni, was placed on indefinite administrative leave over the weekend.U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a Fox News interview Sunday that Reuveni was placed on leave because he did not “vigorously” defend the administration.Reuveni, a veteran government attorney, has argued for the DOJ over the course of four administrations.During Friday’s hearing he was candid that the Trump administration had provided him little information on why Abrego Garcia could not be returned to the U.S. and that “the government made a choice here to produce no evidence.”",,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

(Photo: Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Amid a growing measles outbreak in other parts of the country, Maine legislators heard testimony on Monday from parents, educators, and medical professionals on a proposal to repeal the state’s vaccine requirements.
The hearing reflected a sharp divide: some Republican lawmakers and parents called for reinstating religious exemptions, while health care professionals urged the state to maintain strict immunization rules to protect public health, especially in light of the anti-vaccine rhetoric of the federal government.
“It’s frightening to see that the purveyors of these falsehoods are now in positions of authority in Washington,” said Dr. Sydney Sewall, a longtime pediatrician in Hallowell, said in an apparent reference to U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. “Their misleading statements, which generally amplify the risks of vaccines and downplay the dangers of these diseases, have given strength to the anti-vaccine movement.”
Two bills — LD 727 by Rep. Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon) and LD 174 by Rep. Gary Drinkwater (R-Milford) — would reinstate nonmedical exemptions for school-required vaccines, six years after that provision was repealed. Supporters of the legislation raised concerns about vaccine ingredients and enforcement, particularly regarding immigrant students. Opponents, including doctors, school nurses, and public health officials, pushed back with scientific evidence and public health data showing that Maine’s stricter vaccine policy has worked. Since the 2019 law ending religious and philosophical exemptions, the state’s vaccination rate has risen from about 94 to 97%—enough to surpass the 95% herd immunity threshold.
Public health advocates also pointed to Mainers’ support for the law in a 2021 referendum, when voters rejected an attempt to reinstate nonmedical exemptions. Dr. Puthiery Va, director of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention, cited the ongoing measles outbreak in Texas — now affecting 22 states — as a clear warning.
“The elimination of these requirements not only threatens the health of students, but also increases the likelihood of school and community outbreaks, disrupting education, creating an unnecessary burden on our health care system and financial burden,” Va said.
Experts also cited the measles outbreak, which has resulted in two deaths, as an urgent reason to double down on vaccination requirements.
“While the science supporting vaccines hasn’t changed — we still consider them to be safe and effective — the danger facing unprotected children seems to have escalated,” Sewall said.
Drinkwater argued that Maine’s law is “not neutral,” and that religious exemptions to vaccines were protected by federal civil rights. A handful of parents and students who chose to leave public schools because of the vaccine requirements supported both bills, citing the sacrifice that unvaccinated children had to make to miss out on school and learning, as well as isolation from their peers due to being unable to participate in school sports and other activities.
“When they passed the law and I no longer had teachers around to help me, it became a struggle with my math skills,” said 14-year-old Caliope Murray-Trefts, who had to leave school when the vaccine requirements took effect.
“When I think about school now, I think how unfair it is … that I can’t do any of that.”
School nurses highlight vaccine requirements for immigrant students
Some lawmakers and speakers, including Rep. Barbara Bagshaw (R-Windham), a member of the Education Committee, claimed there is a double standard for immigrant students.
“If our children have to be vaccinated, there’s not the same standard for people coming from other countries that don’t have the same requirements,” Bagshaw said. “We’re not enforcing that they take the same vaccinations.”
But school nurses working in diverse districts — including Portland and South Portland — disputed those claims in public testimony and interviews with the Maine Morning Star. They explained that schools follow the same immunization process for all students, regardless of immigration status or where they moved from: schools review vaccination records and work with local public health networks to get students up to date, following Maine’s 90-day compliance window.
“There is absolutely no difference” between immunization requirements for immigrant students and students who move from other U.S. states, said Becky Bell, a registered nurse with Portland Public Schools. Immigration status, she told the committee, “has no bearing on whether they get immunized.”
In fact, most immigrant students who move to Maine are already fully vaccinated, according to South Portland school nurse Mary Robbins and guidance clerk Natalie Dunn, who monitor immunization records in the district.

(Courtesy of Preble Street)Both lawmakers who want to limit and expand General Assistance agree that the program is vital but isn’t working as is.
“For some, life’s burdens may feel overwhelming, leaving them vulnerable and isolated. It’s in these moments that the true strength of a municipality is revealed, not just in the policies they enact but in the genuine care that they offer,” said Rep. Rachel Henderson of the state’s assistance program, which helps municipalities pay for basic necessities for those who can’t afford them.
However, the Rumford Republican added, “Moderating these assistance programs is also imperative. It ensures that the resources are allocated effectively and equitably, reaching those who need them the most.”
Henderson was among the legislators who presented a total of ten bills proposing changes to General Assistance — expansion, restriction, altering municipalities’ responsibilities — to the Legislature’s Health and Human Services committee on Monday. 
Gov. Janet Mills’ administration opposed essentially all, however Mills has been pushing her own version of the limits she’d like to see placed on the program. 
General Assistance has already been the focus of much debate this session 
Mills, a Democrat, proposed limits to the program in her initial plan for the supplemental budget. The Democratic majority incorporated some limits, though not as sweeping as the governor requested, but the supplemental budget ultimately failed to pass due to Senate Republican opposition. 
Limits to General Assistance weren’t included in a two-year budget the majority passed last month, which largely continued funding government services, though General Assistance restrictions are expected to be considered in another budget bill that will be focused on policy. 
Maine is one of 25 states that operate a GA program. These programs vary in structure and administration, and Maine is an outlier in using a municipality-based matching formula. In Maine, municipalities and tribes determine eligibility based on state law and municipal ordinances, and pay 30% of eligible expenditures, while the state reimburses the remaining 70%.
Ian Yaffe, director of the Office for Family Independence, told the committee that absent additional reforms, the GA program is expected to grow beyond $20 million, double the current baseline of $10.4 million, in the next fiscal year. 
While community housing and homelessness organizations testified in support of proposals to expand the program, Yaffe argued none are tenable given the current reality of the project state budget deficit. 
But the administration is also opposed to legislation that seeks to limit the program, citing court precedent that struck down similar restrictions in other states and the challenges with mandating work as a condition of eligibility for welfare.
Restrictions 
Three of the proposals heard Monday would place further limits on General Assistance, including a plan from Sen. Sue Bernard (R-Aroostook) that includes the exact changes Mills initially proposed. 
LD 1066 would cap housing assistance, except for temporary housing and emergency shelters, to a maximum of three months per household over one year. It would also limit municipalities from exceeding the maximum levels for all assistance categories for no more than 30 days per household over one year.
While those aspects of LD 1066 mirror the governor’s proposal, Yaffe said the department is opposed because of the bill’s mandate on workfare — requiring recipients capable of working to do so  for the municipality or a nonprofit as a condition to receive assistance — something that is currently optional and used by fewer than 10% of municipalities. 
Portland officials defend General Assistance amid push to cut spending

“Workfare participants must not replace the employment of regular municipal or nonprofit employees and participants still require supervision, which may take municipal staff away from their regularly scheduled tasks,” Yaffe said. “Additionally, many municipalities are avoiding this type of workfare due to liability concerns.”
House Minority Leader Billy Bob Faulkingham (R-Winter Harbor) proposed an alternative type of limit in LD 1274, capping the state reimbursement to any single municipality to 50% of the total state funding allocated for General Assistance in any given year.
Citing Portland’s high spending compared to other municipalities, Faulkingham said the municipalities outside of Maine’s largest city are left with insufficient resources. 
“The fact that one city can consume such a disproportionate share of state resources is not only inefficient, but unfair,” Faulkingham said. “This cap will encourage municipalities like the City of Portland to explore other methods of assisting residents in need, such as private donations, local initiatives and increased collaboration with nonprofits.”
The Mills administration is opposed because the bill is an unfunded mandate, Yaffe explained. 
“A decrease in reimbursement will not negate the actual need of individuals but rather shift the burden to that municipality’s local taxpayers or neighboring communities,” Yaffe said.
LD 1046, sponsored by Tracy Quint (R-Hodgdon), would establish a 180-day state residency requirement for the program.
“Our state should not be a destination point for those seeking to abuse our kindness and goodwill,” Quint said. “No part of the state should be able, through their local unsustainable misappropriation, be allowed to plunder state resources in flagrant disregard to the harm caused to the financial stability of our state.”
Testifying in opposition, Yaffe pointed to several court cases that have defended citizens’ rights to travel and to relocate without forfeiting their rights to public assistance. 
Maine’s biggest cities seek higher reimbursements, more coverage
Two bills seek to increase the state reimbursement from 70% to 90%: LD 453, sponsored by Sen. Joseph Baldacci (D-Penobscot), and LD 1029, sponsored by Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland). 
The senators represent two municipalities, Portland and Bangor, that have the largest General Assistance costs. City leaders and district attorneys have previously told the Legislature that this disproportionate spending is by design, given that most mental health and substance use treatment centers, as well as homeless shelters, are located in or near larger cities. 
Baldacci and Talbot Ross also think it’s due to inadequate reimbursement rates overall. 
“The financial burden caused by the current reimbursement rate is too large a barrier for most municipalities to overcome,” Talbot Ross said. “As such, far too often we see people leaving their natural support systems and their own communities of origin to access resources and larger service center communities.”

Baldacci said property tax payers currently bear the burden of the 30%.
“I am sure the state has saved tens of billions of dollars from this, but it’s only come at the expense of property taxpayers in Bangor and all over the state,” Baldacci said. “This bill is in part to bring some sanity back to this program. If there are regulations or restrictions that the Legislature wants to impose on General Assistance, those can be debated and discussed.”  
Community housing and homelessness organizations favor Talbot Ross’s plan because it goes farther, requiring that the maximum General Assistance level sufficiently accounts for housing assistance while also ensuring adequate eligibility for other necessities.
Annika Moore, advocacy team leader for Preble Street, which provides services to people experiencing homelessness, said as rents have increased people reach the maximum assistance level with housing payments alone. Moore provided an example of one of Preble Streets’ clients, who uses her entire General Assistance benefit to cover rent for a modest one bedroom apartment and has essentially no other possessions aside from donated food. 
Illustrating to lawmakers the inadequate funding that exists to meet needs, Katie Spencer White, president and CEO of the Mid Maine Homeless Shelter and Services in Waterville, said Sunday night her shelter provided emergency housing to 90 people. A bank released $100,000 of the organization’s line of credit Monday, she said, but she expects to need to take out another $100,000 next month. 
Shelters can’t charge people for stays, which is the underlying idea of presumptive eligibility, the assumption that a person in emergency shelter is eligible for government assistance unless proven otherwise. 
Currently, state law requires a person’s eligibility to be redetermined after 30 days. LD 1029 would increase that to 180 days, which White said is more reasonable. 
“Allowing shelter providers more time to work with clients, many of whom are in crisis and experiencing trauma that results in behavior and emotional reactions, including anxiety, fear and difficulty concentrating, will make sure the system serves the people it intends to serve,” White said.
The change would also help agencies like hers hire staff to submit invoices, “Because, believe it or not, we are a business, and if it costs more to submit the invoice than we receive in revenue, we will not submit the invoice.”
Other proposed expansions focused on the services eligible for reimbursement by General Assistance. 
LD 657, sponsored by Rep. Abden Simmons (R-Waldoboro), would designate broadband and internet as basic necessities under the program.
“By adding internet services to the General Assistance program, it would help them to not miss important doctors appointments,” Simmons said, explaining that he introduced the bill on behalf of a constituent who had this challenge. “In areas of the state with aging communities like mine, this desperately is needed.”
However, Yaffe said the program is meant to meet immediate, short-term needs, whereas he described broadband and internet services as ongoing needs. 
LD 1017, also sponsored by Talbot Ross, would add the cost of food provided or served at emergency shelters to the reimbursement, as the system currently reimburses shelters for the cost of issuing food vouchers but not providing meals themselves. 
Yaffe argued providing this assistance to shelters wouldn’t be consistent with the primary purpose of the program, which is to provide direct assistance to individuals.
Municipal responsibilities 
The Mills administration testified neither for nor against one bill, LD 1081, which would adjust part of a law passed last year that required a staff member be available to accept and process General Assistance applications during all regular business hours of a municipal office. 
LD 1081, sponsored by Rep. Melanie Sachs (D-Freeport), would change statute to require each municipality to designate daily hours for accepting and processing General Assistance applications, which can’t be less than 50% of the municipality’s regular business hours. 
“Freeport has struggled to comply with this requirement,” Sachs said, explaining that Freeport Community Services terminated its contract with the town last summer due to a lack of capacity, increased applications and case complexity. 
While Sachs said she doesn’t want to make it harder for applicants, she wants to make sure communities can provide the service. The Mills administration seemed to agree.
“The department believes that this bill strikes the right balance between ensuring access to the GA program and alleviating the burdens of program administration, particularly in smaller municipalities,” Yaffe said. 
LD 1178, is intended to “add some teeth” to the statute that deals with municipal responsibilities, said bill sponsor Rep. Suzanne Salisbury (D-Westbrook). It would expedite the process of determining when a municipality illegally moves a person to avoid the responsibility of administering General Assistance and adds penalties for doing so.
While some social services workers viewed this as a more effective alternative to the bill that proposed residency requirements, Yaffe said the data the state has about these conflicts demonstrates it’s not a major issue. 
Yaffe said the questions submitted to the program’s hotline, which is available to GA administrators or members of the public, regarding municipality of responsibility only accounted for 132 requests or about 2% of the total last year, with most requests being for guidance and not actual disputes between towns. 
While pointing to those figures, the lack of comprehensive data overall about the program remains an issue. 
Henderson proposed LD 637, which would direct the Maine Department of Health and Human Services to evaluate if it’s feasible to upgrade the program database to include information about whether a disqualified applicant is seeking assistance in another municipality.
“I don’t want to speak negatively of a very valuable General Assistance program that our municipalities provide,” Henderson said, adding that she has personally experienced poverty and homelessness. “I think one of the hardest things to see is when there’s such a negative outlook on people who reach out for help and seek help.”
Henderson said her bill would maximize the impact of the program’s funding and foster trust in the community as residents see that support is being directed to those who truly need it. 
However, Yaffe said such a report would duplicate requirements already in law — and requirements that the Mills administration has recently found it is going to be unable to execute. 
In August, the department solicited requests for proposals to build a technology platform for General Assistance program evaluation but received bids between $752,000 to $5.8 million for the initial two-year period to build the system.
“Given the current fiscal reality and ongoing increases to cost within the GA program, the department is not able to absorb these costs into department resources as it had originally intended,” Yaffe said, adding that the department will be submitting a revision to current statute to clarify what it can accomplish within existing resources, or to delay the system until funding is available.

Second, the threats to non-human, yet still essential, research subjects similarly rings in irreparability,” Kelley wrote, referring to research animals. “Finally, the potential loss of human capital and talent to virtually every Plaintiff poses yet another harm incapable of run-of-the-mill legal relief.”Kelley added the “Court is hard pressed to think of a loss more irreparable than the loss of a life, let alone the thousands of people who are counting on clinical trials as their last hope.”The case began in February after the NIH announced it would cap Facilities and Administrative fees for every institution receiving a grant at 15%, a significantly lower threshold than many research universities and medical schools had negotiated over the years.That led to three lawsuits — Commonwealth of Massachusetts v. National Institutes of Health, Association of American Medical Colleges v. National Institutes of Health and Association of American Universities v. Department of Health & Human Services — all of which are before Kelley.Facilities and Administrative fees, also referred to as indirect costs, cover expenses that are not associated with one specific research project.

Sharice Davids of Kansas are uneasy about proposed fees for container ships uses to import and export agriculture goods.,"Kansas Farm Bureau president Joe Newland, a former Kansas House Republican, said the state's agriculture economy could be harmed by a plan of the Trump administration to impose massive fees on container ships relied on to export Kansas farm products and import fertilizer and other inputs. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — The Kansas Farm Bureau president expressed skepticism Monday about the U.S. trade representative’s plan to impose U.S. docking fees of as much as $1.5 million on Chinese-built ships operating in international water to haul Kansas farm products to market or deliver key inputs for crop production.
U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer proposed the policy as part of President Donald Trump’s objective of diverting container ship construction from China to the United States.
The administration’s policy could impact Seaboard Corporation, a Fortune 500 company based in Merriam, Kansas, that operated Seaboard Marine, a large international shipping carrier. Kansas farmers rely on global shipping to import fertilizer or seed and to export crops. In 2022, Kansas exported $7.2 billion in agricultural products.
“We support efforts to increase America’s competitiveness in shipbuilding, but the USTR’s existing plan would raise shipping costs, destroy jobs and make Kansas agricultural products less competitive in global markets,” said Joe Newland, president of Kansas Farm Bureau.
He said steps should be taken to make certain U.S.-owned shipping companies and their customers, which included the state’s farmers and ranchers, weren’t “caught in the crosshairs of misguided policy.”
U.S. Rep. Sharice Davids, a Democrat from Kansas and a member of the U.S. House Agriculture Committee, said the Trump administration’s blueprint for surging fees on American shipping companies would inflict damage on businesses and farmers, as well as threaten national security.
She said Trump administration’s proposed fee change could prove so costly that Seaboard’s marine division might be forced out of business.
“While I support strengthening America’s shipbuilding industry and the American workers employed by the sector, I am concerned that the proposed action, as currently written, will have unintended consequences that would be devastating for United States-owned international ocean carriers and employment at dozens of ports around the country,” Davids said.
Davids said industry experts warned the trade representative’s strategy could backfire by disrupting supply chains, driving up costs, narrowing options for U.S. exporters and providing Chinese companies with a competitive advantage.
She said the trade representative should amend proposed docking levies to protect U.S.-owned shipping companies while also encouraging growth of American shipbuilding.
The plan called for a service fee of up to $1 million for Chinese-owned operators of shipping vessels making a U.S. port of call. The fee could rise to $1.5 million for fleets containing Chinese-built vessels making a port of call.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/P8290413-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-07 17:09:05.086401

Elected April 1, Democrat Rep. Jason Lowe was expected to be sworn in as county commissioner Monday. 
A special primary election to fill the now-vacant legislative seat, which covers parts of northeast Oklahoma City and surrounding areas, is June 10. If needed, a special runoff would be Aug. 12 and a special general election on Sept. 9, said Misha Mohr with the State Election Board. 
Lowe thanked his colleagues, legislative staff and constituents as he addressed the House chamber for the last time. 
“It is with a mixture of gratitude, community pride, and definitely sadness that I stand before you today to announce my resignation,” Lowe said on the House floor. 
While in the Legislature, he chaired the Oklahoma Legislative Black Caucus and worked to host three annual Black History Day celebrations at the Capitol. 
“It’s been the honor of a lifetime to serve the great residents of House District 97,” he said in a statement. “I’m thankful to have been elected to serve you and to serve alongside my esteemed colleagues of the legislature. I want to thank my colleagues for all of their support and insight they’ve given me over the years.”
House Minority Leader Cyndi Munson, D-Oklahoma City, said she was grateful to work alongside Lowe in the House. 
“He has worked hard to be a voice for his constituents in Oklahoma City, and I trust he will continue to serve Oklahomans well in his new capacity as County Commissioner,” she said in a statement. “As a longtime advocate and vocal voice on criminal justice reform, I know he will take that same passion to Oklahoma County. He will be missed at the Capitol, but I know his service to Oklahomans will be long-lasting.”
There are two other open seats in the Oklahoma House in House Districts 71 and 74. The two Tulsa County-area seats became vacant when lawmakers stepped down to take jobs in city and county government.

Ron DeSantis’ latest jab at the Florida House came during a press conference Monday, when the governor criticized the lower chamber’s lack of action on a bill that would prohibit police from stopping boats to conduct safety inspections.
This legislative session has been marked by DeSantis’ public condemnation of the House’s moves to override his budget vetoes, cut the sales tax, and question executive agency heads. The governor’s comments during the press conference in Panama City Beach focused on legislation (SB 1388 and HB 1001) the chamber hasn’t taken up, as the time to do so is beginning to wind down.
“If it doesn’t pass the House, it’s only because of them taking an obstructionist bent, not because it doesn’t have support from the vast majority of folks throughout the state of Florida,” DeSantis said during the event in Treasure Island Marina.
While the legislation, known as the “Boater Freedom Act,” hasn’t moved in the House, it is scheduled for its second of three hearings in the Senate on Thursday.
Panama City Republican Sen. Jay Trumbull joined DeSantis but refrained from bashing the House, instead saying that Republican Rep. Philip Griffitts of Panama City Beach “is working hard to try to get the bill up in the House.”
Aside from making violations of safety and marine sanitation regulations a secondary offense, the bill preempts local governments from restricting use of water vessels based on their power source, such as gas or diesel.
House Speaker Daniel Perez on Thursday told reporters that his conversations with DeSantis remained cordial but said the governor’s videos slamming him and the House on X were “mind-boggling” and “disheartening.”
“For some reason, it seems the last week or so the governor has been a little more emotional and has been upset and has done on his videos to voice his opinions in another way. He has every right to do so,” Perez said.

Ambrose Castellano's complaint filed with the New Mexico Ethics Commission. (Photo courtesy of Ambrosio E. Castellano)The independent state agency that enforces New Mexico’s ethical conduct laws regarding professional lobbyists also has authority over organizations that mount ad campaigns intended to influence state lawmakers, a court ruled last week.
The New Mexico Court of Appeals unanimously ruled on April 3 that when lawmakers in 2019 passed the State Ethics Commission Act, they intended to give the New Mexico Ethics Commission power to handle complaints not only about individual lobbyists and their employers, but also to organizations that run lobbying advertising campaigns.
The ruling stems from a complaint filed with the commission against Albuquerque-based New Mexico Families Forward, which registered with the Secretary of State as a lobbying advertising campaign on Feb. 5, 2022, in the middle of that year’s regular legislative session.
In its complaint filed that May, the reelection campaign for former Rep. Ambrose Castellano (D-Serafina) alleged that NMFF violated the law by failing to disclose the identity of its donors, and how much they had given.
Attorney Ambrosio E. Castellano, the former lawmaker’s son, represented his father’s campaign in the Commission case against NMFF. He told Source NM on Monday that he was not previously aware of the ruling, and celebrated it as a victory.
“We’re happy with the Court of Appeals ruling,” he said. “I think it’s important that there’s transparency in our elections and all those who are lobbying either on behalf of a candidate or against a candidate, whether it’s an individual or an organization. I think it’s a great win not only for our client, but I think it’s a great win for New Mexico as a whole.”
Voicemails and emails seeking comment from the Ethics Commission’s spokesperson and two lawyers for New Mexico Families Forward were not returned as of Monday.
Castellano said he looks forward to the Commission prosecuting the case further and seeing if NMFF will be held accountable and be ordered to comply with the law moving forward.
He said as far as knows, NMFF still hasn’t disclosed their donors’ identities, nor the amounts they gave toward the campaign against his father.

According to the complaint, NMFF sent targeted mailers to people in the area Ambrose Castellano represented, House District 70, which includes the cities of Las Vegas and Moriarty, the Village of Pecos, Ribera and other parts of San Miguel and Torrance counties.
A copy included in the complaint shows the mailers encouraged recipients to call him and ask why he voted against House Bill 132, which was eventually signed into law and banned exorbitantly high interest rates on small loans, capping them at 36%.
“Representative Ambrose Castellano voted against hard-working New Mexicans,” one of the mailers states.
NMFF started distributing the advertisements on Feb. 3, 2022, as the legislation was still being debated, according to a report it later filed with the Secretary of State. The group spent $36,000 on the mailers, the report states.
After Castellano filed the complaint with the Commission in April 2022, the Commission referred it to the Secretary of State, who reported that she could not certify that NMFF complied with the law because it had “failed to disclose the names of the contributors to its lobbying advertising campaign, and the amounts each contributed.”
NMFF argued that the Commission’s jurisdiction to enforce the Lobbyist Reporting Act extended only to complaints against “individuals” who are “lobbyists and lobbyists employers.” Since NMFF is not a lobbyist and does not employ one, it argued, the Commission did not have jurisdiction to enforce the law against it.
NMFF took the Commission to court in October 2022, and Second Judicial District Court Judge Daniel Ramczyk that December found that the Commission had “unlawfully attempted to exercise jurisdiction over” the group. He ordered the Commission to halt all proceedings in the case against NMFF, and to dismiss it.
But the Commission appealed Ramczyk’s ruling to the New Mexico Court of Appeals, which has now reversed his decision, sent the case back to him and ordered him to send it back to the Commission.
The judges noted that the appeal marks the first time ever that the Court of Appeals has been asked to determine the commission’s jurisdiction under the State Ethics Commission Act. Lawmakers passed the new law and the governor signed it in 2019 to implement voters’ decision the year before to create the Ethics Commission.

On a Staten Island pier in New York harbor, she was expecting her first biological child — her daughter Kelcie — but gave birth to another — the Navy destroyer USS The Sullivans, hull number DDG-68, named for her grandfather and great uncles who died together in World War II.
She gave the order, “Man this ship and bring her to life!” and the sailors, men and women, ran on board and manned their stations.
On Saturday, she watched another woman, who has become her friend, do the same thing, as former Iowa first lady Christie Vilsack give those orders to the crew of the new USS Iowa submarine, hull number SSN-797, in Groton, Conn., where the sub was built.
Sullivan, also a member of the USS Iowa commissioning committee, had planned to be in Connecticut to support her friend. Due to travel and other complications, she did the next best thing. She attended a watch party for the commissioning ceremonies at Waterloo’s Sullivan Brothers Iowa Veterans Museum, part of the Grout Museum District. The Waterloo event, one of more than two dozen parties around the state, was attended by dozens of Cedar Valley residents who filled the museum “mess hall” events area, including many Navy and other military veterans.
One of those veterans was Kelly Sullivan’s father — Jim Sullivan, the son of Albert Sullivan, the youngest of the five brothers. He was a toddler when his dad and uncles George, Francis, Joseph and Madison were killed when the USS Juneau was sunk during the naval Battle of Guadalcanal. He followed his father and uncles into the Navy and served on a destroyer. Kelly and her father were surrounded by well-wishers who also turned out to welcome Iowa’s new namesake ship into service.

“It’s a historic day for the Navy, a historic day for Iowa,” Kelly Sullivan said. “I think the biggest thing is celebrating our state, our great state, and all the people who have served our country from Iowa. Iowa has a rich history of service and patriotism. Today’s a day where we celebrate that. It’s a big deal.”
It was the end of a long process, six years, to build and commission the Iowa, a Virginia-class nuclear submarine with the most up-to-date firepower and “silent running” technology. It was a challenge for contractors, crew and the commissioning committee. Work continued through the COVID-19 pandemic.
“The thing that really amazed me is all the people who make this happen,” Sullivan said. “People don’t realize what happens behind the scenes.” Many of the commissioning committee members were Iowans and Navy veterans; Iowa firms helped with the construction. “It’s neat to have so many Iowans involved in this process. And it’s been wonderful to watch the whole thing unfold for all these years.
“I feel honored to have been part of it,” Sullivan said, and she emphasized the USS Iowa sailors feel a part of the state of Iowa as well — as evidenced by crew members volunteering to help clean up the grounds of the Iowa Veterans Home in Marshalltown, and parts of Cedar Rapids, after the August 2020 derecho.
“They sent a truck full of USS Iowa volunteers,” Sullivan said. “They had generators, they had electric chainsaws, water, food and fuel. And they came for four days. They met in Marshalltown — Christie Vilsack met me there.”
They removed downed trees and limbs and helped restore some of the adjacent storm-damaged cemetery. “And then they went to Cedar Rapids and did work,” she said.
“Those sailors, they’re our family,” Sullivan said. “It’s just like The Sullivans. We have sailors from The Sullivans that come to visit Iowa all the time. Because that’s their state. It’s even more so with these sailors. These sailors feel a family connection to the state of Iowa. They’ll bring their grandkids here, and kids here, and say, ‘This is the state that represents the boat that I am plank owner (original crew member) of.’ ”
Sullivan said she also connected USS Iowa sailors with a Navy cycling crew which participates in RAGBRAI, Iowa’s annual cross-state bicycle ride, and they are part of that team now as well.
“They also go to the State Fair — they’re very well represented at the State Fair — they’ve been here (in Waterloo) a couple of times for Iowa Irish Fest, RAGBRAI and the derecho (relief effort). That’s just a few of them. So many more things than that. That’s the thing we also now celebrate, is that these sailors are now part of our Iowa family.”

The new USS Iowa is the latest and best sub in the fleet in terms of armaments and capabilities, and the first submarine with total accommodations for a crew of men and women. But it is also loaded with tradition — and one of those traditions is the role of the ship sponsor, a role that Sullivan and Vilsack are very mindful of.
The sponsor, traditionally a woman, is chosen by the Secretary of the Navy. She is technically considered a member of the crew. Sullivan has always referred to the USS The Sullivans as “my ship” and Christie Vilsack feels the same way.
Vilsack, a journalism graduate of the University of Iowa and a former columnist for the Mount Pleasant News where her husband, former Gov. Tom Vilsack, served as mayor before seeking state and national office, expressed her feelings in her new online column, “Common Ground,” she now writes as a member of the Iowa Writers Collaborative.
“Most people associate a boat christening with a woman and broken bottle of champagne. That would be me on Jun 17, 2022. But the story of a boat sponsor christening a Navy vessel is about a special long-time relationship between a woman chosen by the Navy to care for the crew and families of for the rest of her life,” Christie Vilsack wrote. “The officers, crew and families of the USS Iowa SSN-797 refer to me as the ‘mom of the boat.’ ”
  The official crest of the new U.S.S. Iowa submarine (SSN-797) includes a likeness of its predecessor namesake battleship, the U.S.S. Iowa BB-61, as well as a shamrock in honor of Waterloo’s five Sullivan brothers killed during World War II. (Illustration courtesy of the U.S. Navy)
In those christening ceremonies, she said, “Thanks to fellow Iowa teacher, Kelly Sullivan, sponsor of USS The Sullivans DDG-68, a ship to honor the five Sullivan brothers, including her grandfather, who were all killed at sea in World War II aboard the USS Juneau. She has been a great mentor and friend.”
Kelly Sullivan is one of the most active and visible ship sponsors in the Navy, supporting the USS The Sullivans crew in Iowa, its home port in Florida, New York and even attended a port visit in Ireland. Similarly, she has engaged and helped Vilsack, also the daughter of a Navy veteran and aviator, into her role as USS Iowa sponsor as they’ve worked together on projects and events like Iowa Irish Fest and the derecho cleanup.
“I feel blessed to be involved, and to have those connections with Christie,” Sullivan said. “She’s fabulous, and she’s going to make a great sponsor. She said, ‘I love being a sponsor and I’m very blessed to have this role.’ I’m proud of her. She has a very strong Navy family history and she’s really excited about this.”
And, Sullivan noted, Vilsack has her granddaughters involved with the ship as maids of honor, who serve as proxies in the sponsor’s absence and carry on her role — potentially, Sullivan said, for the ship’s entire service life.
Also at Saturday’s watch party was U.S. Army Korean War era veteran Bill Keane of Waterloo, who also attended the 1997 commissioning of the USS The Sullivans at Staten Island, New York with a large contingent of Cedar Valley area residents. He also is a member of the Sullivan Brothers chapter of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in Waterloo. He saw a parallel between the two commissioning ceremonies.
It’s ‘Anchors Aweigh’ for new USS Iowa

“It just feels wonderful because of the Iowa connection,” he said. “We’re just so proud of the Sullivan brothers, were proud of Kelly and the family and her devotion to history.”
Reminders of the Sullivan brothers’ sacrifice sail with the USS Iowa too. The official ship’s crest bears a shamrock in commemoration of the brothers’ Irish heritage and their service. It also bears a likeness of its predecessor ship, the battleship USS Iowa, BB-61, which served from World War II through 1990 and is now a museum in the Port of Los Angeles. One of the battleship’s nicknames was “The Grey Ghost,” and the submarine crew has drawn from that with its motto, “Fear the Ghost.” The ship’s crest also bears 47 stars for each of the sailors who were killed when the battleship’s No. 2 gun turret exploded in April 1989. Members of the Battleship Iowa Museum were in Groton for the commissioning as well.
Sullivan and Vilsack also are carrying on traditions from their ships’ predecessor vessels in their roles as sponsors.
Kelly’s great grandmother Alleta sponsored the first Navy destroyer USS The Sullivans DD-537, which served from World War II through 1977 and is now at a military park in Buffalo, N.Y.
Similarly, preceding Christie Vilsack as sponsor of the battleship USS Iowa was Ilo Wallace of Indianola, wife of U.S. Vice President Henry Wallace of Orient. He also served as secretary of agriculture, as Gov. Vilsack did during the Obama and Biden administrations.
Vilsack also knows, from Sullivan’s example, that a sponsor also supports a ship when its crew is at sea and potentially in harm’s way. In November, the USS The Sullivans embarked on its fifth overseas deployment in the past three years.

John Creery of Waterloo, who served in the Air Force from 1969-89 including a tour in Vietnam, said he had served at a fighter installation near the Bath Iron Works in Maine where the current USS The Sullivans was built and christened, but had never attended a ship launch, christening or commissioning. “So this sounded kind of cool,” he said.
The watch party also offered plenty of good-natured inter-service razzing and camaraderie among the many veterans in attendance — like the group of sailors who griped about a Marine veteran giving them orders while they nonetheless accommodated him to pose for a group photo.
Jim Sullivan struck up a conversation with fellow “tin can sailor” Paul Reuter of Waterloo, who served on the destroyer USS Robinson during the Korean War.
Reuter told Sullivan his grandkids had asked him if he’d ever killed anyone while in service. “I dunno … I was the cook …” he deadpanned.

(Photo by Shondiin Silversmith/Arizona Mirror)A provision in the secret, controversial agreement allowing a private company to transport uranium ore across the Arizona side of the Navajo Nation has New Mexico anti-nuclear advocates increasingly worried about the prospect of new mining activity near a mountain sacred to the Navajo people.
The Navajo Nation in late January agreed to let Energy Fuels transport uranium ore from its Pinyon Plains Mine in Arizona to its mill in White Mesa, Utah. Neither party has released the agreement, calling it confidential, they have described what it says in broad terms, and a transport policy, overseen by the United States Forest Service, details plans in case of an emergency.
Two to three truckloads a day are making the trek across the western edge of the Navajo Nation into Utah, officials have said at recent public meetings. That number could increase to 10, said Stephen Etsitty, director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, at recent chapter house meetings, according to video attendees shared on social media.
In exchange, Energy Fuels agreed to pay the Navajo Nation $1.2 million and also clean up as much as 10,000 tons of material from old uranium mines for free. Energy Fuels would also pay the nation 50 cents per pound of uranium processed at the mill.
Energy Fuels also owns the Roca Honda mine near Mount Taylor in New Mexico. The shortest route from Roca Honda to the White Mesa Mill in Utah also runs through the Navajo Nation.

Energy Fuels spokesperson Curtis Moore declined to say exactly what the transport agreement said regarding the Roca Honda mine, citing the agreement’s confidentiality. But he did acknowledge the agreement contemplated the New Mexico mine’s eventual operation.
“If Roca Honda were to proceed, we agreed to take quite a bit more cleanup material at no charge to the Navajo Nation,” Moore said in an email Friday to Source New Mexico.
‘How are we going to beat this monster?’
Cheyenne Antonio, an advocate with Diné C.A.R.E, told Source that she asked Navajo Nation officials at a recent meeting about the prospect of uranium transport in New Mexico. She said Stephen Etsitty, executive director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, told her that no roads had been approved yet in New Mexico for uranium transport.
Etsitty told Source New Mexico on Monday that it’s far too early to say what the route could be, but that the Cibola National Forest has presented some options in old draft environmental impact statements in the mine.
Estimates Etsitty has reviewed show that far more trucks would cross the Navajo Nation each day from the Roca Honda mine, based on assessments of the amount of uranium could produce. Between 50 and 60 trucks a day is the maximum, Etsitty said.
The Navajo Nation has, for years, opposed the development of any mine near Mount Taylor, known as Tsoodził in Navajo, Etsitty said.
But if the Roca Honda mine is approved, Etsitty said the new transport agreement contains “a framework” that would require Energy Fuels to remove 30,000 more tons of abandoned uranium mine material, on top of the 10,000 tons the company has already promised to remove as part of the Pinyon Plains transport agreement.
Energy Fuels pushed for the provision, Etsitty said, because the company believes it is far enough along in getting that mine approved that it was necessary.
“We looked at it and and we agreed, but we also stipulated that we were not waiving, we were not pre-judging, nothing was pre-decisional,” he said in a phone interview Monday with Source New Mexico. “Meaning that we were not agreeing with them that we support the Roca Honda project. Because we reserved our right to comment fully and vigorously on that project.”
The company has listed the Roca Honda project as in the “advanced” stage of permitting on its website, but the website has said that since at least 2019, according to the Internet archive.
Antonio and Leona Morgan, who heads up Haul No!, a group opposing the transport agreement, organized a small gathering at an Albuquerque library on Thursday to discuss the latest on uranium mining in Arizona and New Mexico and brainstorm ideas to oppose its extraction and transport.

“My question,” Morgan asked those in attendance, “is what is our solution to fighting it? How are we going to deal with it? How are we going to beat this monster?”
Uranium mining between the 1940s and the 1970s in and around the Navajo Nation left cancer and pollution in its wake. Companies operating in the area back then abandoned hundreds of uranium mines that continue to poison groundwater and otherwise hurt public health.
So the prospect of new mining and its transport has incensed members of the Navajo Nation, Antonio said. At a meeting late last month at the Mexican Water Chapter in Utah, one elder woman spoke up to say, in Navajo, that the agreement amounted to the tribe killing the Navajo way of life without members’ input.
“You agreed to kill our whole Navajo universe without our consent,” the elder said, according to Antonio’s translation.
Moore, the Energy Fuels spokesperson, noted that the company had nothing to do with the legacy uranium mines, which were drilled to produce weapons material, and that it is doing its part as “good samaritans” to clean up the old companies’ messes.
“Our uranium is only used for clean, carbon-free … nuclear energy, not weapons,” Moore said.
‘The Trump administration is moving quickly’
While outside observers and both parties to the agreement agree many hurdles remain in the way of the state’s first new uranium mine in more than 50 years, they see the transport agreement as the latest domino to fall.
Already this year, Cibola National Forest officials deemed the Roca Honda mine a “priority project,” following an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to boost domestic energy production. Trump’s pushes to make public lands profitable and his newly announced tariffs could also point in the direction of new uranium mines here, Moore said.
“Roca Honda is a large and high-grade uranium deposit that could enhance U.S. energy independence considerably,” Moore said. “We are not sure what the executive orders mean yet in terms of concrete actions. However, the Trump administration is moving quickly to reduce America’s dependence on Russian and Chinese uranium and rare earth imports, which are the two commodities Energy Fuels produces today.”
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

As for tariffs, Moore said the taxes on imports could “support domestic uranium and rare earth production.”
Also, the price of uranium has risen steadily since 2020, including cresting at a little more than $100 a pound last January. That’s close to the point at which new mines are profitable, according to Eric Jantz, legal director at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center.
Etsitty, speaking to a small crowd gathered at a chapter house in Crownpoint last month, said the price hitting $100 last January is what prompted the new speculation in and around the Navajo Nation.
“That’s what drives all of this. When people say, what is this all about? Is it just about money? Yes, it’s just about money to the industry,” Etsitty said.
Moore said regulatory review can take years, even decades, for a new mine, especially if anti-mining interests get in the way.
“Anti-nuclear and anti-mining interests can severely delay good domestic mining projects,” he wrote. “Therefore, we would welcome any shortening of permitting timelines, and reductions in ‘lawfare’ and nuisance lawsuits, to get domestic critical mineral projects into production to support energy, economic and national security quickly.”
Navajo Nation officials have defended the agreement as the best deal they could strike in the face of a lawsuit they feel they would likely lose. In the Crownpoint meeting and a question-and-answer virtual meeting shortly after they struck the agreement, Nation officials cited the Supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, which they said pre-empts the tribe’s right to restrict uranium transport over roads that course through the Navajo Nation.
“We are supportive of the overarching desire to not have these functioning and operating, but we can’t stop it,” Etsitty said in the meeting. “So now we’re trying to manage it.”

Scott Perry talking to reporters at the Capitol Sept. 19, 2023 (Jennifer Shutt/ States Newsroom)As the stock market falls sharply, two Pennsylvania Congressmen from battleground districts focused on economic priorities during a conservative conference in Cumberland County.
“We ran on making life affordable again. We ran on having safe communities, and a border that’s secure and I don’t think that’s a very advanced formulary in order to achieve the goals in which we all clearly spoke on November 5,” said U.S. Rep. Rob Bresnahan (R-8th District) on Friday. “But that’s what we ultimately try to do every single day.”
“From my standpoint, my mission is to save the republic,” said U.S. Rep. Scott Perry (R-10th District). “That’s my mission.”
Both are Republicans and support President Donald Trump, but have aligned themselves with different caucuses. Bresnahan is a member of the bipartisan “Problem Solvers Caucus,” led by U.S. Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-1st District) and Tom Suozzi (D-NY). Perry is a former Chair of the conservative House Freedom Caucus and is viewed as one of Trump’s allies in the state who supported his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss.

They spoke to the crowd for over 15 minutes, but didn’t spend much time addressing the big news dominating headlines: Trump’s tariff announcement on taxing imported products from around the world.
While Trump says the move was made to promote American manufacturing, economists worry about the increases in prices for businesses and citizens, alike. Plus, the stock market had it’s worst week for the United States since the coronavirus pandemic.
Following their speeches, Bresnahan and Perry spoke with reporters and said they still support Trump’s plan.
“I have not met with an industry in DC and or locally that does not have concerns about the tariffs that are being implemented, but it’s about producing American manufacturing. It’s about bringing those jobs and national security back to the United States,” Bresnahan told the Capital-Star. “Would I perhaps have seen it like to have seen it more incrementally over a period of time? But the moral of the story, and the idea, is to bring the different countries together, start these negotiations.”
“And I’m a big believer in ripping the band aid off, but I’m also a big believer in targeted applications for most things,” he added.
“There’s always going to be concerns,” Perry said. “Certainly for short-term market volatility, but it’s going to shake out once everybody understands what the playing field is.”
“It’s the uncertainty that creates the volatility,” he added. “Once the certainty is there, the volatility will go away, because everybody knows these are the rules.”
Perry said there “has to be some rebalancing of the ledger financially between other countries and our country,” when detailing his support of Trump’s announcement. He added that the United States “cannot be dependent on the Communist Party of China” for products like steel and India for “drug and pharmaceutical precursors or the pharmaceuticals themselves.”
“The only way those industries come back is to incentivize them,” Perry said. “Like I said, we can’t force regulation and taxes in those other countries, but we can change what we do here.”
For Bresnahan, it was his first appearance at the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference as an elected official. He defeated several term incumbent U.S. Rep. Matt Cartwright (D-Lackawanna) by 1.6% for a seat representing northeast Pennsylvania last November, which was one of the most expensive races in the nation.

During his speech, he detailed his road to running for Congress and his background in the private sector, while highlighting the work ahead for a few of the committees he serves on, including Transportation and Infrastructure and Agriculture.
Bresnahan promoted extending the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, also known as the Trump tax cuts.
“It’s imperative that we make TCJA permanent,” he told the Capital-Star on Friday.
Perry, who is a regular at the conservative conference in his district, secured reelection in November by defeating Democratic challenger Janelle Stelson by 1.2%. It was his closest reelection bid since winning a seat in Congress in 2012.
Perry made it clear that the national debt was top of mind for him and explained his concern with the U.S. Senate’s spending proposal they advanced just hours before his speech.

Birch Building in Nashville, in which a Community Corrections program has operated. (Photo: Brad Freeman, Metropolitan Nashville General Sessions Court)Three years after curtailing an intensive probation program, the Department of Correction is reviving Community Corrections as part of a last-ditch effort to keep offenders out of prison.
The state is taking bids from probation programs across Tennessee to resume supervision services to thousands of people on the brink of being sentenced to prison time. Requests for proposals are to be filed by April 14.
Department of Correction spokesperson Dorinda Carter declined to say whether the state is taking a new direction, only that probation services contracts were set to expire and bids were re-issued to provide “alternatives to incarceration.”
Gov. Bill Lee’s administration — despite orders from lawmakers to keep Community Corrections going because of its effectiveness — practically wrote the program out of existence with a request for proposals that required different guidelines. Vendors would have to offer either day reporting centers, outpatient treatment or a residential facility, and some weren’t prepared to make such a shift.
Davidson County Community Corrections keeps clients alive

Legislators also sent a strong message to correction officials at an August 2023 meeting that they wanted the program to be renewed, instead of shifting all offenders to the state’s probation program, which is considered understaffed and less effective. Lawmakers enacted the program in 1985 as a last-ditch effort to keep people who didn’t qualify for regular probation out of prison.
Republican Sen. Ed Jackson of Jackson has been working for three years to renew the program to allow Madison County’s Community Corrections to start serving probationers again.
“Ever since they did away with it in several counties across the state, every one of them has said we really need it back. It’s been effective, it’s been good for us, keeps some people out of jail, lets them stay out and work, be supervised locally instead of going to a correctional facility,” Jackson said. 
The program cost $13.8 million when in full swing in 2022.

The decision reversed a Biden administration decision that rescinded a $5 million Title X grant in 2023 because the state’s health department said it would no longer refer patients for abortions under Oklahoma’s restrictive abortion laws. Providing education and counseling about abortions at the patient’s request had been required to receive the federal grants.
Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond sued in federal court in 2023, claiming the loss of the grant was punishment for Oklahoma’s efforts to “protect unborn life.”
The Trump administration last week dropped the challenge and restored nearly $2 million of the grant, said Erica Rankin, a spokesperson for the Health Department. She said the agency doesn’t know yet what the total award will be. 
Rankin said the agency is appreciative of the efforts to restore Oklahoma’s Title X grant and looks forward to providing important services throughout the state. 
“The funding, together with state and local dollars, pays for our medical and support staff as well as supplies, training and equipment,” she said in a statement. “Our staff provides the services at our county health department locations in 68 counties and we contract with (Oklahoma City-County Health Department) and Tulsa to provide these services.”
The Trump administration recently pulled over $27 million in Title X funding to family planning clinics, including Oklahoma’s Planned Parenthood. 
Tennessee also saw its Title X funding partially restored.

Kansas Reflector obtained leaked copies of the more than 1,500 submissions sent to officials between Feb. 3 and March 28 containing specific public input from across the state alongside sarcastic replies, spam and suggestions in jest. A significant portion of those submissions showed a sense of disillusionment with Kansas politics, politicians and government. A few submissions contained personal stories of inefficiencies in state government. Even fewer included complaints or opinions in line with Republican policy.
Sen. Renee Erickson, a Wichita Republican and chair of the efficiency committee, has promised that the committee will meet outside of the legislative session to review the submissions. Republican leadership created the Senate Committee on Government Efficiency, or COGE, earlier this year in response to the similar federal effort from billionaire Elon Musk called the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. The committee sponsored 11 bills this session, many of which targeted public assistance programs, public employees or spending cuts. Little, if any, of the committee’s work this year aligned with what Kansans suggested.
Suggestions could be submitted in one of two ways: via email or a standardized form in a public portal that includes the submitter’s first and last name, an age range and their county, city and zip code. The form notes that submissions are public records. Kansas Reflector did not independently verify the names provided with submissions.
Kansas Reflector submitted a request for the public records to Erickson in February. Erickson said she would deliver them to journalists on April 9, even though she delivered them to a legislator on March 17 in response to his formal records request. Under the Kansas Open Records Act, public records are required to be provided as soon as possible. 
One suggestion from Ben Carmichael, a Wichita resident in his 30s, detailed concerns that the Legislature has morphed into a “full-time machine, expanding its power and influence without corresponding checks in accountability, transparency, or fiscal restraint.” He pointed to continued meetings among legislators outside of the session and the consolidation of power within the Legislative Coordinating Council, which is made up of the governor and legislative leadership. 
The line is blurred, he said, between “part-time service and full-time rule.”
“Instead of trusting Kansans to govern their own lives and communities, the state has taken on a paternalistic posture, eroding both personal freedom and local governance,” Carmichael wrote. “This is not only inefficient government — it is unjust government.”
Carmichael added that in times of national division and economic uncertainty, Kansans don’t need more laws, rules or interference.
“They need a Legislature that knows its limits and remembers its mandate: to serve, not to rule,” Carmichael wrote. “Shrink the footprint of government. Restore the citizen Legislature. Let Kansans live free.”

Attacks on health and autonomy
Around 300 submissions included mention of abortion. Most begged legislators to leave the issue alone, as voters made their opinions clear in the August 2022 primary, during which a constitutional amendment to eliminate abortion rights failed by a 59-41 margin.
Bethany Quesnell, a 30-something in Wamego, said elected officials could be most effective if they listened to the stories of the constituents in their districts.
“Don’t just stop listening after one person who matches your personal beliefs, either,” Quesnell wrote.
And if an issue has been voted on in recent years, Quesnell suggested officials refrain from bringing that issue up again.
“Abortion is a great example,” Quesnell said. “Kansans made their opinions known and we don’t want to hear about it anymore.”
Submitters characterized the Legislature’s continued focus on abortion regulation as a waste of time and money.
“The amount of times transgender healthcare and abortion have come up in this legislature is downright wasteful,” said Kat Stucky, a Cheney resident in her 30s.
More than 130 suggestions told lawmakers to stop legislating trans issues.
Stucky, and several other commenters, said trans people make up a tiny fraction of Kansas’ population but have received a significant amount of focus, particularly this legislative session.
Pamela Sturm, a septuagenarian from Kansas City, Kansas, said the state could save money if the Legislature focused on issues guided by voter’s actions.
“The legislature has decided that attacking transgender kids is a more legitimate target for their attention than dealing with real issues for Kansans, just as they’ve decided to deny Kansas residents legitimate access to cannabis and that it’s okay for rural hospitals to close because they refuse to honor the will of the people by expanding Medicaid in our state,” Sturm wrote.

Expanding Medicaid
A “very frustrated and defeated” single mother of three, Ashlie Bruner, wrote to legislators in February detailing a recent denial of health care coverage under the state’s Medicaid program. Bruner is caught in what is known as the Medicaid gap.
Her employer doesn’t offer health insurance. She said she earns $1,200 a month while the state Medicaid income cap for a household of four is $880 a month.
“This has left me in a position where I can not afford health insurance or do not qualify for lower rates or state insurance as my income is either too high or too low,” she said. “The system is flawed.”
Average rental prices, bills and necessities make up a majority of Bruner’s spending, and, as a single parent, she said she struggles to pay those costs.
“I know I’m not the only person with this problem,” she said. “And it leaves the question of what am I supposed to do?”
Bruner begged legislators for a solution because she cannot seek medical care without paying out of pocket, leaving her “suffering through illnesses or medical conditions unable to afford the help I need.”
The vast majority of the roughly 180 submissions that mentioned Medicaid supported expansion or opposed further cuts to the program. Kansas is one of 10 states that hasn’t expanded Medicaid. Roger Smith, a Wichita resident in his 70s, suggested the Legislature ensure Medicaid fraud isn’t taking place by reviewing and confirming that Medicaid participants are appropriately using allocated funds.
“Let us all be responsible for supplying the resources needed to those that truly need it,” Smith said. “Being a good steward at all levels is very important for everyone’s survival.”

Funding or dismantling education
Suggestions on education were varied. Legislators in recent years have attempted to impose influence on education typically reserved for the Kansas State Board of Education. The Legislature controls funding for public schools and has the ability to create voucher programs.
Sandra Kirby, a 40-something from Pittsburg, asked legislators to oppose any legislation that would eliminate the Kansas State Department of Education. Kirby said taxpayers shouldn’t support any religious institution or school.
“If a person wanted to send their kids to a private or religious school- so be it,” Kirby wrote, “but leave the rest of Kansans alone.”
Kirby added: “NO VOUCHERS.”
Ryan Patton, a Hutchinson resident in his 40s, said the Kansas education system costs taxpayers around $18,000 annually per student, which is true according to KSDE data. Homeschooling produces better results, he said.
“The Kansas education system is far beyond repair and needs to be dismantled,” Patton wrote. “There is extreme amounts of waste of these funds that never reach the teachers let alone the children.”
Rick Ruppe, who did not include an age or location in his email to the committee, applauded the Legislature’s proposal to shift the Kansas Supreme Court judicial selection process to a popular vote instead of the current nomination and appointment system.
It’s long overdue, he said.
State education funding, Ruppe said, is one area that has been part of a series of “bad outcomes in decisions being made by the court, which have been politically and ideologically slanted towards liberal and progressive viewpoints.”
The Kansas Supreme Court has repeatedly determined the Legislature is not adequately funding education. Ruppe characterized the wording of the Kansas State Constitution that has been used to determine funding requirements as vague.
“This has led to this issue becoming a political football, with the punting of a real solution, much like kicking a can down the road, with no clear criteria for what ‘sufficient or adequate’ funding is,” he said.
He added that the court also erred in ruling the state constitution includes implicit rights that allow legal abortions.

‘Frivolous lawsuits’
Nearly 60 submissions included criticism of the Kansas Attorney General’s performance. Many claimed Kris Kobach’s “frivolous lawsuits” have cost Kansas taxpayers millions, and others called for him to be fired.
Amy Warfield, a Hays resident in her 30s, said “a more efficient Kansas state government would better seek to reign in vanity lawsuits” from Kobach, which include banning abortion drug mifepristone, blocking immigrants without citizenship from being counted in the Census, and limiting Title IX protections for youths.
“In fact, the list of confrontations and lawsuits is so long and such a tangled web, it’s difficult to parse through what is even in the best interest of the people of this state and its funds, or just ideological check boxes,” Warfield said.
Brice Cronn, a Colby resident in his 40s, suggested the Legislature refrain from passing any legislation having to do with Kobach.
“Millions in litigation costs are unacceptable,” Cronn wrote.
“This culture war stuff makes you popular with a certain voting block, but it is a nonsensical money pit that doesn’t do anything to improve the wellbeing of Kansans,” he said.
Kari Nilson, an Andover resident in her 40s, said the best way to cut government spending would be to “get Kris Kobach to quit filing lawsuits that the people of Kansas don’t want to be part of.”

Government efficiency
Roberta Hill, who identified herself as a disabled Navy veteran, began her email by giving credit to the state of Kansas for taking care of its veterans.
“I as a 100% disabled female veteran would move to Kansas, yet I financially could not afford to own a home,” Hill said.
In her current state, which she did not disclose, she doesn’t have to pay property taxes on the home she owns.
“I don’t abuse my taxes exempt status,” she said. “I believe in paying taxes on a lot of things. If Kansas allowed veterans to own homes and not pay property taxes. You would have them in your state paying taxes on other things. Helping the economy of Kansas!”
Bills aimed at providing tax relief for veterans did not progress this session.
A handful of submissions requested greater transparency from Kansas government.
Jadie Chauncey, a Junction City resident, submitted a list of three issues, each with a clear proposal aimed at making Kansas government more open, fair and accessible. The three suggestions included eliminating “gut and go” bills, which allow legislators to entirely overhaul the content of a bill with unrelated legislation.
“This process confuses voters and allows bills to pass without proper review,” Chauncey said.
The second item suggested the Legislature make it easier for Kansans to submit testimony and establish a mandatory 72-hour notice before testimony submission deadlines. Chauncey called the current system “confusing and outdated.”
“Some committees give very short notice for hearings, change their rules often, and require paper copies of testimony,” Chauncey said. “This makes it hard for people who live far from Topeka or have jobs during the day to participate.”
Lastly, Chauncey noticed special interest groups tend to get more time than citizens and suggested ensuring all speakers at hearings get equal time to testify.
Mark Ummel, a Burlingame resident in his 60s, said he performed internal audits and investigations for 15 years at one of the state’s largest agencies. He retired not because he was ready but because he “became fed up with various senior leaders at the agency who would use their position of power to hire their personal friends for high paying jobs without advertising publicly, review audits only to hide the malfeasance or illegal activity and position their personal needs above what is best for the agency.”
State government operations could become more efficient, Ummel said, with improved audit practices that evaluate internal processes, wasteful spending and potential fraud.
“If the legislative process can be described as ‘making sausage,’ ” he said, “the inner workings inside the agencies could be describe(d) as the ‘slaughterhouse.’ ”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250407_134646-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-07 16:06:35.446247

The South Dakota Democratic Party announced on Monday that it will conduct public town halls in four South Dakota cities “in the absence of South Dakota’s Republican senators and congressman.” 
Afterward, state Republican Party Chairman Jim Eschenbaum told South Dakota Searchlight by phone that he’s also heard complaints about the congressional delegation’s accessibility. 
“Even some Republicans have been saying that,” Eschenbaum said.

Democrats held a press conference to announce their town halls, which will be led by Nikki Gronli, former state rural development director for the U.S. Department of Agriculture during the Biden administration. Julian Beaudion, a Sioux Falls businessman and former state trooper turned community activist, will also participate in the town halls. 
The press conference came two days after thousands of people took to the streets in Sioux Falls, and lesser crowds also gathered in Pierre and Rapid City, to join in national protests against the Trump administration.
Democrats at the Monday press conference alleged that the congressional delegation has been “silent” and ignored calls and emails from constituents who are upset about the Trump administration’s mass firings of federal employees, dismantling of federal departments and programs, and freezes or cancellations of federal grants and spending.
“A chainsaw has been taken to the pocketbooks and retirement plans of hardworking South Dakotans, all while safety net programs are being dismantled,” Gronli said.
Beaudion added, “We are about putting the people first.”

The announcement follows public criticisms of U.S. Senators John Thune and Mike Rounds, along with Rep. Dusty Johnson, who are all Republicans, for not holding in-person town halls. None of the three offices responded immediately Monday to South Dakota Searchlight’s request for a response to those criticisms.
Last month, media outlets including Politico reported that U.S. House Republican leaders advised their members to avoid in-person town hall meetings due to increasing confrontations with constituents over policies carried out by President Donald Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency, led by billionaire Elon Musk. 
The reports said House Speaker Mike Johnson and National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Richard Hudson recommended shifting to virtual formats like tele-town halls to mitigate disruptions from protesters.

New Mexico is one of a handful of states that will see an increased number of FBI agents to address unresolved violent crimes in Indian Country, including crimes related to a national crisis of Indigenous people disproportionately going missing and being killed.The Operation Not Forgotten initiative will send 60 FBI personnel to 10 field offices across the country, including Albuquerque, over six months, the Justice Department announced earlier this week.The operation has “provided investigative support” to over 500 cases in the past two years, resulting in “the recovery of 10 child victims, 52 arrests, and 25 indictments or judicial complaints,” according to an agency press release.

This next phase will include the largest number of agents yet, who will work in communities for the longest amount of time to date, Assistant U.S. Attorney Eliot Neal said during a meeting Friday of the state’s Missing and Murdered Indigenous Peoples Task Force in Farmington.
Neal, who is a member of the task force, told members it’s his understanding that agents sent to New Mexico will be working primarily in Farmington and Gallup.
“We have been able to make some great progress,” Neal said about working with agents sent to the state in the past year or two as part of the operation. “Unfortunately, because it’s been a short period of time, I feel like we make progress, and then [the agents are] gone, right? So this is a great opportunity to have them around for a little bit longer.”
During the last phase of the operation, in 2024, 50 FBI personnel worked in 10 field offices for four months, according to the agency, instead of six as called for this year.
The FBI’s Indian Country program had about 4,300 open investigations nationally at the start of fiscal year 2025, including over 900 death investigations, 1,000 child abuse investigations, and more than 500 domestic violence and adult sexual abuse investigations, according to the Justice Department.
The federal government has jurisdiction in prosecuting several types of violent crimes in Indian Country, including murder, kidnapping and sexual abuse.
‘Don’t give up’ 
Relatives of Indigenous people who have gone missing or been killed in the state spoke to the task force about their frustrations with a lack of law enforcement.
Becky Martinez, whose brother Calvin Martinez disappeared in 2019, told Neal that many Indigenous people go missing or are killed off reservations. That’s part of why the Justice Department created a regional outreach program focused on the crisis, which is the program he was hired under, Neal responded.
“I have worked on cases that have happened off the reservations where we use FBI resources,” Neal said. “The FBI has the cellular analysis survey team, for example. We’ve been able to help state and local law enforcement with cell site warrants, things like that, investigative techniques for cases where the FBI doesn’t have jurisdiction. But in those instances, it’s going to be an assist kind of situation.”
Since Julius Largo went missing near Morgan Lake in northwestern New Mexico in November, his family has organized searches for him, on their own and with help from a local nonprofit, his sister told the task force.
“We don’t see any FBI or criminal investigators until there’s a deceased body, and that’s what sucks,” Danielle Werito said. “With all these tips that we got, and I submitted to our detective, nothing is being done about it.”
Largo is a father and also has nieces and nephews who miss him, Werito said.
Mathilda Silago has been missing from Nageezi, also in northwestern New Mexico, since 2019. Her disappearance, Darrell Tsosie told task force members, has been “very challenging” for his and Mathilda’s daughter.
“I just want to tell every person out there online, those in attendance, again, you’re in my thoughts. You’re in my prayers. It is very challenging. Please don’t give up,” Tsosie said. “Let us keep each other in prayer and let us support one another. And for all of the law enforcement agencies out there, no more excuses. No more excuses. Please work together and let’s get these relatives home. Please.”
Gary Mike, whose daughter Ashlynne Mike, an 11-year-old Diné girl, was kidnapped and murdered on the Navajo Nation in 2016, also spoke to task force members.
“Please listen to all of these passionate people who represent their loved ones,” Mike said. “They are hurting. They’re looking for justice. They’re looking for their loved ones. Please understand, because I have been through that with my daughter Ashlynne.”
A 29-year-old man was sentenced to life imprisonment for her murder in 2017.
Also on Friday, New Mexico Department of Justice staffers shared updates to an online portal listing Indigenous people missing from New Mexico and the Navajo Nation. The portal now includes a tab displaying photos and stories of people who have been killed, submitted by their loved ones. There’s also a tab listing relevant community events.

John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, explains his rationale for cutting some cultural and arts organizations' funding while increasing others on Feb. 21, 2025 (Photo via Montana Public Affairs Network). A state representative who called more than a dozen arts and cultural groups “slackers” and “no-shows” insists that he has no conflict of interest in the legislation, and therefore didn’t need to disclose to fellow lawmakers that his wife was leading the organization that got the largest increase of funds among the 75 groups that applied.
The organization, the St. Timothy’s Summer Music Festival, stands to get nearly three times as much funding from the state as the group had requested, while Rep. John Fitzpatrick, R-Anaconda, pushed to zero out funding requests from other groups.
Fitzpatrick’s wife, Connie, is listed on the application from St. Timothy’s, and used the same email account as one used by Rep. Fitzpatrick in his capacity as a lawmaker to communicate with the group about the funding process.
Fitzpatrick told the Daily Montanan via email on Friday that he isn’t affiliated with the organization, and that as a resident of the smaller Deer Lodge County, he knows many of the residents, which could be interpreted as a conflict of interest virtually anytime someone from the Anaconda area shows up to testify at the Legislature.
“I am not affiliated with the festival, and I do not personally benefit from the appropriation,” Fitzpatrick said.
In fact, he said that he and his wife are financial supporters of it, actually underwriting part of the festival so that it could meet the minimum requirements to apply for state funding, $5,000. The group is currently slated to received $12,500, 143% more than it had originally requested.
But in a fiery legislative meeting in February, dozens of people showed up to protest the way Fitzpatrick had led a budgeting subcommittee dedicated to distributing arts and cultural funding.
Groups from around the state said that for years, they had submitted their grant requests, but had not been required to appear before the legislative subcommittee. In fact, many were told that attending the sessions was not mandatory and would not affect funding, according to multiple residents. However, Fitzpatrick said that he expected that groups or individuals representing the organizations would at least attend via remote video conference to advocate for funding.
He told fellow lawmakers when those groups “no-showed,” he and other committee members decided to zero out the budget requests, leaving larger groups like the Charlie M. Russell Museum in Great Falls and the Alberta Bair Theatre in Billings, along with other smaller organizations, with no grant funding. Fitzpatrick also pointed out that many of the organizations were asking for less than $10,000 but had operational budgets of hundreds of thousands or millions.
Still, for nearly two hours in February, arts and cultural groups railed against the decision, saying that the change was not clearly articulated by the Montana Arts Council, the coordinating agency for the grants. Employees of the council agreed that they had misunderstood the change as well, and hadn’t communicated that testimony was required.
During the hearings and subsequent discussion with lawmakers, Fitzpatrick  didn’t disclose that his wife had submitted an application for a summertime Anaconda music festival, and that the approved funding was more than double what had originally been requested.
He told the Daily Montanan that after nearly two dozen groups did not show up, the subcommittee had a decision: Leave money sitting, or put it to work. So the subcommittee, comprised of both Democrats and Republicans, opted to allocate the funds to groups that had attended, giving many, if not all, more money than they requested, including the St. Timothy’s Summer Music Festival, whose application was submitted by Connie Fitzpatrick.
Rep. Fitzpatrick explained that without her help, the festival was in jeopardy, and she submitted the application to keep it going. He also said that even though additional funds stand to be allocated, a one-to-one funding match requirement means the small musical festival will probably not be able to use more money.
  Amend it or else 

Before HB 9 got out of the full House Appropriations Committee on Thursday, Democrats were concerned about another aspect, political hardball. Democrats said that they had been told that if the amendments to zero out the funding for some of the groups weren’t approved, the entire bill may be killed by the governor or Republican leaders.
“These groups teach children how to dance, how to act, and expose them to music. I served on a school board for six years, and I learned that we ought not punish children for the mistakes adults make,” said Rep. Luke Muszkiewicz, D-Helena. “The good bill sponsor (Fitzpatrick) has said if the amendment doesn’t pass, the whole bill will not.”
Five Democrat representatives voted against amending the bill, but after the fight to restore funding failed, the entire House Appropriations Committee passed the amended bill 22-0.
During executive action on the bill, Fitzpatrick did not deny that bill could be killed if the committee didn’t hold the line on changing the funding.
“I realize it’s a difficult vote for many. It’s not a difficult vote for me,” Fitzpatrick said. “Some of these groups are less than one mile away, and they couldn’t spend five minutes to pick up a $12,000 check, and they failed to do that. Let’s at least take care of the 47 people who had enough pride in their program and enough respect for the legislative process to show up and testify.”
Democrats on the House Appropriations Committee said they were forced into a tough situation: Either reject arts and cultural funding and hurt all the groups, or accept the changes made by Fitzpatrick’s subcommittee that would help some.
In the end, 15 groups had their funding wiped out because they did not show up to the committee. Others had their funding reduced if they only provided written testimony. Those groups that testified — either in person or via video — saw increased funding.
In total, 75 groups asked for, and originally received various amounts, mostly between $12,500 and $13,000.
After the amendment, however, 15 groups were left with zero dollars, while 10 had their grants reduced to $2,000, a roughly 85% cut.
After the amendment, the remaining groups all received an increase in funding to $19,660 to $20,160, a bump of between 55% and 57%.
The only group to receive more than that was St. Timothy’s festival that Connie Fitzpatrick had submitted. That amount rose from $5,000 to $12,160 — an increase of 143%.
During the February meeting, Fitzpatrick said that had any of the organizations showed up and apologized, they may have changed the decision.
Rep. Mary Caferro, the top ranking Democrat on the House Appropriations Committee, said that she didn’t know that Fitzpatrick had a connection to any of the organizations.
“We were really concerned. We felt that they had lost funding inappropriately,” she said, “But we also wanted to support HB 9 because it did provide some projects to get funding at some level.”
She said she does not believe anyone on the Democrats’ side knew of the connection.
“That’s pretty bothersome,” she said. “I don’t remember any disclosing about it.”
At least one other Democrat, though, came to Fitzpatrick’s defense — Sen. Ellie Boldman of Missoula, who sat on the joint subcommittee that made the decision to zero out some grants, a move that she said she supported, even more after the criticism of Fitzpatrick.
Boldman said that in a small state like Montana, lawmakers have close, personal friendships with many who testify before the committees that are never disclosed. Furthermore, she said lawmakers have a responsibility to question every allocation, and they couldn’t do that because some groups did not show up.
“The idea that Rep. Fitzpatrick is the chattel of his wife and he must also disclose her unpaid volunteer connections in the community that we all know Rep. Fitzpatrick represents is also absurd,” Boldman said. “These types of relationships do not rise to any ‘conflict of interest’ and there is no obligation to disclose, and, in my opinion, the whisper and innuendo is unfair and irresponsible.”

But in the first few months of this administration, the practice of law has changed in disturbing ways, and we struggle with how to explain this to our students. Lawyers take an oath to support the Constitution — yet all around us, lawyers are making a mockery of that oath.
Recently, the law firm Paul Weiss capitulated to Donald Trump in a way so brazen and self-defeating that it rattled even those of us already poised to expect cowardice from Big Law. Trump began his campaign of retribution against private law firms that represented clients adverse to him or his allies by revoking the firms’ security clearances and threatening to cancel their clients’ government contracts. A judge halted the first order, directed at the law firm Perkins Coie, stating that it was likely unconstitutional. Nonetheless, Trump then issued a nearly identical order targeting Paul Weiss, and instead of fighting it, Paul Weiss folded.
The firm agreed to give Trump sway over the recipients of $40 million in pro bono services, and, per Trump’s press release, “conduct a comprehensive audit of all its employment practices” and “not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies.” Most chillingly, Trump reported that Paul Weiss “acknowledged the wrongdoing” of former partner Mark Pomerantz, who had worked as a prosecutor in the Manhattan DA’s office on the Trump hush money case.
It is bad enough that Trump is waging this campaign of bald political retribution. It is a different kind of betrayal entirely that Paul Weiss capitulated, especially when the order is likely illegal. Like Skadden and Millbank, which recently negotiated similar deals, Paul Weiss probably believes it is saving its business, but who will employ lawyers in a society devoid of the rule of law?
Lawyers working in this administration would earn failing grades if they were our students. U.S District Court for the Western District of Washington Judge John Cougheneour, granting an injunction against the executive order purporting to end birthright citizenship, said: “Frankly, I have difficulty understanding how a member of the bar would state unequivocally that this is a constitutional order. It just boggles my mind.”
Lawyers appearing before U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge James Boasberg made representations about the expulsion of Venezuelan migrants to El Salvador that the judge deemed “woefully inadequate.” Judge Boasberg has since faced baseless calls for impeachment.
These attacks on the legal profession, the judiciary, and the rule of law are escalating and relentless. Meanwhile, applications for law school are skyrocketing. We’d like to celebrate. Being a lawyer is a wonderful career, full of opportunities to help people and institutions, enable progress, and solve problems. But how can we defend our profession when so many attorneys are aiding this administration’s assault on the rule of law and enabling this constitutional crisis?
For solace, we look to lawyers who are still doing the right thing in the face of these attacks on our profession. Jenner & Block and WilmerHale have both filed suit against the executive orders targeted at them. Other Big Law associates have protested their firms’ silence in the face of Trump’s executive orders targeting firms. Attorneys remaining in the federal government continue to labor in service to the American people, even though Elon Musk and his allies are deriding them as deadweight and decimating their agencies. Others have taken the brave step of resigning when their ethics have been compromised.
Future lawyers have a role to play, too. Our first-year students are preparing their annual moot court arguments, and have practiced how to be persuasive without misleading the court. Upper-level students know to call out and correct the misinterpretation of legal authorities and the misstatement of facts. Outside the classroom, students have been working to connect immigrants to legal resources. Others have used their developing legal expertise to testify for the first time about legislation in the New Hampshire State House.
Our students are a credit to the future of our profession. No matter their political affiliation or philosophical differences, they will swear fealty to the Constitution. Shame on the lawyers currently making a mockery of that oath. The rest of us will continue to fight for the rule of law, because that’s what we promised to do.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold announced Monday that she will run for attorney general in 2026. 
“I am running for Attorney General because Colorado needs a strong, proven leader in this critical moment,” Griswold said in a statement. “I’ll stand up to (President) Donald Trump to protect our rights and freedoms. I’ll fight for working- and middle-class Coloradans, hold big corporations accountable, and safeguard our land, air, and water.”
Griswold, a Democrat, was first elected secretary of state in 2018. She was reelected in 2022 and is term-limited. Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser is also term-limited and announced his run for governor in January. Griswold was initially expected to join the race for governor, but changed course in going for attorney general instead.

As secretary of state, Griswold oversaw implementation of automatic voter registration and supported legislation criminalizing threats to election workers, fake elector schemes and compromising voting equipment.
An outspoken Trump critic, Griswold supported the Colorado Supreme Court’s decision to bar Trump from Colorado’s primary election ballot under the insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment, which the U.S. Supreme Court overturned. She was a defendant in the case filed by six Republican voters in Colorado. Her office also led an investigation into former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, who was convicted for her role in a breach of her own election equipment in an attempt to prove the 2020 election was stolen. 
Griswold faced intense criticism after she disclosed in late October that a document posted to her office’s website included a hidden but accessible worksheet containing passwords to election equipment in counties throughout the state. County clerks said that while election security in the state remained strong following the breach, many were upset that Griswold did not inform them about the breach until after the Colorado Republican Party learned about and announced it.
Early supporters for Griswold’s candidacy include U.S. Rep. Jason Crow, a Centennial Democrat, and Colorado House Majority Leader Monica Duran. Gail Schoettler, former Democratic lieutenant governor and treasurer of Colorado, will serve as Griswold’s campaign chair. 
“Secretary Griswold is the strong leader we need as Attorney General,” Schoettler said in a statement. “As she always has, Jena will stand up to Donald Trump, MAGA extremists, and anyone who threatens the Colorado way of life. And as a woman, she’ll protect reproductive healthcare.”
The attorney general heads the Colorado Department of Law and oversees enforcement of consumer protection and antitrust laws, defends state laws in legal challenges, and advocates for law enforcement and community safety.  
Democratic Boulder District Attorney Michael Dougherty and Democratic former speaker of the Colorado House of Representatives Crisanta Duran are also running for attorney general. Conner Peddington is the only Republican candidate to file paperwork in the race so far. Primary elections to decide party nominees for state offices will be held in June 2026.

“We’re going to follow the law sir. We’ll see you in court,” Gov. Janet Mills told the president in a heated exchange while attending a White House event as part of the National Governors Association winter summit on Feb. 21. 
The Democrat was referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey maintain that law supersedes the president’s edict. 
Mills warned in a statement later that day that the “rule of law in our country” is at stake and that the president will likely continue to target those who speak out against his wishes.
“Maine may be one of the first states to undergo an investigation by his administration, but we won’t be the last,” Mills said.

Maine AG sues Trump administration for USDA funding freeze that hit school meals


By: AnnMarie Hilton - Monday April 7, 2025 2:27 pm












The Maine Attorney General is suing the Trump administration for freezing funds that help feed children in schools and childcare centers, as well as adults with disabilities in congregate settings.
Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint Monday with the U.S. District Court in Maine against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins for their decision to withhold funding because of the state’s alleged violation of Title IX in educational programming.
In a letter sent to Gov. Janet Mills last Wednesday, Rollins that said she was freezing “Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools” and warned it was “only the beginning.” While the letter said the freeze would not affect programs that provide food to children, according to the complaint, the Child Nutrition Program of the Maine Department of Education was unable to access several sources of federal funding the following day.

Pingree calls for acting Social Security director to step down over ‘vindictive actions’


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday April 3, 2025 10:32 am












U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree reiterated her call for Social Security Administration Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek to step down after leaked emails reported on by The Washington Post revealed that he deliberately sought to punish Maine after Gov. Janet Mills’ heated exchange with President Donald Trump over the state’s transgender protections.
On March 6, the Social Security Administration notified the Maine Department of Health and Human Services that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
In a response to an emailed warning from a staff member that the change “would result in improper payments and potential for identity theft,” the acting director made clear that he acting in retaliation.
“While our improper payments will go up, and fraudsters may compromise identities, no money will go from the public trust to a petulant child,” he wrote. 
In a statement Wednesday, Pingree asked, “If a federal agency can be turned into a political hit squad at the whim of an acting appointee, what checks remain on executive power?”
“Commissioner Dudek’s vindictive actions against Maine represent a fundamental betrayal of public trust that disqualifies him from public service. He should not only resign or be removed from office; he should be investigated for his flagrant abuse of power.” 
By March 7, the agency had reversed course after Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins sought answers about the action. A spokesperson for Collins previously told Maine Morning Star that the Republican received a call from Dudek during which he claimed it was done in error.
When asked about the insult, Mills told reporters: “This is the same guy that admitted that he suspended Maine’s enumeration at birth and funeral directors’ program. First, he said it was a mistake, said it was inadvertent, then, God bless, Sen. King and Sen. Collins got after him and then he admitted he did it on purpose because the governor of Maine was not ‘sufficiently cordial to the president and I said, ‘I can’t speak to that.’”

USDA pausing funding to Maine school programs over alleged Title IX violations


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday April 2, 2025 5:35 pm












The U.S. Department of Agriculture is pausing federal funding for some school programs in response to Maine’s alleged violations of Title IX, though the agency has not conducted a formal investigation.
“You cannot openly violate federal law against discrimination in education and expect federal funding to continue unabated,” USDA Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in a letter to Gov. Janet Mills on Wednesday. “Today, I am freezing Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools.
“This is only the beginning,” the letter warned.
School lunch programs, which are funded by the USDA, will not be impacted by the freeze, Rollins said. However, the agency is “reviewing all research and education-related funding in Maine” for compliance with federal anti-discrimination laws “and the priorities of the Trump administration.”
For Maine to continue receiving funding, the state will have to “demonstrate compliance with Title IX’s protection of female student athletes from having to compete with or against or having to appear unclothed before males,” Rollins’ letter said.

Title IX case against Maine schools headed to U.S. Department of Justice

The U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a final warning Monday to the Maine Department of Education regarding its noncompliance with a federal directive for allowing trans girls to participate in girls’ sports.
If the state does not propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office by April 11, the case will be referred to the Department of Justice, the letter said.
Meanwhile, a separate investigation by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights office that found Maine in violation of Title IX for “continuing to unlawfully allow” trans girls to compete in girl’s sports has been referred to the U.S. Department of Justice, according to a Monday social media post from the agency.

Federal probe targets Maine school gender policies, citing parental rights


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Friday March 28, 2025 5:12 pm












District policies that protect students’ privacy when it comes to gender identity might be violating federal law by depriving parents of information, according to the U.S. Department of Education.
In another directed investigation launched by the department based on reports from right-wing media about Maine districts complying with the Maine Human Rights Act, the department alleged that by developing plans to affirm students’ gender, districts may be in violation of the Family Educational Rights Privacy Act (FERPA).
In a letter dated March 28 to the Maine Department of Education, Frank Miller, acting director for the Student Privacy Policy Office, highlighted a 2016 memo by the Maine Human Rights Commission that explains the interpretation of the Act: “In the event that the student and their parent/legal guardian do not agree with regard to the student’s sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression, the educational institution should, whenever possible, abide by the wishes of the student with regard to their gender identity and expression while at school,” the memo states.
“The overall memorandum on its face appears to give school officials discretion that would infringe on the rights of a parent under FERPA,” Miller said in his letter.
He also alleged that “this same rhetoric may lead to Title IX violations if applied in a school environment,” which may warrant the investigation to be referred to the OCR.

Gov. Mills responds to Trump’s demand for apology


By: Lauren McCauley - Monday March 24, 2025 12:49 pm












Gov. Janet Mills responded to President Donald Trump’s demand that she apologize after the Democrat refused to capitulate to an executive order banning transgender girls from student athletics.
“I don’t communicate with public officials by tweet or Instagram or social media,” Mills told reporters, referring to Trump’s weekend post on Truth Social, at a Monday event celebrating the purchase of Bangor mobile home park by its residents.
“Second, all of my issues are about the rule of law pure and simple,” she continued. “It’s not about transgender sports, it is about who makes the laws and who enforces the laws. I read the constitution. Constitution says the president, the chief executive, shall take care that the law be faithfully executed. It doesn’t allow him to make laws out of whole cloth by tweet or Instagram post or press release or executive order that is fundamental law, and I stand for the rule of law and the separation of powers.”
Without naming Trump, Mills went on to say that “if the current occupant of the White House wants to protect women and girls, he should start by protecting the women and teenage girls who are suffering miscarriages and dying because they can’t get basic, life-saving health care in states across this country,” according to the Bangor Daily News.
She added that people in Maine are waiting for an economic plan. “We’ve seen tariffs and threat of tariffs that threaten our economy here in Maine and across the country.”
Last week, the U.S. Department of Education notified Maine that its Department of Education was found in violation of Title IX, a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools, giving the state 10 days to comply. Maine is expected to respond with legal action.

Trump demands Gov. Mills give ‘full-throated apology’


By: Lauren McCauley -  9:14 am












In a post to his Truth Social account early Saturday, President Donald Trump demanded a “full-throated apology” from Gov. Janet Mills, following her refusal to cave to his administration’s order to ban transgender girls from girls sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination.
The Republican president also incorrectly claimed that the state has issued an apology for its policy — something that was swiftly rebutted by Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows, who wrote that, as the “official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal,” she “can confirm ‘State of Maine’ hasn’t apologized.”
Here’s Trump’s full post:
“While the State of Maine has apologized for their Governor’s strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women’s sports while at the White House Governor’s Conference, we have not heard from the Governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases. Therefore, we need a full-throated apology from the Governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the Federal Government again, before this case can be settled. I’m sure she will be able to do that quite easily. Thank you for your attention to this matter and, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! DJT”

U.S. Department of Education determines Maine guilty of violating Title IX


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 20, 2025 10:04 am












The U.S. Department of Education notified Maine late Wednesday that its Department of Education was found in violation of a federal civil rights rule that bans sex-based discrimination in schools.
The letter, addressed to Maine Education Commissioner Pender Makin from the U.S. DOE Office for Civil Rights, said the determination is based on state and district policies that permit transgender girls from participating in girls’ sports. It gives the state ten days to comply with President Donald Trump’s executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sports.
Maine public schools follow the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended in 2021 to include gender identity as a protected class against discrimination. Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination does not reference trans people directly, but the Trump administration is interpreting Maine’s policy as discrimination against cisgender girls.



This finding is the latest among several federal probes launched against the state following a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports.

USDA deems University of Maine System to be in compliance with Title IX


By: Eesha Pendharkar - Wednesday March 19, 2025 5:32 pm












Though the University of Maine System was officially cleared by the U.S. Department of Agriculture of any violations of Title IX, Chancellor Dannel Malloy said the system had been in compliance the entire time, having previously called the probe “an unnecessary distraction.”
UMS follows National Collegiate Athletic Association rules, which were updated last month to ban trans women from women’s sports after President Donald Trump issued an executive order banning transgender girls from playing girls’ sport.
The USDA investigation was among several launched last month as part of federal scrutiny of Maine’s education policies, stemming from a clash between Gov. Janet Mills and Trump over trans inclusion in girls’ sports. USDA froze funds to the university system last week for potential Title IX and Title IV violations, which ban sex and race-based discrimination respectively. After Sen. Susan Collins reportedly intervened with the Trump administration, funding to UMS was restored.
On Wednesday, USDA concluded its compliance review in a news release saying that the university system was in compliance but also warning the rest of the state to follow suit or risk losing funding.
“UMaine’s decision to side with sanity is a win for women and girls in Maine,” the release said. “The choice for the rest of Maine is simple: protect equal opportunities for women, as required by law, or lose funding.”

Trump administration says Maine Principals’ Association, high school violating Title IX


By: Emma Davis - Monday March 17, 2025 7:46 pm












The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office for Civil Rights announced on Monday that it determined the Maine Principals’ Association and Greely High School in Cumberland are each in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports.
On Feb. 21, DHHS issued a notice of violation against the Maine Department of Education for violating that same federal civil rights law, which bans sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges, and on March 5 expanded the compliance review to MPA, which governs sports in Maine, and Greely High School.
According to DHHS, the entities can “voluntarily commit within 10 days to resolve the matter through a signed agreement or risk referral to the U.S. Department of Justice for appropriate action.”   The full agreement, obtained by the Bangor Daily News, can be read here.

USDA backtracks on university funding halt


By: Lauren McCauley - Thursday March 13, 2025 12:30 pm












Two days after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced it would be halting funds to the University of Maine System while it continues its Title IX compliance review, the agency backtracked.
In a statement, Sen. Susan Collins said after consulting with the Trump administration she was alerted that the funding had been restored.
“This USDA funding is critically important not only to the University of Maine, but to our farmers and loggers, as well as to the many people who work in Maine’s agriculture, aquaculture, and forestry industries,” Collins said. “Now that funding has been restored, the work that the University does in partnership with the many people and communities who depend on these programs can continue.”

Amid probe, U.S. Department of Agriculture halts funding to Maine university system


By: Eesha Pendharkar -  12:30 pm












On March 10, just over two weeks after the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced an investigation into the University of Maine System, school leaders received a forwarded email from USDA’s Office of the Chief Financial Officer apparently ordering a temporary pause in funding for the system while the agency evaluates whether it should take any follow-up actions to “prospective Title VI or Title IX violations,” according to a news release from the university system.
“Please take any necessary actions to effectuate this direction from leadership. This pause will remain in effect until further notice,” the USDA email said.
Last fiscal year, USDA awarded $29.78 million to UMaine for research on a wide variety of agriculture innovations and environmental issues, including PFAS contamination on Maine farms, sustainable packaging materials derived from Maine forest-based materials, potato breeding and varietal development, sustainable lobster fishing and support for 4-H youth leadership and STEM skill development programs, which serve tens of thousands of Maine youth every year. 
The University of Southern Maine also has several active USDA awards. 
The state’s public universities are members of the National Collegiate Athletic Association, which banned trans women from women’s sports following Trump’s executive order, and are “operating in a manner entirely consistent with that association’s recently updated policies,” university spokesperson Samantha Warren said.
That means that the funding was halted despite the fact that the system can’t allow trans women to compete on women’s teams.

Social Security snafu puts state on edge


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:29 pm












Another incident that was initially thought to be retaliatory but later deemed an “error” had state officials on edge. 
On March 6, the Portland Press Herald reported that Maine Department of Health and Human Services had been notified by the Social Security Administration that it would be ending the “Enumeration at Birth” process, which allows parents to check a box on a form shortly after a child’s birth in order to receive a mailed Social Security card.
The state agency sent an email to birth certifiers on March 5 alerting them of the change, “effective immediately.”
By March 7, the agency had reversed course while Sens. Angus King and Susan Collins asked for a briefing “to explain why this decision was made at the start.”
A spokesperson for Collins told Maine Morning Star that the Republican did receive a call from Social Security Acting Commissioner Leland Dudek during which he explained it was done in error and let her know it was fully reversed.

Maine Sea Grant to be renegotiated


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












Less than one week after the University of Maine System was notified that funding for the Maine Sea Grant program had been cut, the U.S. Department of Commerce said on March 5 it would “reopen bilateral negotiations” after appeals from members of Maine’s congressional delegation.
Vice Admiral Nancy Hann credited Republican Sen. Susan Collins’ outreach to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick. Independent Sen. Angus King and Rep. Chellie Pingree also sent a letter to Lutnick demanding he immediately reverse the “reckless decision” to terminate the federal grant.

Maine Sea Grant funding cut


By: AnnMarie Hilton -  12:28 pm












The University of Maine said it was notified late Feb. 28 that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration was immediately discontinuing funding for the $4.5 million Maine Sea Grant, according to university spokesperson Samantha Warren. 
The grant has helped finance statewide research, strengthened coastal communities and supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades. 
The Maine Sea Grant fosters coastal workforce development, hands-on marine science education for students of all grade levels, research to inform lobster and other fisheries management, as well as storm preparedness for working waterfronts. 
It has supported thousands of jobs over more than five decades, including 20 current university employees, according to Warren, who said that every federal dollar spent on the program results in $15 of economic activity in the state, amounting to a total annual impact of $23.5 million.
However, the letter from NOAA said the grant’s work is “no longer relevant to the focus of the Administration’s priorities and program objectives.”
Maine’s Sea Grant program is one of 34 across coastal and Great Lakes states throughout the country. However, it appears to have been the only one cut.

Concluding just four days after it was launched, the investigation included no interviews, data requests or negotiations, according to the Maine Attorney General’s Office, which was notified by the agency via emailed letter that the state had violated Title IX, the federal law banning sex-based discrimination in schools and colleges. The letter also handed the case over to the U.S. Department of Justice —  a rare outcome for such a probe.
The lack of process followed by the agency’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) defies decades of precedent, according to Jackie Wernz, a former OCR lawyer for the U.S. Department of Education who now represents schools nationwide in such cases. Within any federal agency, the OCR typically conducts lengthy investigations with fact-finding, interviews and legal analysis of how exactly the agency under investigation violated federal laws the office is tasked with upholding, including Title IX.
But in this case, OCR simply appears to be enforcing the Trump administration’s stance on trans athletes, according to Wernz. 
If Maine does not sue or comply, the department could withhold funds from the state as soon as 10 days after the notice, which was sent on Feb. 25. While the letter does not go into detail about the exact amount of funding that could be withheld, Maine received more than $700,000 from HHS in 2024.

U.S. Department of Agriculture Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:26 pm












On Feb. 22, the U.S. Department of Agriculture notified Maine Gov. Janet Mills and University of Maine System Chancellor Dannel Malloy that it had also launched a Title IX review. 
As a land grant university, the University of Maine System receives funding from the agency’s Agricultural Research Service and National Institute of Food and Agriculture, which in recent years totaled over $100 million, according to USDA Acting General Counsel Ralph Linden. 
“Should the University of Maine or other entities receiving funds from USDA be found to be out of compliance, additional funding may be in jeopardy,” Linden wrote.

U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Title IX investigation


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:25 pm












On Feb. 21, the same day that the U.S. Department of Education announced its investigation into Maine, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ civil rights division quickly followed suit. 
The agency said it was initiating a compliance review of the Maine Department of Education, including the University of Maine System, “based on information that Maine intends to defy” the president’s executive order on transgender athletes.
“The investigation will examine whether the State of Maine engaged in discrimination on the basis of sex under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, as amended, and its HHS implementing regulation,” the announcement read.

U.S. Department of Education Title IX review


By: Lauren McCauley -  12:24 pm












Hours after Mills and Trump traded barbs, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights announced it was launching a Title IX investigation into the Maine Department of Education as well as Maine School Administrative District 51, which is based in Cumberland, in response to reports that Greely High School is “continuing to allow at least one male student to compete in girls’ categories.”
The agency is arguing that Maine schools’ adherence to the protections in the Maine Human Rights Act is in violation of Title IX, which prohibits sex-based discrimination in any school or any other education program that receives federal funding.
In response, Mills issued a statement saying the effort to “withhold federal funding authorized and appropriated by Congress and paid for by Maine taxpayers in an attempt to coerce someone into compliance with his will” is “a violation of our Constitution and of our laws, which I took an oath to uphold.”",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/donaldtrumpfeb112025_0-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-07 15:08:55.690627

(Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)The West Virginia House of Delegates has signed off on legislation that would require municipalities to hold their elections on the same day as state elections. Delegates passed Senate Bill 50 Monday with a vote of 96 to 2. 
Supporters of the bill say requiring municipalities to have their elections along with state elections will save cities and towns money and encourage voter turnout. According to the West Virginia Secretary of State’s Office, 113 municipalities across the state will have their elections in 2025, which is not a year for state elections. 
Morgantown’s election, for instance, is scheduled for April 29. Bridgeport’s election will be June 10. 
Under the version of the bill passed by the House, cities and towns have until 2028 to hold their elections on the same day as state elections. Delegates approved the change in a floor amendment offered by Del. Geno Chiarelli, R-Monongalia, on Friday. 
The Senate passed the bill unanimously on March 3. In the Senate’s version of the bill, the deadline was 2032. Those who advocated for a later deadline have said that some municipalities established their election dates in their charter, and that changing the charters may require an election. Others argued that state law would supersede municipal law and allow cities and towns to change the dates sooner. 
The Secretary of State’s Office also supported a later deadline, saying in a statement that it would allow more time for municipalities to conduct local redistricting for any conflicts with geographic, precinct and political districts. Redistricting is especially an issue for smaller municipalities, a spokesman for the office said. 
Del. Larry Kump, R-Berkeley, spoke in support of the bill Monday, saying that in his district, Hedgesville and Martinsburg have low voter turnout because of “weird” election days.
“By mandating that all West Virginia elections are held on normal election dates, Senate Bill 50 will eliminate the taxpayer burden of holding these special elections, but importantly, will also increase voter awareness and election turnout,” Kump said. 
He relayed a story about moving to West Virginia years ago and asking about cities’ having “weird” election days. He said he was told that the off-year elections entrench government officials by ensuring that their friends come out to vote for them but others stay home, unaware of the election.
The bill will now go back to the Senate to consider the change the House made to the bill.

(Photo by Amanda Mills/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention)The Maine Attorney General is suing the Trump administration for freezing funds that help feed children in schools and childcare centers, as well as adults with disabilities in congregate settings.
Attorney General Aaron Frey filed a complaint Monday with the U.S. District Court in Maine against the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Secretary Brooke Rollins for their decision to withhold funding because of the state’s alleged violation of Title IX in educational programming. 
Title IX does not reference trangender people directly, but the Trump administration has interpreted Maine’s policy allowing trans students to compete in athletics that align with the gender identity as discrimination against cisgender girls. 
“Under the banner of keeping children safe, the Trump administration is illegally withholding grant funds that go to keeping children fed,” Frey said in a Monday news release.
In a letter sent to Gov. Janet Mills last Wednesday, Rollins that said she was freezing “Maine’s federal funds for certain administrative and technological functions in schools” and warned it was “only the beginning.” While the letter said the freeze would not affect programs that provide food to children, according to the complaint, the Child Nutrition Program of the Maine Department of Education was unable to access several sources of federal funding the following day.

“This is just another example where no law or consequence appears to restrain the administration as it seeks capitulation to its lawlessness,” Frey said. “The President and his cabinet secretaries do not make the law and they are not above the law, and this action is necessary to remind the President that Maine will not be bullied into violating the law.”
In the complaint, Frey argues that the freeze is unlawful because it did not follow the legally required procedure to alter congressionally appropriated funds, including a regulation from the USDA to hold a hearing and issue a formal decision on the record before terminating funds. 
Frey is also asking for a temporary restraining order to prevent the USDA from withholding funds while the court hears the matter. 
The funding freeze was among a barrage of actions targeting Maine following President Donald Trump and Mills’ heated exchange over the state’s protections for transgender student athletes.
Both the U.S. Departments of Education and Health and Human Services determined Maine’s polices allowing transgender girls to compete in girls’ sports, which is supported by the Maine Human Rights Act, violate federal protections against sex-based discrimination in schools. 
The U.S. DOE gave Maine a deadline of April 11 to propose an agreement that’s acceptable to the office or said the case will be referred to the Department of Justice.
Frey’s complaint marks the first official legal action in the dispute. However, the complaint specifically notes that it is asking the court to rule on the legality of the freeze rather than to interpret Title IX, though that question will likely come before the courts soon. 
“Even if the State of Maine were in violation of Title IX (and, to be clear, it is not), there are statutory and regulatory requirements that the federal government must comply with before it may freeze federal funds owed to a state,” he wrote.

BOULDER, Colo. — Colorado regulators are issuing licenses for providing psychedelic mushrooms and are planning to authorize the state’s first “healing centers,” where the mushrooms can be ingested under supervision, in late spring or early summer.
The dawn of state-regulated psychedelic mushrooms has arrived in Colorado, nearly two years since Oregon began offering them. The mushrooms are a Schedule I drug and illegal under federal law except for clinical research. But more than a dozen cities nationwide have deprioritized or decriminalized them in the past five years, and many eyes are turned toward Oregon’s and Colorado’s state-regulated programs.
“In Oregon and Colorado, we’re going to learn a lot about administration of psychedelics outside of clinical, religious and underground settings because they’re the first to try this in the U.S.,” said William R. Smith, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine.
Psychedelic mushrooms and their psychoactive compound psilocybin have the potential to treat people with depression and anxiety, including those unresponsive to other medications or therapy. The National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health, says the risk of mental health problems caused by ingesting mushrooms in a supervised clinical setting is low, but may be higher outside of a clinical setting. Robert F. Kennedy Jr. said in a social media post last year, before his nomination as U.S. health secretary, that his “mind is open to the idea of psychedelics for treatment.”
Medical experts say more research is needed, particularly in people with a diagnosis or family history of psychotic or bipolar disorder. Adverse effects of psilocybin, including headache and nausea, typically resolve within one to two days. However, extended difficulties from using psychedelics can last weeks, months or years; anxiety and fear, existential struggle, social disconnection and feeling detached from oneself and one’s surroundings are most common. After the decriminalization and legalization in Oregon and Colorado, psychedelic mushroom exposures reported to poison control centers ticked up in these states and nationally.
In February, about 40 people organized by the psychedelic advocacy group the Nowak Society gathered in Boulder to talk about the coming changes in Colorado. They included Mandy Grace, who received her state license to administer psychedelic mushrooms, and Amanda Clark, a licensed mental health counselor from Denver, who both praised the therapeutic power of mushrooms.
“You get discouraged in your practice because the current therapies are not enough for people,” Clark said.
Colorado voters approved Proposition 122 in 2022 to legalize natural psychedelics, after Oregon voters in 2020 approved legalizing psilocybin for therapeutic use. Colorado’s program is modeled after, but not the same as, Oregon’s, under which 21,246 psilocybin products have been sold as of March, a total that could include secondary doses, according to the Oregon Health Authority.
As of mid-March, Colorado has received applications for at least 15 healing center licenses, nine cultivation licenses, four manufacturer licenses and one testing facility license for growing and preparing the mushrooms, under rules developed over two years by the governor-appointed Natural Medicine Advisory Board.
Psychedelic treatments in Oregon are expensive, and are likely to be so in Colorado, too, said Tasia Poinsatte, Colorado director of the nonprofit Healing Advocacy Fund, which supports state-regulated programs for psychedelic therapy. In Oregon, psychedelic mushroom sessions are typically $1,000 to $3,000, are not covered by insurance, and must be paid for up front.

The mushrooms themselves are not expensive, Poinsatte said, but a facilitator’s time and support services are costly, and there are state fees. In Colorado, for doses over 2 milligrams, facilitators will screen participants at least 24 hours in advance, then supervise the session in which the participant consumes and experiences mushrooms, lasting several hours, plus a later meeting to integrate the experience.
Facilitators, who may not have experience with mental health emergencies, need training in screening, informed consent and postsession monitoring, Smith said. “Because these models are new, we need to gather data from Colorado and Oregon to ensure safety.”
Facilitators generally pay a $420 training fee, which allows them to pursue the necessary consultation hours, and roughly $900 a year for a license, and healing centers pay $3,000 to $6,000 for initial licenses in Colorado. But the up-front cost for facilitators is significant: The required 150 hours in a state-accredited program and 80 hours of hands-on training can cost $10,000 or more, and Clark said she wouldn’t pursue a facilitator license due to the prohibitive time and cost.
To increase affordability for patients in Colorado, Poinsatte said, healing centers plan to offer sliding-scale pay options, and discounts for veterans, Medicaid enrollees and those with low incomes. Group sessions are another option to lower costs.
Colorado law does not allow retail sales of psilocybin, unlike cannabis, which can be sold both recreationally and medically in the state. But it allows adults 21 and older to grow, use and share psychedelic mushrooms for personal use.
Despite the retail ban, adjacent businesses have mushroomed. Inside the warehouse and laboratory of Activated Brands in Arvada, brown bags of sterilized grains such as corn, millet and sorghum and plastic bags of soil substrate are for sale, along with genetic materials and ready-to-grow kits.
Co-founder Sean Winfield sells these supplies for growing psychedelic or functional mushrooms such as lion’s mane to people hoping to grow their own at home. Soon, Activated Brands will host cultivation and education classes for the public, Winfield said.
Winfield and co-founder Shawn Cox recently hosted a psychedelic potluck at which experts studying and cultivating psychedelic mushrooms discussed genetics, extraction and specialized equipment.
Psychedelic mushrooms have a long history in Indigenous cultures, and provisions for their use in spiritual, cultural or religious ceremonies are included in Colorado law, along with recognition of the cultural harm that could occur to federally recognized tribes and Indigenous people if natural medicine is overly commercialized or exploited.
Several studies over the past five years have shown the long-term benefits of psilocybin for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder, and the Food and Drug Administration designated it a breakthrough therapy. Late-stage trials, often a precursor to application for FDA approval, are underway.
Smith said psilocybin is a promising tool for treating mental health disorders but has not yet been shown to be better than other advanced treatments. Joshua Woolley, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of California-San Francisco, said he has seen the benefits of psilocybin as an investigator in clinical trials.
“People can change hard-set habits. They can become unstuck. They can see things in new ways,” he said of treating patients with a combination of psilocybin and psychotherapy.
Colorado, unlike Oregon, allows integration of psilocybin into existing mental health and medical practices with a clinical facilitator license, and through micro-healing centers that are more limited in the amounts of mushrooms they can store.
Still, Woolley said, between the federal ban and new state laws for psychedelics, this is uncharted territory. Most drugs used to treat mental health disorders are regulated by the FDA, something that Colorado is “taking into its own hands” by setting up its own program to regulate manufacturing and administration of psilocybin.
The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Colorado declined to comment on its policy toward state-regulated psychedelic programs or personal use provisions, but Poinsatte hopes the same federal hands-off approach to marijuana will be taken for psilocybin in Oregon and Colorado.
Winfield said he looks forward to the upcoming rollout and potential addition of other plant psychedelics, such as mescaline. “We’re talking about clandestine industries coming into the light,” he said.

(Getty Images)A member of the House of Representatives is trying to exempt the Federal Aviation Administration Academy in Oklahoma City from any future government shutdowns.
The school churns out thousands of trained air traffic controllers at a time when there’s a national shortage. The legislation introduced by Rep. Frank Lucas would keep the academy at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, one of the FAA’s largest facilities, open if funds stopped flowing due to a federal government shutdown and would exempt employees and students employed by the FAA from a furlough.
“In recent times because of the challenges we’ve had with air safety, because of the tragic crashes — think about the near misses — there’s no more important time than now to have a steady stream of capable, talented, well-prepared people to be in those towers,” Lucas, whose district is home to the academy, said.

He was referring, in part, to the deadly plane crash outside of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport earlier this year. But Lucas also said that he was concerned about the facility in the context of potential cuts from the Department of Government Efficiency.
The air traffic controller workforce, which has been shrinking for decades, has received an outsized amount of attention recently as concern over flight safety has grown. Senators have questioned whether it is safe to fly after the administration laid off several hundred probationary workers at the FAA. Those layoffs included workers at the Mike Monroney Aeronautical Center, according to KFOR-TV.
Lucas already has some interest in his bill across the Capitol.
“Congressman Frank Lucas is a very good friend of mine, and I’m very supportive about anything he does,” Sen. Markwayne Mullin said.
The aeronautical center trains 76,000 students in aviation fields annually, according to its website. About 1,000 students attend the school each day, according to an academy student handbook from 2023.
Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy toured the academy in February, then rolled out a plan to recruit more air traffic controllers that included boosting starting salaries for those who attend the school.
“Today’s visit reaffirmed how being an air traffic controller is one of the best, most rewarding jobs in America, and that the next generation at the Academy is the best in the world,” Duffy said in a news release. “This staffing shortage has been a known challenge for over a decade, and this administration is committed to solving it.”
Lucas pointed to the most recent government shutdown as a “total disruption” to the process of bringing in and training students.
“You upset the flow of folks making plans to come, and the FAA’s ability to absorb the people they expect to be coming out of each class,” Lucas said. “It’s just chaos.”
The previous shutdown was the first thing that came to Sen. James Lankford’s mind when asked about the bill, which he said he supports.
“The academy had to start all over again. We lost a session to the shutdown,” Lankford said, adding that Lucas is “basically just saying, we can declare that it’s essential. We’ve got to have more air traffic control folks.”
Lucas said he was concerned for the facility after President Donald Trump launched DOGE because it was looking at “anything and everything.” But Lucas’ concern wasn’t limited to the academy, he said. It also extended to “any number of things,” including food safety inspections.
“My job is to work with the administration, whoever the administration is, work with my colleagues, whoever they may be, and try and make sure that wise decisions are made,” Lucas said. “We helped DOGE on a couple of issues, in a general sense, see that perhaps things should be done differently.”

(Photo by Lance Cheung/USDA)A group of Iowans is suing the State of Iowa, alleging Gov. Kim Reynolds has no authority to require agencies such as the Department of Natural Resources to adopt regulations that are less burdensome on industry.
The lawsuit was filed recently in Polk County District Court by Steve Veysey, a fly fisherman and clean-water advocate from Ames; Kathy Carter, a Floyd County resident who says her city’s drinking water is pulled from a source affected by a water-withdrawal permit benefitting an ethanol plant; and Mary Powell, heir to a Shelby County farm through which a hazardous- liquid pipeline is routed.
The plaintiffs claim Reynolds’ Executive Order 10, issued in January 2023, diminishes the effectiveness of regulations that are supposed to protect landowners from the environmental and economic damages caused by a pipeline.

The governor, the lawsuit claims, has “no authority to manipulate the rulemaking process prior to a final rule being adopted,” and so “any regulation adopted in compliance with Executive Order 10 is illegal and void.”
The governor’s order dictated that each state agency, board and commission repeal and replace all existing rules by Dec. 31, 2026.  In doing so, the order stated, the agencies, boards and commissions must “reduce the overall regulatory burden, or remain neutral, as compared to the previous rule.”
According to the lawsuit, Reynolds’ order “ignores the benefits” of previously existing rules.
“Unchecked corporate actions often result in damage to people and the environment,” the lawsuit claims. “The order then alleges that there is a regulatory burden on Iowans. The regulatory burden is not on Iowans. If there is a regulatory burden, it is on business and industry, which seems to be the only thing the governor’s action is concerned about.”
The lawsuit alleges all proposed rule changes must first be cleared by her administrative rules coordinator they can even be considered for the rulemaking and approval process.
As an example, the lawsuit cites a DNR proposal to change requirements related to the construction of manure storage facilities and says those proposed changes “were not allowed” to be brought forward to the administrative rules coordinator. “There is no authority in the statute for the governor to veto a rule, or a portion of a draft rule, before it is even presented to the public,” the lawsuit alleges.
While the governor’s order does not prohibit public comment on proposed rule changes, the lawsuit claims, “it renders that comment meaningless, because it ties the agency’s hands from considering that comment if the result would be regulations that violate the dictates of the executive order.”
The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment that the executive order is beyond the governor’s authority and that any agency rules adopted in compliance with that order be deemed illegal and invalid.
The state has yet to respond to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the Iowa attorney general’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A new property tax plan from Indiana House Republicans prevailed over qualms from Democrats on Monday, advancing to the House floor for further considerations after the 15-8 committee vote.
Senate Bill 1 would now let counties increase their local income taxes and — for the first time — allow cities to implement their own local income taxes. Under a massive amendment adopted Monday, counties would be able to levy an income tax up to 2.9%, up from the current 2.5% cap, while cities could go up to 1.2%. 
The legislation would also phase out, by 2030, the business personal property tax on anything purchased this year or later.

Democrats balked at voting for the 368-page amendment without any fiscal foresight. The Legislative Services Agency doesn’t draft fiscal notes on amendments until they’re adopted. 
“(This) is not ready for prime time,” said Rep. Greg Porter, D-Indianapolis. “We still have a lot of movement on it to get it to the point that we can even entertain it, as Democrats.”
Amendment author Rep. Jeff Thompson, R-Lizton, said it balances local government funding needs with relief for homeowners.
“Ninety-three percent (of homeowners) will pay less than they would have without this bill,” said Thompson, who chairs the committee. “Fifty-five percent will actually pay less in pay ‘26 than pay ‘25 and we do know that it’s roughly $200 per home.”
Thompson said that analysts hoped to release an updated fiscal note on the new property tax plan by this evening.

Dr. Nicole Bryce, a resident physician from Charleston is worried about what’s happening with health care in the country.
“I’m an OBGYN, and I’m very passionate about women’s health and the state of health care in our country,” Bryce said. “I also have lots of young kids and I’m very concerned about their education and their future.”

Terri Walker, a teacher from Marion County, never felt the need to attend a protest until Trump was elected.
“Everything that he stands for, represents, is anti who I am as a human being,” Walker said. “So, whatever I can do, to make my voice be heard and to let anybody know I am not in favor of this  administration. None of the fools.”

(Screenshot courtesy USFS)A provision in the secret, controversial agreement allowing a private company to transport uranium ore across the Arizona side of the Navajo Nation has New Mexico anti-nuclear advocates increasingly worried about the prospect of new mining activity near a mountain sacred to the Navajo people.
The Navajo Nation in late January agreed to let Energy Fuels transport uranium ore from its Pinyon Plains Mine in Arizona to its mill in White Mesa, Utah. Neither party has released the agreement, calling it confidential, they have described what it says in broad terms, and a transport policy, overseen by the United States Forest Service, details plans in case of an emergency. 
Two to three truckloads a day are making the trek across the western edge of the Navajo Nation into Utah, officials have said at recent public meetings. That number could increase to 10, said Stephen Etsitty, director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, at recent chapter house meetings, according to video attendees shared on social media. 
In exchange, Energy Fuels agreed to pay the Navajo Nation $1.2 million and also clean up as much as 10,000 tons of material from old uranium mines for free. Energy Fuels would also pay the nation 50 cents per pound of uranium processed at the mill. 
Energy Fuels also owns the Roca Honda mine near Mount Taylor in New Mexico. The shortest route from Roca Honda to the White Mesa Mill in Utah also runs through the Navajo Nation. 
Energy Fuels spokesperson Curtis Moore declined to say exactly what the transport agreement said regarding the Roca Honda mine, citing the agreement’s confidentiality. But he did acknowledge the agreement contemplated the New Mexico mine’s eventual operation. 
“If Roca Honda were to proceed, we agreed to take quite a bit more cleanup material at no charge to the Navajo Nation,” Moore said in an email Friday to Source New Mexico. 
‘How are we going to beat this monster?’
Cheyenne Antonio, an advocate with Diné C.A.R.E, told Source that she asked Navajo Nation officials at a recent meeting about the prospect of uranium transport in New Mexico. She said Stephen Etsitty, executive director of the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency, told her that no roads had been approved yet in New Mexico for uranium transport. 
Etsitty told Source New Mexico on Monday that it’s far too early to say what the route could be, but that the Cibola National Forest has presented some options in old draft environmental impact statements in the mine.
Estimates Etsitty has reviewed show that far more trucks would cross the Navajo Nation each day from the Roca Honda mine, based on assessments of the amount of uranium could produce. Between 50 and 60 trucks a day is the maximum, Etsitty said.
The Navajo Nation has, for years, opposed the development of any mine near Mount Taylor, known as Tsoodził in Navajo, Etsitty said.
But if the Roca Honda mine is approved, Etsitty said the new transport agreement contains “a framework” that would require Energy Fuels to remove 30,000 more tons of abandoned uranium mine material, on top of the 10,000 tons the company has already promised to remove as part of the Pinyon Plains transport agreement.
Energy Fuels pushed for the provision, Etsitty said, because the company believes it is far enough along in getting that mine approved that it was necessary.
“We looked at it and and we agreed, but we also stipulated that we were not waiving, we were not pre-judging, nothing was pre-decisional,” he said in a phone interview Monday with Source New Mexico. “Meaning that we were not agreeing with them that we support the Roca Honda project. Because we reserved our right to comment fully and vigorously on that project.”
The company has listed the Roca Honda project as in the “advanced” stage of permitting on its website, but the website has said that since at least 2019, according to the Internet archive.
Antonio and Leona Morgan, who heads up Haul No!, a group opposing the transport agreement, organized a small gathering at an Albuquerque library on Thursday to discuss the latest on uranium mining in Arizona and New Mexico and brainstorm ideas to oppose its extraction and transport.

“My question,” Morgan asked those in attendance, “is what is our solution to fighting it? How are we going to deal with it? How are we going to beat this monster?”
Uranium mining between the 1940s and the 1970s in and around the Navajo Nation left cancer and pollution in its wake. Companies operating in the area back then abandoned hundreds of uranium mines that continue to poison groundwater and otherwise hurt public health. 
So the prospect of new mining and its transport has incensed members of the Navajo Nation, Antonio said. At a meeting late last month at the Mexican Water Chapter in Utah, one elder woman spoke up to say, in Navajo, that the agreement amounted to the tribe killing the Navajo way of life without members’ input. 
“You agreed to kill our whole Navajo universe without our consent,” the elder said, according to Antonio’s translation.
Moore, the Energy Fuels spokesperson, noted that the company had nothing to do with the legacy uranium mines, which were drilled to produce weapons material, and that it is doing its part as “good samaritans” to clean up the old companies’ messes. 
“Our uranium is only used for clean, carbon-free … nuclear energy, not weapons,” Moore said. 
‘The Trump administration is moving quickly’
While outside observers and both parties to the agreement agree many hurdles remain in the way of the state’s first new uranium mine in more than 50 years, they see the transport agreement as the latest domino to fall. 
Already this year, Cibola National Forest officials deemed the Roca Honda mine a “priority project,” following an executive order from President Donald Trump seeking to boost domestic energy production. Trump’s pushes to make public lands profitable and his newly announced tariffs could also point in the direction of new uranium mines here, Moore said. 
“Roca Honda is a large and high-grade uranium deposit that could enhance U.S. energy independence considerably,” Moore said. “We are not sure what the executive orders mean yet in terms of concrete actions. However, the Trump administration is moving quickly to reduce America’s dependence on Russian and Chinese uranium and rare earth imports, which are the two commodities Energy Fuels produces today.”
Long-stalled NM uranium mines now ‘priority projects’ at Cibola Forest, leader tells employees

As for tariffs, Moore said the taxes on imports could “support domestic uranium and rare earth production.” 
Also, the price of uranium has risen steadily since 2020, including cresting at a little more than $100 a pound last January. That’s close to the point at which new mines are profitable, according to Eric Jantz, legal director at the New Mexico Environmental Law Center. 
Etsitty, speaking to a small crowd gathered at a chapter house in Crownpoint last month, said the price hitting $100 last January is what prompted the new speculation in and around the Navajo Nation. 
“That’s what drives all of this. When people say, what is this all about? Is it just about money? Yes, it’s just about money to the industry,” Etsitty said. 
Moore said regulatory review can take years, even decades, for a new mine, especially if anti-mining interests get in the way. 
“Anti-nuclear and anti-mining interests can severely delay good domestic mining projects,” he wrote. “Therefore, we would welcome any shortening of permitting timelines, and reductions in ‘lawfare’ and nuisance lawsuits, to get domestic critical mineral projects into production to support energy, economic and national security quickly.” 
Navajo Nation officials have defended the agreement as the best deal they could strike in the face of a lawsuit they feel they would likely lose. In the Crownpoint meeting and a question-and-answer virtual meeting shortly after they struck the agreement, Nation officials cited the Supremacy clause of the United States Constitution, which they said pre-empts the tribe’s right to restrict uranium transport over roads that course through the Navajo Nation. 
“We are supportive of the overarching desire to not have these functioning and operating, but we can’t stop it,” Etsitty said in the meeting. “So now we’re trying to manage it.”

,DC,2025-04-07 17:15:14+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump DOJ asks U.S. Supreme Court to block order to return wrongly deported Maryland man,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-doj-asks-us-supreme-court-block-order-return-wrongly-deported-maryland-man,,"WASHINGTON —  The Trump administration made an emergency appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court on Monday, asking the justices to strike down a lower court’s order that immigration officials return a Maryland man erroneously deported to a notorious mega-prison in El Salvador. U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer argued that, despite an error in deporting Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia of Beltsville, Maryland, the lower court does not have the jurisdiction to order the Trump administration to return someone who the administration argues is no longer in U.S. custody.The appeal to the high court came within minutes of an appeals court panel unanimously upholding the order by U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis, who set a deadline of midnight Monday for the administration to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.Despite being granted legal protection from deportation by a judge in 2019, immigration officials detained Abrego Garcia and sent him on a March 15 deportation flight to El Salvador, where he was incarcerated at the notorious prison known as Centro de Confinamiento del Terrorismo, or CECOT.‘The government screwed up’A panel of three judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit agreed Abrego Garcia’s deportation to El Salvador was a major misstep.“The United States Government has no legal authority to snatch a person who is lawfully present in the United States off the street and remove him from the country without due process,” two judges on the panel, Robert B. King and Stephanie D. Thacker, wrote.King was appointed by former President Bill Clinton and Thacker was appointed by former President Barack Obama.“The Government’s contention otherwise, and its argument that the federal courts are powerless to intervene, are unconscionable,” they wrote.J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was appointed by former President Ronald Reagan, wrote in his option that “[t]here is no question that the government screwed up here.”He noted that President Donald Trump’s administration has not made an effort to rectify its mistake.“The facts of this case thus present the potential for a disturbing loophole: namely that the government could whisk individuals to foreign prisons in violation of court orders and then contend, invoking its Article II powers, that it is no longer their custodian, and there is nothing that can be done. It takes no small amount of imagination to understand that this is a path of perfect lawlessness, one that courts cannot condone,” Wilkinson said.Order to returnOn Friday, Xinis ordered the Trump administration to return Abrego Garcia.The Department of Justice quickly appealed the decision and Xinis issued a scathing 22-page order Sunday that cited records and official statements from Trump officials saying the administration has the power to return Abrego Garcia to the U.S.“Neither the United States nor El Salvador have told anyone why he was returned to the very country to which he cannot return, or why he is detained at CECOT,” she wrote. “That silence is telling. As Defendants acknowledge, they had no legal authority to arrest him, no justification to detain him, and no grounds to send him to El Salvador—let alone deliver him into one of the most dangerous prisons in the Western Hemisphere.”Abrego Garcia was on one of three deportation flights to CECOT on March 15. Two flights contained 238 Venezuelans who were deported under a wartime law that is currently being challenged in another court case.Xinis slammed the Trump administration for arguing that she had no jurisdiction to order Abrego Garcia’s return.“For the following reasons, their jurisdictional arguments fail as a matter of law,” she said. “Further, to avoid clear irreparable harm, and because equity and justice compels it, the Court grants the narrowest, daresay only, relief warranted: to order that Defendants return Abrego Garcia to the United States.”She noted that the two countries have an agreement to house more than 250 deported men at CECOT.The U.S. is paying El Salvador $6 million to detain the men at the prison. Trump is scheduled to meet with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele at the White House on April 14.In response to the district court’s order to return Abrego Garcia, the president of El Salvador, Nayib Bukele, posted a GIF of a confused cartoon bunny on social media.Attorney placed on leaveThe Department of Justice attorney who argued on behalf of the Trump administration, Erez Reuveni, was placed on indefinite administrative leave over the weekend.U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said during a Fox News interview Sunday that Reuveni was placed on leave because he did not “vigorously” defend the administration.Reuveni, a veteran government attorney, has argued for the DOJ over the course of four administrations.During Friday’s hearing he was candid that the Trump administration had provided him little information on why Abrego Garcia could not be returned to the U.S. and that “the government made a choice here to produce no evidence.”",,,,2025-04-07 13:24:03.437056

From extreme gerrymandering to relentless and restrictive voter ID laws, we’ve seen lawmakers chip away at our freedom to vote under the false guise of “election integrity.” 
Now, we’re witnessing it again with the Trump Administration’s newest attempted power grab—an unconstitutional Executive Order that would do nothing to protect elections but would do plenty to strip eligible voters of their constitutional right to vote. It’s the latest move in an authoritarian playbook designed to make voting harder—all while masquerading as an effort to protect the security of our elections. This Executive Order is blatantly unconstitutional and is a clear distraction from the real issue at hand: the SAVE Act which, if enacted, would disenfranchise millions of voters by requiring proof of citizenship.  
At first glance, requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote might seem like common sense, but in reality, it throws up unnecessary roadblocks for eligible voters, disproportionately impacting people of color, naturalized citizens, and elderly residents. North Carolina lawmakers have been playing this game for years, throwing up obstacles, creating confusion, and manufacturing fear to keep certain voices out of the process. This order is just the latest chapter in that shameful playbook.
As the data have shown, time and again: noncitizen voting is not a widespread problem. In fact, multiple studies and election audits have confirmed that such cases are virtually nonexistent. Yet lawmakers keep pushing this myth to justify proposed ballot measures and laws that would make it harder for eligible citizens to vote. This bill isn’t about protecting elections—it’s about creating barriers, fueling fear, and silencing voters who don’t fit their agenda.
I’ve spoken with naturalized citizens who have spent years navigating our immigration system, proudly earning their right to vote—only to now face another bureaucratic nightmare to prove their citizenship. I’ve heard from elderly Black voters born in the Jim Crow South, whose births were never formally recorded, and who now fear they’ll be turned away at the polls. And I know working mothers, like myself, who have changed their last names after marriage, only to find that mismatched documents could threaten their ability to vote. These aren’t hypotheticals; they are real people, our neighbors, who will be disenfranchised.
I experienced these complications firsthand when I voted in the 2016 primary. I walked into my polling place with my three-month-old baby, having just legally changed my name. I did everything right—I updated my name with the DMV and changed my voter registration to match. But when I arrived, I learned that my registration hadn’t been processed due to an error. The only way I could vote was under my maiden name, which was allowed under the law at the time. This wasn’t my mistake—it was a failure of the system. With this executive order, even more voters will face similar obstacles—except they might not be so fortunate.
It’s shameful and disheartening to see our North Carolina legislators and elected leaders, like Representative Don Davis, working against voters’ best interests by actively supporting legislation that would make it harder for North Carolinians to make their voices heard. If our leaders truly cared about election security, they’d be working to expand voter access, modernize our election systems, and ensure that every eligible voter can cast their ballot without jumping through unnecessary hoops. Instead, our elected leaders are resorting to fear-mongering and deception to push an agenda that serves their own interests, not the American people nor the people of North Carolina. 
North Carolinians must stand against the SAVE Act, the Executive Order, and any other efforts to make voting harder. Our democracy is strongest when every eligible voter can cast their ballot freely and fairly. We cannot allow self-serving lawmakers to strip away our rights under the pretense of security. It’s time to push back against these attacks and demand a system that works for all of us—not just those in power.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Georgia-voters.jpg,,,2025-04-07 13:24:03.437056

The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.

“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”

A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.

“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”

Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

Kennedy Jr.'s layoffs included numerous staff at health agencies responsible for releasing public records,"Health experts say Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s firing of public records staffers at federal health agencies undercuts his promise to deliver “radical transparency.” (Eric Harkleroad/KFF Health News)Public access to government records that document the handling of illnesses, faulty products, and safety lapses at health facilities will slow after mass firings at the federal Department of Health and Human Services swept out staff members responsible for releasing records, according to transparency advocates and health experts.
HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.’s layoffs across health agencies in recent days eliminated workers who handled Freedom of Information Act requests at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cut FOIA staff at the FDA and the National Institutes of Health, said six current and former federal workers KFF Health News agreed not to name because they fear retaliation and are not authorized to speak to the press.
FOIA is a transparency law that guarantees public access to the inner workings of federal agencies by requiring officials to release government documents. The 1966 law is a crucial tool for law firms, advocates, businesses, journalists, and the general public. It has been used to hold officials accountable and uncover harm, corruption, and political meddling in policymaking.
At HHS, FOIA requests are used to obtain a litany of records, including detailed CDC information about large outbreaks of food and waterborne illnesses, and FDA inspection reports of facilities that make food, drugs, medical devices, and dental products.
Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, said the FOIA cuts would have “an enormous effect on patient safety” and are “antithetical” to Kennedy’s promise to bring “radical transparency” to federal health agencies.
“It is simply not possible to honorably make that claim while decimating the staff,” Lurie said. “Can we rely particularly on this government to be forthcoming about the number of cases in an outbreak? You need FOIA to be able to take the lid off of that.”
HHS spokesperson Vianca Rodriguez Feliciano declined to respond on the record to questions about the department’s plans for processing FOIA requests from the CDC, FDA, and NIH.
Gunica Singh, staff attorney for the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, said the FOIA layoffs were almost certain to further slow the release of public records, which often took months or years before the cuts.
“What we need to be doing is the opposite of what’s happening now: hiring more staff,” she said.
Many records are disclosed only in response to FOIA requests. For example, during the covid-19 pandemic, FOIA requests forced the FDA to release internal documents showing little evidence to support using hydroxychloroquine to treat covid, even though President Donald Trump heavily promoted the drug.
Scientific researchers have used the law to obtain clinical trial data to assess whether drugs are safe and effective, or to get more details about adverse events associated with drugs and medical devices. Lurie said obtaining more information about adverse events is particularly important in serving as a bulwark against cherry-picking data or manipulating what’s available online to spread disinformation about the safety of vaccines and other products.
All these efforts will be slowed by the purge of FOIA offices, said Michael Morisy, CEO of MuckRock, a nonprofit group that helps journalists and others file public records requests. Scientists will have less to study. Attorneys and advocates will struggle to build cases and fight for causes. Simply, Americans will know less about their government and the industries it regulates and be less able to hold them both to account.
“I think one thing we’ve learned is that if there’s less watchdogging over an issue, that issue gets worse,” Morisy said. “I really do think that we are going to see companies become more lax with food safety, companies become more lax with consumer safety.”
Thousands of pending FOIA requests are likely to be affected.
During fiscal 2024 — from October 2023 through September 2024 — the CDC, FDA, and NIH received more than 15,000 FOIA requests and provided at least some records in response to more than 10,000, according to HHS’ most recent annual FOIA report.
Those requests were submitted by university researchers, state governments, laboratories, pharmaceutical companies, animal rights groups, law firms, and news organizations, including KFF Health News. Records sought by law firms appear related to investigations of illnesses, outbreaks, drugs, medical devices, and products used by countless Americans.
Morisy and Singh said filling requests is more complicated than many realize, often requiring an in-depth understanding of complex agencies. That’s why it’s important to house FOIA staff within each agency rather than consolidate them.
“We are sacking the entire staff and sacking all of that knowledge,” Morisy said. “And I just don’t see how these things continue to function.”

(Screenshot via Office of Economic & Demographic Research)Roughly two-thirds of Florida’s sales tax proceeds comes from households in the state, the latest analysis prepared by state economists shows, while tourists account for about 16% of the revenue collected.
The annual analysis was posted last week by Office of Economic and Demographic  Research and comes amid debate over whether to cut sales taxes c or look for ways to cut property taxes paid by homeowners. Florida levies a 6% sales tax on retail,  admissions, transient  lodgings, and commercial real estate rentals, unless expressly exempted.  A House legislative analysis shows that sales tax is projected to account for nearly 74% of the states general revenue in state fiscal year 2024-25.

Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to cut property taxes first and has cited the payment of sales taxes by “tourists” and “Canadians” as one justification. House Republicans, meanwhile, have touted their proposal to cut more than $5 billion in sales taxes as something that could take effect much sooner. House Speaker Danny Perez wants to trim back the sales tax from 6% to 5.25%.
EDR, which reports to the Legislature, estimates the source of sales tax revenue on an annual basis, but because state economists rely on data available from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics there is a lag, said Amy Baker, coordinator of the office.

The latest report, which is based on 2021-’22 information, calculates that households paid 65.8% of sales tax collections while businesses were responsible for slightly more than 18%. Tourists accounted for 16.1%.










Florida has a very regressive tax structure partly because we are so reliant on sales tax. For Floridians who make less they pay more of their income to taxation. … Any effort to address that imbalance is a positive one in my book.”


– Rep. Anna Eskamani 


These numbers have fluctuated somewhat, and previous reports show that tourists accounted for roughly 13% of sales tax collections in 2016 and 2017. The number of tourists has been on the upswing in recent years, according to Visit Florida, the state’s tourism marketing arm. EDR’s 2019-20 report estimated that more than 76% of sales taxes collected in that fiscal year came from households compared to 11.9% from tourists.
When discussing his own plan to lower property taxes, DeSantis argued that a cut in sales taxes would allow “relief for foreigners. It allows relief for visitors and part-time residents. I think that tax relief needs to be focused on Floridians.” 
The governor wants legislators to give an estimated 5.1 million residents who have a homestead exemption on their property taxes a rebate averaging $1,000 in December. That would be followed by a 2026 ballot proposal to enact a permanent tax cut.
The House, however, is moving ahead with its sales tax plan. The bill cleared its first committee unanimously on Wednesday with both Democrats and Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee praising the idea.
“Florida has a very regressive tax structure partly because we are so reliant on sales tax,” said Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat from Orlando. “For Floridians who make less they pay more of their income to taxation. … Any effort to address that imbalance is a positive one in my book.”

As NC Newsline has reported at length recently, Republicans in Congress are seeking to enact massive and unprecedented cuts to two of the nation’s core social safety net programs — Medicaid and SNAP food assistance. And while it’s not hard to show how such cuts will impact the people in need who depend on those programs, a new report from the Commonwealth Fund and The George Washington University School of Public Health points to another big and worrisome likely impact. It warns that the proposed cuts could trigger severe economic consequences — including the loss of a million jobs, a $113 billion decline in the gross domestic products of U.S. states, and $8.8 billion in lost state and local tax revenue in 2026 alone. And recently, to learn more, Newsline caught up with the report’s lead author, the Director of the Center for Health Policy Research at The George Washington University, Professor Leighton Ku.

(Provided by MSU for the Daily Montanan)The Montana Board of Regents announced Monday that Brock Tessman, former deputy commissioner in Montana and current president of Northern Michigan University, will serve as the next president of Montana State University in Bozeman.
Tessman has verbally accepted an offer and will take the reins on July 1, 2025, pending final negotiations and Board of Regents approval at its May meeting, according to a news release from the Office of the Commissioner of Higher Education.
Clayton Christian, Commissioner of Higher Education and chairperson of the Presidential Search Advisory Committee, said the committee saw “intense interest” in the position.
“I’m confident the process has yielded an outstanding, visionary leader in Dr. Tessman,” Christian said in a statement. “We believe Dr. Tessman is exceptionally well positioned to guide MSU to new heights.”

MSU is the largest university in Montana, with enrollment that topped 17,000 in fall 2024, a record. It also saw a record $257 million in research expenditures in 2024.
Tessman, who visited the campus last month along with one other finalist, will serve as MSU’s 13th president if confirmed.
He’ll lead the flagship in a time of significant challenge for higher education, with cultural pressure from the Trump administration. MSU faces its own difficulties, with previous opened investigations by the federal Office for Civil Rights for numerous discrimination allegations.
Details of the offer to Tessman were not immediately available Monday morning.
Current MSU President Waded Cruzado is a top paid public official in Montana, with an estimated $576,300 in salary and other compensation as of last August.
The search for a new president started in August 2024 when Cruzado announced her plans to retire after 15 years. A news release from the Commissioner’s Office said “her administration has left an indelible mark on the university and the MSU community.”
However, Regent Dean Folkvord and member of the Search Advisory Committee said he knew the charge was not to replace Cruzado but to identify a successor who would lead with passion and dedication.
“I think we succeeded, and I look forward to working with Dr. Tessman as he takes the reins,” Folkvord said in a statement.
The news release said Tessman’s accomplishments at Northern Michigan include steady enrollment growth at both undergraduate and graduate levels, record retention rates (78%), financial stability with top-tier bond ratings, unprecedented levels of private giving, and the completion of major capital projects.
“Dr. Tessman’s stewardship has fostered positive momentum across all aspects of university operations,” the news release said.
Tessman previously served as deputy commissioner for academic affairs in the Montana University System and dean of the Davidson Honors College at the University of Montana. He earned his bachelor’s degree in international relations from Brown University and both his master’s and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Colorado at Boulder.
The news release said Tessman is known for his energy, dedication to students, strong communication skills, and ability to deliver results — “qualities that make him uniquely suited to lead MSU into its next chapter.”
“Montana State University holds a special place in my heart given my previous work within the Montana University System,” Tessman said in a statement. “I am honored by this opportunity to serve as MSU’s next president and look forward to building on its incredible legacy.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/first-day-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 12:15:57.590961

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Courtesy Ivy Tech Community College)Indiana must retrain more than 82,000 working Hoosiers annually — with non-degree credentials — to meet workforce demand, Ivy Tech Community College has found.
And about 70% of job openings across four in-demand industries will require that additional training, according to the white paper, released Thursday. Non-degree credentials are industry-recognized certifications, certificates, licenses and other short-term training programs.
Ivy Tech is the nation’s largest single-accredited statewide community college system. Its analysis was conducted in collaboration with TEConomy Partners and funded by the Lilly Endowment.

“As Indiana’s workforce engine, Ivy Tech is committed to providing the high-quality, industry-aligned education and training that our state and employers need to drive economic growth and prosperity,” President Sue Ellspermann said in a news release.
 “This research underscores the urgent need to help Hoosiers acquire new or specialized skills as technologies such as automation and artificial intelligence continue to transform our workforce and economy,” she added.
Indiana, like the rest of the country, faces a workforce crisis, per the report. The state’s industry productivity is “too low,” there aren’t enough skilled workers to staff growing industries and the working-age population is shrinking.
“Indiana needs to improve productivity with the workforce it already has,” the report continues. “Employers can no longer rely on a passive approach, waiting for talent to arrive fully skilled.”
It estimated demand in four industry sectors key to Indiana’s economy:

Advanced Manufacturing: An estimated 18,300 annual positions will require credentials, including roles such as technicians, machinists, maintenance roles, and programmers.
Transportation and Logistics: Demand for 24,000 positions annually, including truck drivers, mechanics, and technicians, with a growing need for workers skilled in digital logistics and supply chain technologies.
Health care: Approximately 38,700 annual openings will require credentials, with high demand for nurses, medical assistants, and healthcare technicians.
Information Technology: Demand for 1,300 tech professionals, including software developers, systems analysts, and cybersecurity specialists, in sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, and logistics. The report notes forecasting may be limited by employment system data and rapid industry changes.

“Workforce is the economic driver,” Indiana Secretary of Commerce David Adams said in the news release. “Our ability to develop, recruit and retain talent here in Indiana is critically important, and that’s why Gov. (Mike) Braun and I are so focused on supporting the upskilling and reskilling of our incumbent Hoosier workforce. These research findings underscore the fundamental paradigm shift employers are going to have to wrap their arms around as they continue building a workforce that will strengthen the Hoosier economy.” 
In the report, Ivy Tech said it’s positioned as the “leading partner” to provide the skills training required to meet the demand. Currently, it enrolls more than 25,000 people annually in skills training and other workforce development programs — about 15% of its total enrollment.
Ivy Tech leadership will prioritize skills training delivery and scaling up related program offerings — but “cannot do this alone,” per the report.
“A collective state effort is required,” it says.
Employers should provide tuition and funding support, give data and feedback to training providers and tell their employees about training opportunities.
State government, industry associations, and economic or workforce development groups should promote training program funding and policies; enable data infrastructure and reporting capabilities; and convene others to boost partnerships, develop common curricula and more.
Postsecondary institutions — along with career, technical and vocational providers — should invest in course offerings, inform skills trainees about enrollment in occupational pathways, raise awareness that completed coursework can convert to credits for academic programs of study, and so on.

April 6, 2025. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Liam Niemeyer)Kentucky is bracing for a “problematic” night with freezing temperatures on the way to complicate standing water and wet conditions following a four-day flooding event, Gov. Andy Beshear said Monday. 
Areas that have flooded over the last four days — areas around Frankfort, Louisville and Paducah — are forecast to hit 32 degrees and below overnight Monday, according to the National Weather Service. 
“This is going to be a dangerous night where temperatures fall, where it gets potentially below freezing,” Beshear said during a Monday press conference alongside Lt. Gov. Jacqueline Coleman, Kentucky Emergency Management officials and Frankfort and Franklin County representatives. 
“So, if you’re somewhere that’s very wet, if you’re trying to ride this out in a home that’s had water, tonight could raise concerns of hypothermia,” Beshear said.   
This forecast comes while the Ohio River at Louisville is at 64 feet — double its normal depth — and flood walls closed Friday in preparation. The Ohio River at Paducah is 45 feet, higher than it was even during the February floods. 
The Kentucky River at Frankfort is also flooded at nearly 49 feet, much higher than its normal depths of under 20 feet, according to the United States Geological Survey. 
“It looks like the water level is not going to get as high here in Frankfort as previously thought,” Beshear said. “Right now, it looks like the levees are holding and it looks like the water is receding faster than originally thought.” 
Still, emergency officials have asked Frankfort residents to continue conserving water while the city works to bounce back. 
“The lieutenant governor and I live here. We both live in Frankfort. We’re both conserving water, like we’re asking everybody else to do right now,” Beshear said. “This is very personal to us, and we’re going to make sure that everybody in this city, as well as others that have been impacted, can get back up on their feet, and that we can move forward.”
Frankfort is also under a dusk-to-dawn curfew Monday night.

By the numbers 
As of Monday morning, state officials reported:

Two people have died in the flooding. 
One person is missing in McCracken County. 
1,788 are without power. 
2,847 are under a boiled water advisory. 
538 state roadways are closed. This does not include local road closures. 
52 shelters are open. Across the state, 45 households are sheltering in state parks, 10 are in hotels and 79 are staying in temporary housing units. 
354 Kentucky National Guard members are mobilized to help with storm response.

DeFoor delivers remarks Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025, at The Forum Auditorium in Harrisburg, Pa., after being sworn in for his second term as Pennsylvania’s auditor general. (Commonwealth Media Services)A pair of statewide elected officials stayed on message about their responsibilities in an increasingly political environment, during speeches at an annual gathering of conservative activists.
Both Pennsylvania Auditor General Tim DeFoor and state Attorney General Dave Sunday focused their talks on serving the people of Pennsylvania.
“I have an obligation to do the job the way it’s supposed to be done, an auditor general who draws conclusions based on facts, by bringing up and improving government, not tearing it down,” said DeFoor. 
“If our communities aren’t safe, literally nothing else matters. And the way that we keep our communities safe is by this crazy idea called enforcing the law,” said Sunday. “This seems simple. It seems obvious, but as we see it, too many of our major cities, it’s anything but that, for me, following the facts and the law are my guiding principles.”
DeFoor and Sunday both delivered 10-plus minute addresses in Camp Hill, Cumberland County, on Friday at the Pennsylvania Leadership Conference. 
DeFoor and Sunday, both Republicans, are coming off victories in November.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
For DeFoor, he earned a second term to lead the office tasked with working as the state’s fiscal watchdog. He defeated Democratic state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta.
“My first term was about building a foundation, one rooted in transformation, accountability, continued improvement and service to the community,” DeFoor said. “Our top description is clear, and that is to make sure state government funded programs are working, and that government is transparent with what it does with our state tax dollars.”
DeFoor touted the number of audits his office has conducted since being sworn-in and emphasized his push for financial literacy to be taught in Pennsylvania’s schools as early as kindergarten. His comments about state Sen. Chris Gebhard’s (R-Lebanon) legislation that will require public schools to teach a financial literacy course for high school students starting in 2026-2027 earned applause from the audience.
Sunday, who previously held the post of York County District Attorney, defeated former state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale, a Democrat, in the open race to lead the state Attorney General’s Office.
“So with regard to my approach to being a prosecutor, to start with, it’s summarized in two words, and many of you have heard this. It’s accountability and redemption,” Sunday said.

“One of the things that I believe gets lost when we talk about prosecutors is how essential consistency is,” Sunday said. “The laws of our country and our Commonwealth don’t change when one prosecutor takes over for another. There isn’t a Republican version of the law and then a Democrat version of the law.”
Sunday said there are “risks” for those who aim to return to a “more sane way of governing.” Even though he was just sworn-in to office in January, he said he’s already been required to make decisions that will result in him not always being “the most popular guy in the room.”
“I can safely say that in my first two months as Attorney General, I’ve made decisions that have driven people crazy from the entire political spectrum, and that’s what happens when you do this magical thing called following the law,” Sunday said. “The laws are the laws, though, and I will be consistent in following them that may, at times, put me in a position that means I’m following a law that I may not like, or a law that I disagree with, or a law that I may very much agree with, or a law that I’m indifferent about.”
When speaking to reporters following his speech, he said he’d “rather pass” when asked about the specific responses he’s heard from both sides of the aisle on decisions he’s made.
“I think in this role that I have right now as the attorney general, that I must be as apolitical as humanly possible,” Sunday said.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)The day police said Darren Boykins killed somebody, his mother told everyone they were wrong.
Carmella Bowers graduated from Rutgers University in Newark that day in 1981, about 25 years after she dropped out of high school. She said Darren was there, applauding at her commencement ceremony — not, as police claimed, murdering a carpet salesman a mile away.
While four other witnesses backed up that alibi at Boykins’ trial, jurors convicted him, largely on the word of a prisoner who testified Boykins had confessed the crime. No one mentioned at the trial that the jailhouse informant had reason to rat out Boykins; after the informant testified, prosecutors dropped charges against him for an unrelated murder and the sexual assaults of two toddlers.
“When we was in the courtroom after the trial was over and they found my son guilty, I couldn’t believe it. I fell out,” said Bowers, now 85. “I just couldn’t understand why he was guilty because I knew where he was that day.”
Now, Bowers has a powerful ally on her side: a retired attorney who spent seven months investigating Boykins’ case and has launched a crusade to exonerate him.
Attorney John Crayton said Boykins’ case has all the hallmarks of a wrongful conviction: authorities rushing an arrest in response to public panic over rising crime, detectives intent on locking away a trouble-making teen despite flimsy evidence, authorities hiding exculpatory facts from jurors, and a witness secretly incentivized to testify in exchange for leniency.
“The wrongfully convicted are victims of institutional failures and the callous indifference, and sometimes corruption, of those in authority positions. I strongly believe that a caring society should admit what can result from this combination,” Crayton told the New Jersey Monitor.
New Jersey lags behind other states in securing justice for people who have been wrongfully convicted. Lesley C. and D. Michael Risinger, a couple who head the Last Resort Exoneration Project at Seton Hall University School of Law, laid out New Jersey’s problems with ensuring conviction integrity in a study published this year.
“Prosecutors resist claims based on fresh exculpatory evidence with all the zeal of Spartan warriors defending the pass at Thermopylae. Judges, made weary by repeated applications for relief, find refuge in notions of finality and the sanctity of the jury verdict,” they wrote.
“Our study of New Jersey cases shows that unjustifiable obstacles to relief for the innocent cast a shadow over our criminal justice system,” they added.
Despite the obstacles, Crayton remains undeterred. He filed a clemency petition with the state on Boykins’ behalf, asked the state attorney general’s conviction review unit to consider the case, and sent an inch-thick report on his findings to the state public defender’s office, the Essex County Prosecutor’s Office, the New Jersey Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, state and federal lawmakers, and various other authorities he hopes will champion his cause.
None have committed to do so.

 A tough childhood in Brick City

Boykins came of age during a turbulent time in Newark’s history. He was a kid when race riots rocked the city in 1967, leaving years of rising crime, white flight, poor police-community relations, and high unemployment and school dropout rates in their wake.
By 1981, when two robbers gunned down Milton Laufer, 71, at the carpet company he ran with his brother on Shipman Street, Boykins was 19 and had already been in cops’ crosshairs for years.
“The police didn’t like him, because he hung around with the bad group, you know, they was always getting into trouble,” said his older brother, Johnnie Boykins. “We grew up in the projects, so everybody was on the cops’ radar.”
His neighborhood clashes also drew unwanted police attention to Boykins, who goes by the nicknames “Scoopie” and “Scoobie,” his mother said.
“Scoopie could fight, and he wasn’t scared of nobody,” Bowers said. “He would protect himself.”
Years of court records compiled by Crayton lay out what happened before and after Boykins’ conviction.
The year of Laufer’s murder, Newark had its most homicides ever, 161, a record that still stands today.
An Essex County homicide investigator charged Boykins in a prior slaying that year, but Boykins denied involvement, saying he was at work when the murder occurred. Bowers went to the detective — the same one who’d later arrest Boykins in Laufer’s death — and told him so.
“He told me, ‘I’m going to prove that he’s guilty.’ And I said, ‘Well, I’m going to prove he’s not!’” she said. “I wanted to fight him, really, because he made me so mad, because you could tell it was personal with him with my son.”
A judge dismissed the charges against Boykins, and several other men ultimately were convicted.










There’s a system failure. And it can’t be the only time this has happened.


– Attorney John Crayton


Laufer’s last day came on May 22, 1981. Two robbers entered his carpet company office and one shot him in the stomach. He died hours later.
On June 28, 1981 — with no one yet arrested in Laufer’s killing — police picked Boykins up for an unrelated aggravated assault. 
He had a .22-caliber revolver on him, but investigators determined it wasn’t the murder weapon, Crayton said.
Four days later, police charged him with Laufer’s murder. Their evidence was scant, with a missing murder weapon, a fuzzy description of the robbers, and no forensic clues, Crayton found.
Investigators also had a lead pointing them in another direction. An anonymous tipster identified another teenager with a violent history — who fit the description of the robbers — as one of those involved, and a polygraph indicated he lied when denying any knowledge of the robbery or murder, according to testimony from a 1989 post-conviction relief hearing for Boykins.
But Milton Laufer’s brother Harry had identified Boykins out of a photo lineup as one of the robbers, and the prosecution proceeded. Boykins’ attorney was not told about the other teen who failed the polygraph.
Prosecutors bolstered their case with the jailhouse informant, Alvis Holt, who told jurors Boykins confessed to him that he’d killed Laufer.
After a four-day trial, jurors convicted Boykins. He was sentenced to life in prison and has repeatedly been denied parole since he became eligible for release in 2006.

 ‘He’s a liar!’

Boykins has raised multiple issues to allege he was wrongfully convicted.
He has claimed that detectives, while he was in custody for the unrelated assault, directed him to stand in front of a mirror a day before the photo lineup. Crayton suspects that unusual direction served to give Harry Laufer an improper early peek at Boykins so that he’d be sure to identify Boykins as the culprit during the lineup the next day. Harry Laufer died in 2005.
As for Holt’s testimony, jurors never learned he had been charged in the sexual assaults of his girlfriend’s daughters, ages 2 and 3, as well as the Aug. 10, 1981, murder of John McCall, a former Marine gunned down during a robbery outside Beth Israel Hospital. Prosecutors did not inform Boykins’ trial attorney of either Holt’s criminal troubles or his cooperation in the McCall case.
Disclosure obligations require prosecutors to disclose any information to defense attorneys that could taint the credibility of a witness — such as prosecutors’ cooperation deals with informants — to ensure defendants get a fair trial by allowing jurors to judge a witness’ credibility.
After Holt testified in Boykins’ trial, prosecutors dropped charges against Holt in the sexual assault case. Holt’s murder and robbery charges also were dismissed.
Bowers said she watched Holt’s testimony with growing fury.
“I said: ‘He’s a liar! He’s a liar!’” she said. “They told me they’d put me out if I don’t shut up. So I shut up after that because I didn’t want to make it bad for my son.”
At Boykins’ 1989 post-conviction relief hearing, Holt explained how he came to be a crucial witness in the case against Boykins, who he said he had never met until they landed on the same jail tier.
Authorities initially asked him to sign a statement implicating another man in McCall’s murder. When an Essex County homicide investigator learned Holt was housed with Boykins, Holt was asked to sign a statement implicating Boykins in Laufer’s murder, Holt testified during that 1989 hearing.
According to a transcript of the hearing, Holt testified that the detective referred to Boykins as “that bastard.”
“He said, ‘I want that bastard. That bastard got away from me, but he won’t get away from me again,’” Holt said then.
Boykins did not prevail in that hearing.
“He had a good lawyer. She put all kinds of people on the stand and proved that Alvis Holt was a liar. Alvis Holt took the stand and said he was a liar. She showed all these Brady violations, one after another after another,” Crayton said. “But the judge downplayed them in his opinion, and even more shocking was that two years later, the appellate court just rubber-stamped that opinion. So there’s a system failure. And it can’t be the only time this has happened.”
He added: “It takes courage to admit that kind of wrong, and I think that’s lacking.”
The Essex County Prosecutor’s Office didn’t respond to a request for comment.
 Changes made for fairer cases

In the decades since Boykins was convicted, New Jersey has implemented a series of changes to make criminal investigations and prosecutions fairer for defendants.
The state has added new restrictions on photo lineups, recognizing that eyewitness identifications often are wrong, especially when they’re cross-racial. Mistaken witness identifications factored into 27% of nearly 3,700 exonerations across the country since 1989, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
State officials have also changed the rules on jailhouse informants, who can be unreliable because they generally lack firsthand knowledge of a crime and have an incentive to lie.
The courts also strengthened prosecutors’ disclosure obligations on jailhouse informants under rules adopted in 2022, said Peter McAleer, a Judiciary spokesman. At the courts’ direction, the state Attorney General’s Office created an inventory of jailhouse informants in every county to track how many times they offer information or testify in cases, McAleer added. Jailhouse informants were involved in 15% of exonerations in murder cases, according to the National Registry of Exonerations.
The Attorney General’s Office also reminded prosecutors of their disclosure obligations in a directive issued in 2019, the same year it created a conviction review unit.
Meanwhile, Murphy formed a clemency advisory board last year to recommend worthy candidates for clemency.
But exoneration work can be challenging.
“Procedural rules and time bars are routinely invoked to defeat the post-trial claims of persons with compelling evidence of actual innocence,” the Risingers of Seton Hall wrote in their study. “Strong evidence of actual innocence is brushed aside and given no worth by our courts. Post-conviction discovery is highly restricted.”
Because many of the challenges in getting exonerated stem from court hurdles, they added, “the work of reviewing cases for innocence and other fundamental injustice should not be simply offloaded by our judiciary onto a conviction review unit.”
McAleer said New Jersey trial courts received 356 post-conviction relief petitions last year, and time-related restrictions keep courts from being besieged by such filings.
“The court system cannot reasonably function without time limits on cases, but relevant court rules allow for relaxing limitations that ‘would result in an injustice,'” he said.
Even so, New Jersey has a dismal record on exonerations.
Six years since its inception, the attorney general’s conviction review unit has just two victories despite accepting 618 eligible cases to review. (Cases that remain on direct appeal or weren’t felonies in state court are ineligible.)
And Murphy, now in his eighth year in office, didn’t exercise his clemency powers until December when he pardoned 33 people and commuted the sentences of three more. More than 3,000 people have applied for clemency consideration, said Tyler Jones, a Murphy spokeswoman. His office is expected to announce more clemency actions this week.
Several groups outside government do exoneration work too, including the Risinger project, Princeton-based Centurion Ministries, the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, and the New Jersey Innocence Project at Rutgers University.
Still, New Jersey averaged just 1.6 exonerations a year between 2014 and 2023, according to the National Registry of Exonerations. Illinois, the national leader, had an annual average of 34.6 over the same decade. Illinois, with 12 million residents, is larger than New Jersey, but Michigan, which is more comparable in size to the Garden State, averaged 9.7 exonerations a year, according to the registry.
The work is time-consuming because it requires a full reinvestigation of a case, using both new technology and traditional investigative methods, said Attorney General’s Office spokesman Dan Prochilo. The unit’s standard for exoneration is clear and convincing evidence of actual innocence, he added.
“These investigations take substantial resources and time, as cases and evidence are often decades old,” he said.
Estimates of how many people in prison were wrongfully convicted range from 1 to 10%. Using those metrics, at least 130 people of the nearly 13,000 people now in state prisons may have been wrongfully convicted.

 A chance at life

Boykins, now 63, has been behind bars for 44 years.
Crayton has worked as a prosecutor, defense attorney, and investigator, and he knows politics plays a part in who succeeds in their exoneration bids.
Boykins is not the kind of would-be exoneree who politicians will trot out for photo ops and press conferences. He’s in poor physical and mental health, with diagnoses of schizophrenia and antisocial personality disorder, and last year suffered a brutal beatdown at the hands of his cellmate, Crayton said. If the effort to exonerate Boykins succeeds, he’ll likely need to remain in a psychiatric care home or similar setting, he added.
“There’s no happy ending for Darren Boykins, none, period,” he said. “The happy ending for him, maybe, is that he gets to see his mother once in a while, wherever he is, and he’s safer there than staying in prison.”
He still deserves a shot at freedom, he added.
“I don’t think anybody should ignore what happened to Darren,” he said. “Healthy societies need to acknowledge their wrongs.”
Boykins’ mother and brother still visit him in Trenton, where he’s incarcerated at the New Jersey State Prison, as often as they can.
“He’s real quiet, like this, like he’s sleeping,” Bowers said, slouching and slitting her eyes. “He told me they give him medicine. You could look at him and tell they keep him drugged.”
Bowers, a retired special education teacher, mourns all that her son lost out on in life.
“If I was in there for something I didn’t do, I don’t think I could have made it this long. I probably would have been dead,” she said. “I think God is just keeping him alive so he can have a chance, a little bit of a chance, at life. I pray to Allah every night to let my son come home before I die.”

(Max McCoy/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Reagan Herrman’s heart condition remained hidden until halfway through a summer youth basketball game at Washburn University when she became short of breath and struggled to reach the team’s bench.
“I went behind the bench, because my coach was also my dad. He told me to go walk, to walk it off. So I did and sat on the bench. Just as soon as I sat down, as I remember it, it all went black,” she said.
Herrman collapsed and went into cardiac arrest. Health professionals and others trained in CPR jumped into action. Eventually, a portable medical device known as an AED, or automated external defibrillator, was deployed. It delivered a single electric shock that restored her heartbeat.
“If the shock wasn’t delivered, I don’t think I would have made it,” she said on the Kansas Reflector podcast. “I remember waking up, being out of breath, breathing really heavy and then seeing people all around me. I heard voices and shouting and see people talking to me. Like ‘Reagan, can you hear me?’ Then I saw my mom, which she says I said, ‘I love you.’ ”


Herrman’s heart stopped for approximately four minutes on a Topeka basketball court on July 16, 2023. She was unresponsive and began to turn blue. The university’s preparation for health emergencies and the availability of a defibrillator saved the life of the then-13 year old Emporia resident.
She was airlifted to a hospital and spent a week in a cardiac intensive care unit. Doctors diagnosed Herrman with CPVT, or catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which is an inherited condition causing sudden heart rhythm disturbances in otherwise healthy children. She recovered and, eventually, was cleared to resume sports activities.
But Herrman’s story didn’t end there.
 
Politics of AEDs
The young cardiac-arrest survivor served as motivation for the Kansas Legislature to pass a 2024 law requiring public schools to develop cardiac emergency response plans that included CPR and AED training of key personnel. It was modeled after the Emporia school district’s decision in wake of Herrman’s experience to add 14 new AEDs to district buildings, provide training for school personnel and coaches, and install 120 signs to point people to lifesaving equipment.
“It is our hope that Reagan’s story can serve as a catalyst for change in Kansas’ approach to AED accessibility,” her mother, Amanda Herrman, told House and Senate lawmakers. “Reagan’s experience underscores the critical importance of this initiative. Our family feels blessed for the fortunate outcome that day, knowing that many other families may not have such a story to tell.”
That bill was supported by other Kansans with firsthand knowledge of cardiac arrest. The legislation required public schools to create cardiac emergency response plans and work to outfit buildings with AEDs. The bill received broad support in the House and Senate.
Reagan Herrman, who didn’t know CPR before enduring her own cardiac emergency, was in the Capitol for signing of the bill.
During the 2025 legislative session, the American Heart Association worked to convince the Legislature to appropriate $1.5 million to pay for CPR and AED training programs and the equipment purchases. That funding was included in a large budget bill awaiting action by Gov. Laura Kelly.
Kari Rinker, who works as a lobbyist for the American Heart Association, was involved in rallying support for additional funding to help Kansas public schools comply with the emergency training standard.
“There have been challenges in some communities getting this in place. Especially rural communities might have fewer training resources,” Rinker said.
Access to additional training and positioning of equipment in schools could reduce the hesitancy some people have about jumping into an emergency, she said.
 
‘Dream coming true’
Rinker said the survival rate of people who experienced cardiac arrest was around 10% without an immediate response from people on the scene. If CPR was performed quickly, she said, the survival rate could be doubled or tripled. When a child goes into cardiac arrest in a school with AEDs onsite, however, approximately 70% survive.
“Yet, fewer than 50% of people say they are confident to step in and perform this function. We want to improve that. We want to create a nation of lifesavers,” she said.
The $1.5 million in Senate Bill 125 was significant because a separate grant opportunity for schools to acquire AED equipment or training was eliminated due to a technicality.
Reagan Herrman said, if given a chance, she would urge the governor to support emergency medical funding for Kansas schools.
“I think this is just icing on the cake to finish what we started,” she said. “I’d say, honestly, it is a dream coming true.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Reagan-Hermann-April-2025-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-04-07 12:15:57.590961

Advocates and journalists are sounding the alarm daily, but joining the conversation can feel like a challenge when everything is moving at such a fast pace. It’s like attempting to double-dutch when the jump ropes are swinging too quickly — it’s hard to know when or how to jump in without tripping.
That’s why we at the Michigan League for Public Policy have followed the data and research so we can help folks make the right decisions. With what’s at stake, being informed is vital.
Medicaid is in serious jeopardy.
Right now, Republicans at the federal level are considering drastic cuts to Medicaid, the program that provides essential healthcare coverage to more than 2.5 million Michiganders in every part of the state who would otherwise be unable to afford needed medical care. The proposed cuts are part of a broader budget plan that aims to slash at least $880 billion from Medicaid to fund an extension of 2017-era tax cuts that mainly benefit the wealthiest Americans.
This is a big deal. Medicaid covers essential services like preventative screenings, mental health treatment, and long-term services and supports. If Congress is successful in passing their proposed spending cuts, thousands of children, families, seniors, and people with disabilities in Michigan could lose access to life-saving healthcare. Those cuts would also strain local economies by threatening jobs in health systems, hospitals and nursing facilities across Michigan that are vital to our communities. It truly is hard to overstate how deeply these cuts would affect our state.
Reductions in Medicaid funding would likely lead to:

Coverage losses: Millions of people could lose their health insurance, making it even harder to access necessary medical care.
Higher costs: Those who are unable to stay on Medicaid would face higher out-of-pocket costs for services and medications, putting more financial strain on already struggling families.
Hospital closures: Rural hospitals, which often depend on Medicaid funding to stay afloat, would be at increased risk of closing. For many rural areas, this would mean the closest hospital would be hours away, making emergency care, maternity care and other essential healthcare services much more difficult to access when they are needed. In Michigan, nearly 16% of seniors and more than 37% of children living in a small town have health coverage through Medicaid.

Many of your neighbors rely on Medicaid for their health insurance—check out our fact sheets to see how many people in your Congressional district are covered. This coverage means access to affordable, often lifesaving care. The more we understand and see the people behind the numbers, the more clearly we can defend a program that helps Michigan families stay healthy, stable, and able to thrive.

Easley decided to shut down her store in downtown Oak Grove after more than eight years on South Broadway. She relocated her business to a different vintage store in Blue Springs.
“Such a blessing to be in downtown Oak Grove for the last eight and a half years,” Easley told her Facebook followers. “I have truly enjoyed getting to know each and every one of you, hearing a little bit about your life and your story, and I will miss that the most out of everything that has happened in the last eight years. I will miss all of you.”
“Closing” was written in large letters above the shop’s door in late February, after Easley made the call to move the store. She said a lack of foot traffic made it difficult to reach profit margins in her store, which stocked home goods, jewelry and more.
While the store is in the center of the town of nearly 10,000 and sits on the town’s main thoroughfare, it also happens to be along a state highway. Route F, known as South Broadway through town, connects U.S. 50 to Interstate 70 and is a popular route for tractor-trailers as they traverse the area.
The Missouri Department of Transportation has authority over the highway and made the call to expand it to mostly five lanes in 2011. Through the downtown district, the highway shrinks to three lanes as drivers pass by a handful of retail spaces, insurance offices, hair salons and other service businesses.
“There’s just not a lot of foot traffic,” Easley told The Beacon. “That is one issue with having this be such a thoroughfare.”
“It makes me sad,” she said. “I know there’s just not a lot of shopping down here and out this way. But then it makes it too easy to shop on Amazon.”
Easley was a member of Oak Grove’s Chamber of Commerce and part of a group of small-business owners who wanted to start up a downtown revitalization project.
The group worked on staging events to encourage people to shop downtown. Ultimately, without lots of community buy-in, they struggled to get the effort off the ground.
“We were like, ‘You know what, we own these businesses down here. This should not be our responsibility,’” she said.
 Oak Grove’s dilemma 

The shop owners weren’t alone in their aspirations for downtown.
Oak Grove Mayor Dana Webb has been looking for ways to make it more welcoming to pedestrians since she was elected in 2020.
“I think we got the expansion several years too early,” Webb said of the project, which she wishes had more beautification measures built-in during the time of construction. “I don’t think our town was big enough at that time for it.”
Oak Grove advocates had previously explored joining Missouri Main Street Connection, a nonprofit that provides resources to towns across Missouri that want to launch revitalization efforts. But they ran into the same problem back then: a lack of community buy-in.
A few years later, the group of business owners approached Webb to see if their efforts overlapped with the city’s priorities. But between complicated building leases and the highway, the group ran into roadblock after roadblock.
“Businesses need eyes,” said Kennedy Smith, the former director of National Trust for Historic Preservation’s National Main Street Center and a current researcher at the Institute for Local Self-Reliance. “They need traffic and visibility, so if cars are going through downtown at 40 miles per hour, people aren’t going to see anything.”
The speed limit drops as cars travel through the heart of Oak Grove. Slower traffic can reduce some crash risk and improve pedestrian safety.
“There’s just so many what-ifs,” Webb said. “I hope someday that they have engineers, a team or a board, somebody that starts to look a little bit ahead for pedestrians.… If you go to other states or other countries, you see people walking. We don’t see people walking here. If you do, it’s odd.”
According to the U.S. Department of Transportation, a pedestrian hit by a vehicle traveling 32 miles per hour has a 25% risk of death. That risk increases to 50% when the vehicle is going 42 miles per hour. The World Health Organization recommends that the maximum road travel speed should be about 20 miles per hour in areas where bicyclists and pedestrians share the space.
“The key thing is that the interests of transportation engineers and people who are interested in healthy, vibrant downtowns are not necessarily the same thing,” Smith said.
Beautification projects, like adding trees, flowers or benches, were the first projects Webb brought to MODOT for its approval. She also wanted ways to make sidewalks feel more enclosed and less noisy for pedestrians, in an effort to limit perceived exposure to traffic and large trucks.
The city first asked if it could plant trees along the sidewalks throughout downtown. That plan was rejected due to driver safety considerations — if Oak Grove wanted trees, they had to be under 4 inches in diameter in case a car crashed into them.
Then, the city asked if it could put trees in large pots. That was also rejected for safety. They returned with other requests: shrubs, flowers or benches. They were all turned down.
“MODOT sometimes views a road going through a town as getting people from A to Z,” said Matthew Randall, the city administrator in Oak Grove. “When you live in the town, the road is your town. It’s integral to your city.”
They’ve had luck with some projects, while others haven’t gotten off the ground as quickly as they would like, Randall said.
“Just being downtown, the heavy commercial traffic and tractor-trailers definitely have a negative impact on the experience,” Randall said.
 How MODOT works with Missouri cities

MODOT’s area engineers are integral links between communities and the state. They help coordinate projects and maintain infrastructure across Missouri. Usually, they are the ones who make the requests to MODOT on behalf of cities for the projects they want to pursue.
“There’s a number of places where the state highway may function more as the main street of a community,” said Eric Schroeter, the deputy director and chief engineer at MODOT. “We have to balance all of that out – not only is it somebody’s main street, but it’s also a link in a transportation system that has to help people get places, and goods and products move around as well.”
MODOT is in charge of the seventh-largest highway system in the country, but ranks 48th nationally in funding per mile. MODOT only pays for projects that relate specifically to their domain. Everything else falls to the cities.
Officials in Oak Grove and other Missouri towns are thankful for MODOT’s collaboration and the easy access they have to their area representatives. Lebanon, Missouri, launched its downtown revitalization project officially in 2019. The town’s main street intersects with state Route 5.
“The highway intersection, it can be a little dicey,” said Sarah Angst Stewart, the executive director of Downtown Lebanon. “It’s not dangerous, it’s just a little more challenging for a person who is not used to walking near semi trucks blowing by.”
Lebanon has been working with MODOT over the past decade to improve walkability throughout downtown. The public works department meets with the state on a monthly basis to talk about future projects and address concerns as they arise.
“There are challenges involved with having a highway where there are pedestrians,” Angst Stewart said. “MODOT has put an effort into making sure that it is more pedestrian friendly.”
Since putting a concerted effort into downtown revitalization plans, the mix of businesses in downtown Lebanon has started to shift.
“This is probably every rural downtown. It’s the cheapest rent because it’s a lot of stuff packed close together, in older buildings that haven’t had a lot of love and attention,” she said.
But the exact opposite has started to happen in Lebanon. What was once a downtown that was heavily saturated with insurance companies, accountants and attorneys is now home to new retail and dining.
“It’s really cool to see. I don’t know if it’s finally the right time,” Angst Stewart said. “What’s happening is this resurgence of small-town downtowns. Where do you find that real community? It’s downtown.”
In the four years that Lebanon has invested in having a director for the downtown district, the area has doubled its taxable sales from $5 million in 2019 to $10 million in 2023.
“By just focusing on it, that is a lot of tax revenue that can then go back to our local economy and fund things like our police, fire and capital improvements,” she said.
Up north in Chillicothe, the town has reaped the benefits of long-term planning and making a name for its history. The city is the home of sliced bread, which was invented there in 1928. U.S. 65 runs north-south through Missouri and is Chillicothe’s main street.
“Highway 65, or Washington Street, is the heart of that artery that fuels our town,” said Amy Supple, Chillicothe’s tourism director. “(People) get to travel right through the heart of our community, so they’re not bypassed. It’s not an exit sign that they see.”
In the early 2000s, business owners, the tourism organization and the main street organization put their heads together to find ways to diversify downtown. What resulted was a 30-year strategic plan, and the organization set short-term priorities to reach long-term goals.
A long-term plan is crucial for investment in infrastructure, said Chris Hess, the executive director of the Pioneer Trails Regional Planning Commission, which coordinates efforts across Johnson, Lafayette, Pettis and Saline counties in Missouri.
“Funding follows planning,” Hess said. “The knee-jerk reaction for funding does not end well very often. We’re thinking about what can drive the economics. Do we see a population boom coming up? Is there potential for expansion in this area?”
That’s part of what Oak Grove is trying to assess. The city’s population is growing. In 2010, the town had about 5,000 residents, according to the census. Today, the town is pushing toward a population of 10,000.
For now, Oak Grove has negotiated with MODOT that the city will take control of the parking spaces that line the downtown district. And they’ll keep trying to work with the state to make the area more inviting to potential visitors, despite its popularity for commercial truck drivers.
“We haven’t really talked to them in detail about that aspect of the pedestrian versus the car versus the connectivity,” Webb said. “Because we’re pretty much just stopped at the driver effect.”

(Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

Photo by Nicole Neri for the Minnesota Reformer. Senate President Bobby Joe Champion said he would pursue an advisory opinion from the Senate Ethics Subcommittee regarding a potential conflict-of-interest raised by recent Reformer reporting, which showed that he’d done legal work for the Rev. Jerry McAfee while also advocating for McAfee’s nonprofit 21 Days of Peace to receive millions in state grants.
“I understand that questions have been raised about a potential conflict of interest regarding my work as a senator and a private practice attorney. Out of an abundance of caution, I have asked the Senate Ethics Subcommittee for an advisory opinion,” Champion, a Minneapolis Democrat, said Monday.
Under Senate rules, a member of the Senate may request advice from the Senate Ethics Subcommittee on a potential conflict of interest.
Complicating the situation: Champion is chair of the ethics subcommittee. He said he’s asked to be temporarily replaced as chairman until the matter is resolved.
Last month, Champion introduced a bill (SF2978) providing a $1 million grant to 21 Days of Peace, a violence prevention group headed by McAfee.
Meanwhile, starting in 2022, Champion, in his private capacity as an attorney, represented McAfee and his nonprofit Salem Inc. in four court cases involving nonpayment of mortgages on multiple Minneapolis properties, totaling roughly half a million dollars.
That period overlaps with the 2023-24 legislative session, when lawmakers gave a $3 million grant to McAfee’s nonprofit. Champion was the chief author of that bill as well.
Champion says that his work on the mortgage cases was pro-bono, and that because it concluded in December 2022, prior to the start of the legislative session, he did not need to disclose the relationship to the public or to his colleagues.
“There would be no need to disclose a work relationship which had already concluded at that time, and which provides no financial benefit to me,” he said through a spokesperson.
McAfee, in an interview with the Reformer, refused to say whether he paid Champion for his legal services: “I won’t answer that,” he said. “Is there something on the books that would prevent me from hiring him as an attorney?”
Champion says he keeps records of his pro-bono clients, but declined to share the relevant portions.
Richard Painter, a University of Minnesota Law School professor who was the chief White House ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, said Champion’s actions represent a “clear” conflict of interest.
“Nobody should sponsor a bill in the Legislature favoring a client, pro-bono or not, it doesn’t matter,” he said. “It’s a basic principle that in a legislative body, if there is a bill that’s going to help your client, you say, ‘This is my client.’”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/NN230324_240-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-07 11:19:18.368768

As has been well-documented in recent weeks, the Trump administration is implementing a massive and chaotic bloodletting of the federal government. From the attempted elimination of the Department of Education to the evisceration of several other key departments — including the National Weather Service and the Department of Veterans Affairs — President Trump and Elon Musk have moved, without legislative authorization, to end or dramatically reduce funding for a host of programs and initiatives.
So how is this playing with North Carolina voters? According to new survey data released by the Elon University Poll, not so well. As NC Newsline learned in a recent special extended conversation with the poll’s director, Prof. Jason Husser, North Carolinians are skeptical of the cuts and deeply divided over the President’s mass immigrant deportation initiatives and his overall job performance.

(Photo by Jonny Armstrong, courtesy of Oregon State University.)Some already threatened cold-water fish species in the Northwest will not only face shrinking habitat from climate change but will face growing pressure from invasive fish species fleeing their own warming and dwindling waters, according to modeling from researchers at Oregon State University.
The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global Change Biology by fisheries professor Guillermo  Giannico, associate fisheries professor Ivan Arismendi and graduate student Arif Jan. The three found that climate change is likely to compel all kinds of species migration that could lead to increased predation, competition and some localized extinctions of once native species in the Northwest and globally.
Giannico said their models can be run on most species in the world. But for their recent study, the three zeroed in on the northern migration of non-native smallmouth bass and northern pike into threatened and endangered native redband and bull trout habitat in the Northwest. All four of the species are likely to lose habitat as climate change accelerates and are likely to seek homes in colder water at higher elevations.
They created maps using ecological data that indicate the breadth of territory where each species lives and then modeled the impact of changing conditions such as higher temperatures and drought projected through 2070 to see how that would influence the range of all four species’ movement and overlap.
“We forecast how these species would respond to those changing conditions by disappearing from certain regions that will be too warm for them, and appearing in others that maybe today are too cold, but they would be more suitable in the future,” Giannico said. “Because not all shifts are equal, there will be areas where they will be more crowded together, and they would overlap more, and areas where they wouldn’t overlap that much.”
Of great concern is the migration of aggressive and predatory northern pike into redband and bull trout territory, and the increasing likelihood the two will overlap more frequently.
“They all shift, but they end up shifting in a way that the amount of overlap in their distribution is going to be greater,” Giannico explained. “It’s like you have less room to avoid nasty people at the party, and you end up being cornered in the same part of the room with the same people you don’t enjoy, and you’re all packed in the wrong place with the wrong companion.”
Giannico said researchers have long separately studied how climate change will compel the migration of some species and how native species respond to the introduction of invasive species. The modeling done by the Oregon State scientists is an effort to combine the two, and to show how species’ habitats will overlap as climate change compels both native and nonnative species in an area to migrate and cohabitate.
The researchers fear that this increased negative interaction could lead to local extinctions of some native salmonids, similar to those occurring among shrinking populations of bull and rainbow trout from invasive species in southeastern Alaska, Giannico said.

“We are breaking away from the winter. It’s the reunification of families after a long winter. We celebrate it in our Spring Feast,” said John Ostrander, 63, Executive Director at Nokomis and member of the Ojibwe Nation.

Before the feast, those present gathered around the fire outside the Nokomis Center. The tobacco had been placed around the sacred fire, so everyone took a handful and offered it into the flames after a short prayer.
The youngest woman among the group brought a small portion of each food from the feast to offer to the spirits of the ancestors. The smoke rising into the sky carries those prayers and offerings to the elders who are no longer here, honoring that they are still present here with them. Then, everyone can go inside and eat.
From elders first to the youngest, everyone served themselves the food that they each brought, but before that, a prayer of gratitude was offered. Ariel Waagosh gave the prayer in Anishinaabemowin, the Great Lakes region language.

“All life is here and connected, and as human beings, we couldn’t live without breath, plants, water, and the sun. We are nourished by life. As gratitude, the prayer comes from our most humble place”, said Waagosh, 47, a member of the Grand Traverse Band of Ottawa and Chippewa Indians.

The attendees of this gathering emphasized the importance of staying united and continuing these traditional events that strengthen ties among their members.
“This is the only place in my life where I can have a community. These are scary times right now; nothing is certain, so we have to take joy from where we can get it”, said Julia Tehauno, 23, Comanche member.
“You could see, during lunch, how loud it was; it was because people were talking, relaxing, and having a good time. And within the Native community, that’s a good thing to have: a space where every Indigenous person is welcome,” said Ostrander.

Penningtion was fired from his job as an economic policy analyst at the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency for his criticism of Cargill on LinkedIn. Photo by Madison McVan/Minnesota Reformer.Environmentalists have long feared that Minnesota state regulators have been captured by local industry heavyweights — allowing big companies like Cargill and 3M to shape environmental policy in their own interests instead of the public’s. 
But no one would accuse Derric Pennington, a conservation scientist hired by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency last year, of being captured by industry, and by Cargill in particular. 
Pennington is active on social media, especially LinkedIn, where he shares his original hand-drawn editorial cartoons with captions critiquing the country’s biggest food and agriculture companies — and ineffective attempts by regulators to rein in pollution. He’s developed a following of nearly 7,500, many of them drawn to Pennington because companies’ marketing posts offer a ripe opportunity to question their sustainability claims.

From the perspective of Cargill, however, Pennington’s assertive posture with the Minnesota-based food industry giant — including direct messages to a Cargill employee — was “unprofessional.” When they alerted the MPCA, the agency acted. 
The case underscores the complexity of free speech issues for government agencies, said David Larson, a professor at Mitchell Hamline School of Law. Unlike private employers, public employers like MPCA are governed by the First Amendment. But the state can still fire employees when managers believe the employee’s speech “interferes with the agency’s interest in maintaining an efficient and effective workplace,” Larson said.
Before he was onboarded to the agency, Pennington told the hiring supervisor that he was an unpaid cartoonist and essayist on the side, and asked if he would be able to continue his activities outside of work while working for MPCA. 
“Its been a way for me to engage both my right and left brain when communicating my science and to publicly critique the many private and public policy solutions being proposed to chart society and business on a more sustainable course,” Pennington said.
The manager checked with Human Resources and confirmed with Pennington that he would be allowed to continue his activities, as long as there was “no conflict of interest with the business (i.e., financials) or mission (i.e.,ensuring that every Minnesotan has healthy air, sustainable lands, clean water, and a better climate) of the agency,” according to an email obtained by the Reformer.
In August, Pennington messaged a Cargill staffer on LinkedIn and asked some technical questions about the company’s oilseeds investments, and criticized its sustainability work.
The employee responded, offering a couple of times to talk on the phone rather than via direct message.
“Call me skeptical given my experience with Cargill’s sustainability team,” Pennington wrote at one point.
(Click the photo below to view the full exchange.)
  Private messages between Derric Pennington and a Cargill employee. The Reformer redacted the Cargill employee’s name.
Those messages made their way to Cargill higher-ups, and in August, Cargill government relations director Gary Kay emailed the head of MPCA’s climate division.
Kay wrote to the MPCA: “Our concerns lie with the accusations of green washing, and just the unprofessional nature of Mr. Pennington’s tone. Asking for future planned investments, market insights, and what we are paying producers are, in our opinion, wildly outside the scope of a state regulator.” 
Pennington said his direct messages to the Cargill employee were a personal interest and unrelated to his work at the agency.
  An email sent to MPCA’s climate director on August 22, 2024. The Reformer redacted the name of the Cargill staffer who messaged with Pennington.
One of Pennington’s supervisors sent him a memo, stating that by listing MPCA as his employer on LinkedIn, Pennington had given the impression that he was speaking on the agency’s behalf. 
“You are not authorized to represent MPCA’s views, and you must not engage in behavior that would adversely affect your work, job duties or ability to function in your position or create a hostile work environment,” the supervisor wrote, referencing the agency’s social media policy. 
Social media usage could become the basis for discipline in the future, the memo reads. 
“You should not post comments/posts/tweets/etc. that: 1)Impede the services provided by MPCA; 2)Disrupt MPCA’s workforce or operations; 3)Interfere with important working relationships; 4)Negatively impact the ability of MPCA to carry out its mission,” the memo continues.
Pennington removed MPCA from his LinkedIn profile and continued posting his cartoons and accompanying critiques of mainstream agriculture practices, carbon capture schemes and regulatory failures. 
He said he believed his posts were protected speech, and he wasn’t disclosing any information directly related to his employer or job duties — nor was he ever told not to engage with Cargill or its employees, he said. By removing MPCA from his profile, he said he believed he eliminated the perception that he was speaking on behalf of the agency.
“I didn’t think I did anything wrong,” Pennington said.
Then, in November, Pennington commented on one of Cargill’s LinkedIn posts promoting the company’s carbon market program, RegenConnect:
“Cargill what % does this 1 M acres represent relative to your total U.S. farm acres? Iowa alone had over 28 million acres planted in corn and soy last year.”
Pennington’s comment continued, questioning the details of the program.
Kay then emailed the MPCA chief of staff. 
“As I mentioned the first time, we view posts on this website from government employees as distinct from private citizens. Additionally, we take issue with the tone and the facts he put forward,” Kay wrote. 
Five days after the second complaint, Pennington was fired — just days before he reached his six month anniversary at the agency, when he would have joined the union and gained the right to a grievance process.
Pennington said his firing was a violation of his right to free expression, a misapplication of the agency’s social media policy and an example of corporate capture of Minnesota regulators. 
He said he believes his actions were in line with MPCA’s mission of “ensuring that every Minnesotan has healthy air, sustainable lands, clean water, and a better climate.”
Pennington’s case is nuanced, Larson said. The fact that the agency gave him a go-ahead to keep up his editorial cartooning works in Pennington’s favor, but the “okay” from the agency may not have extended to the private messages. And it’s unclear whether an employee’s duty not to interfere with the agency’s ability to “maintain an efficient and effective workplace” applies to the relationship between an agency and the companies it regulates. 
In Larson’s view, the direct messages could be perceived as investigatory. 
“I think there’s a distinction between posting an opinion and pursuing an investigation,” Larson said. 
Marshall Tanick, a Twin Cities employment and constitutional lawyer who has provided counsel to Pennington, said it’s a close case, but in his view, the termination was improper. 
“I think (MPCA) overstepped their boundaries, and I think they lack good cause to fire him under these peculiar circumstances,” Tanick said.
MPCA declined to comment, citing the confidentiality of personnel matters. Cargill did not respond to a request for comment. 
Pennington’s application for unemployment benefits was denied because he was fired for misconduct, so he appealed.
The appellate judge wrote that “Pennington’s continued posting of his opinions on social media in November 2024 was more akin to a good faith error in judgment or simple unsatisfactory conduct than the serious violation of standards required to find employment misconduct.”
The judge overturned the decision to deny Pennington benefits.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/P1230025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-04-07 10:05:53.067714

She pulled over, as did the officer trailing her. However, he didn’t switch off the lights on top of the car.
Moments later Rio, who was 9 or 10 at the time, started making loud noises, banging his head and even trying to escape the vehicle.

Rio struggles with nonverbal autism. Lights from cars and streetlights combined with the flashes of red and blue on top of the police cruiser to send him into sensory overload.
“Everything is so intensified,” said Luna, who still bears a scar on her wrist from the incident.
In 2000, an estimated 1 in every 150 children in the United States had autism. By 2020, prevalence had increased to every 1 in 36 children, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The South Carolina Autism Society estimates that more than 70,000 people in the state are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.
Yet, education on autism, as well as most other neurodivergent diagnoses, still lags.
Luna founded Just Bee, an organization that aims to make communities more autism friendly, in 2019, while still living in California. After her family was told to leave a pizza restaurant when Rio started to have sensory overload, Luna said she asked herself, “Why can’t people just be nice?”
She wondered if the situation would’ve gone differently if the employees understood that Rio was autistic and were trained on how to respond: “That was my call to action,” she said.
In 2021, Luna ditched Los Angeles for Mount Pleasant, leaving behind her previous career as a dancer and choreographer.
She met Gov. Henry McMaster later that year at a state Chamber of Commerce event. She shook his hand and said she was going to make South Carolina the first autism-friendly state.
It’s a moment she chuckles when reflecting on. But Luna was sincere.
In 2023, Just Bee launched an app Luna describes as “the Yelp of autism.”
Families can find sensory-friendly and welcoming spots on the app where employees have gone through autism training. They may offer discounts and sensory-friendly hours.
So far, most locations on the app — which include restaurants, gyms and even doctors’ offices — are in the Mount Pleasant area, though Luna hopes the desire to create a welcoming atmosphere will spread.
“It’s not about disability. It’s about possibility,” she told the SC Daily Gazette.
‘Rio’s law’
Her advocacy also led to the creation of a specialty license plate with the Just Bee emblem. It’s meant to alert officers before they approach the vehicle that someone inside is autistic or neurodivergent and could have a sensory reaction.
Luna first mentioned the idea of a specialty license plate to Carl Ritchie when he was a Mount Pleasant City councilman — a year before he was elected Charleston County sheriff.
He connected Luna with Rep. Kathy Landing, R-Mount Pleasant, who introduced legislation in January 2024 to create the Just Bee plates. Her proposal got wrapped into a broader bill creating multiple specialty plates, which the Legislature passed unanimously and McMaster signed last May.
“I’m very lucky I got that introduction,” Luna said.
According to the Autism Society, 20% of people with autism spectrum disorder will be stopped and questioned by police by the time they are 21, and 5% of them are arrested.
That’s because an untrained officer often misinterprets traits of the disorder — such as a lack of eye contact or little social awareness — as being suspicious or disrespectful, which can escalate a situation.
“A teenager (with autism) may encounter law enforcement and may not be doing anything wrong, but something doesn’t seem quite right to the officer,” Landing said. “Next thing you know, they’re in a situation where they’re questioning them; it scares them, and they start acting on you.”
She and Luna see “Rio’s law” as a step toward minimizing those situations.
The plate became available in February.
As of March 31, nine of those plates had been issued, said Mike Fitts, spokesman for the state Department of Motor Vehicles.
Luna’s confident that number will rise as more people know about it. Plus, she said, that’s nine vehicles that are safer than they were before.
“We never have a dry eye in the room when we tell parents their kids are going to be safer,” Luna said.
Officer training
This year, Luna is advocating for a bipartisan bill that would require all law enforcement officers to undergo training on autism spectrum disorder. Landing is the chief sponsor.
The House Judiciary Committee voted unanimously last week to advance the bill to the House floor.
It would help people with autism live a “full life,” Luna told legislators at a March 27 hearing.
“Without training, we cannot protect our loved ones like my son. We cannot protect our officers, our first responders,” she said.
The proposal would expand on the training officers undergo at the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy.
Currently, autism is discussed as part of mental health training. By requiring courses specifically on autism, the proposal would lead to a deeper understanding of autism and how to respond to people they encounter, said Jackie Swindler, the academy’s director.
Stephanie Turner, director of autism for the state’s department of disabilities, has been traveling around the state for more than two years conducting voluntary training related to autism at law enforcement agencies.
She said most officers she speaks with know someone with autism and want to learn more. Her lessons are part of a week-long program offered by the National Association of Mental Illness on a variety of topics.
After the license plate law was signed last year, she started telling officers about it as part of her training. Turner said Luna helped in creating a flyer on autism that Turner hands out to officers.
There’s “a lot of work that can be done with autism” in the state, she said.
“I think what Layla and Just Bee have done is remarkable,” Turner said. It “shows the power of a mom.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/processed-467D7C5D-3EC5-4682-979A-F67BBF7CBD29-e1744030803267-1024x783.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 10:05:53.067714

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)With more than half of Alaska’s regular legislative session over, attention in the state Capitol is focusing on a limited set of topics.
Before their scheduled adjournment in mid-May, leading legislators say they intend to pass a public school funding increase, enact one or more bills that would increase corporate taxes, and set the budget — including this year’s Permanent Fund dividend.
Late last week, all three priorities remained in a state of flux, and it wasn’t clear what form any will take by the time lawmakers leave Juneau.
Where’s the state budget?
Every year, the Legislature deals with multiple budget bills. 
First, there’s the supplemental budget, which addresses problems — unforeseen expenses and rises and falls in revenue — with the budget that lawmakers passed last year.
That budget deals with the current fiscal year, which ends June 30. Right now, there’s almost a $200 million deficit in the current fiscal year. The House has passed a bill to address that deficit, but it has not yet unlocked the Constitutional Budget Reserve — the state’s main savings account — to fill the deficit. 
The supplemental budget bill is scheduled for hearings in the Senate this week. That bill could advance through the Senate separately, or it could be combined with another budget bill. Regardless of what the Senate does, the House will still have to vote to unlock the CBR to balance the supplemental budget.
The Legislature may have to unlock the CBR for the upcoming fiscal year’s budget as well.
On Thursday night, the House Finance Committee approved a draft operating budget bill that would cover the fiscal year that starts July 1. 
That draft is expected to face a vote of the full House this week. As currently written, it would result in a deficit of $1.9 billion, and that would have to be covered with money from the CBR. 
As the House votes on the operating budget, the Senate is expected to vote this week on the capital budget, which pays for construction and renovation projects across the state.
As drafted, that bill contains only the minimum amount of state money needed to unlock federal grants. 
There’s also the state’s mental health budget bill, which is moving forward along with the operating budget but is generally uncontroversial because it is paid for with the state’s mental health trust fund and doesn’t affect the rest of the budget.
What’s the state of education funding?
Right now, the House’s draft operating budget includes a funding boost for K-12 public schools that’s worth more than $250 million. Without additional legislation, that’s only a one-time boost.
On Wednesday, the Senate Education Committee advanced House Bill 69, which would permanently boost per student funding by $1,000, to $6,960 per student, and incorporates a variety of education policy changes like open enrollment statewide and capping class sizes. 
The per-student increase would cost $253 million, plus an estimated $22 million for reading incentive programs, $706,000 for Mt. Edgecumbe High School, and over $158,000 for a new state charter school coordinator, totaling over $275 million. 
Sen. Löki Tobin, D-Anchorage and the education committee chair, said she was aiming to find common ground through the latest version of the bill.
The bill moved to the Senate Finance Committee on Friday, but has not been scheduled for a hearing yet. 
Gov. Mike Dunleavy took to social media on Thursday to criticize the education committee’s version of the bill, saying that it would “inequitable constraints” on students enrolled in correspondence programs. The bill would tie funding for these programs — which serve most of Alaska’s homeschool students — to students being assessed through a standardized test or portfolio. 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXDunleavy introduced education legislation in January through the House and Senate to provide one-time funding for schools, and added a range of policy changes, including an expansion of the correspondence programs that enroll most homeschool students in the state. The proposal would cost an estimated $181 million next year, including $75 million for the homeschool students as well as career and technical education, and $14 million for transportation. 
That measure, Senate Bill 62, is currently being heard in the Senate Education Committee, and its counterpart in the House, House Bill 76, is in the House Education Committee, with the next hearing scheduled for Friday, April 11.  
How will Alaska pay for it all?
In recent years, the Alaska Legislature has used the amount of the Permanent Fund dividend to balance the budget, raising the dividend in good years and lowering it in bad ones rather than follow the dividend formula in state law.
Because of low oil revenue and the desire for more public school funding, taking that approach this year would result in a dividend well below $1,000.
That idea is unpopular among legislators, who are instead considering alternatives. One is the CBR, but because it requires a supermajority in the House and the Senate, it’s procedurally difficult. As few as six senators or 11 House members could block the draw from savings.
Overspending from the Alaska Permanent Fund is possible with a simple majority vote of the House and Senate, but that would reduce the amount of money available from the fund in the future and create significant uncertainty that likely would harm the state’s debt rating.
Some legislators, particularly in the Senate, are proposing tax hikes to address the situation. In late March, the Senate Resources Committee advanced a bill that would change the way the state’s corporate income tax applies to the oil company Hilcorp. That’s expected to generate as much as $150 million per year.
That bill, Senate Bill 92, is scheduled for a hearing Wednesday in Senate Finance.
The Senate Resources Committee is also considering a broader change to oil taxes that involves reducing a tax credit awarded to companies at certain oil prices on each barrel of oil. That change is in Senate Bill 112, which was heard Friday by the resources committee but doesn’t have another hearing on the calendar.
Enacting that bill is expected to generate as much as $190 million for state services or the dividend in the coming fiscal year.
The Senate Finance Committee is also considering a change to taxes on internet sales, but that’s not considered a substantial change. 
The state House has yet to seriously consider any tax increases, and Gov. Mike Dunleavy has previously said that he strongly opposes any tax increases, which has hampered the drive to balance the budget by raising taxes.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.

The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Funding freezes and staff cuts pull the rug out from under farmers

Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.

Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Billions of dollars at stake for farmers hit by Trump funding freeze, pause on foreign aid

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

New Mexico’s biannual, 60-day lawmaking session ended after two breakneck final weeks with the Democratic-majority, volunteer legislators working right up to the noon deadline.
In the end, it was another legislative session that confirmed business as usual for the state’s oil and gas industry. Bills that would keep new wells away from schools; keep habitual rule violators and financially risky companies and people from buying wells; increase state fees and penalties to match the rate of inflation; and codify the state’s much-touted methane regulation rules, as well as a bill to reduce the state’s overall greenhouse gas emissions — all these and more were voted down or left undebated, preserving the industry status quo.
But that may not last. Over the same 60-day period, which ended March 22, the Trump administration fired up its scorched-earth policy to dismantle the federal government, including plans to deregulate the oil and gas industry, easing the status quo for oil and gas producers. And despite warnings since the November election and increasing clarity over the last two months, New Mexico’s legislators did not address the promised federal regulatory collapse in its just-finished session.
Hours after being sworn into his second presidential term, Donald Trump sat down and signed 26 executive orders that, taken together, unwind much of the climate-related regulatory work begun under his predecessor, President Joe Biden. Two of those orders, Declaring a National Energy Emergency and Unleashing American Energy, amount to a set of promises to deregulate fossil fuel production, and particularly in the oil and gas industry, promising an earthquake of federal regulatory change for New Mexico, the nation’s second-largest oil producer.
That was Jan. 20. The next day, the New Mexico Legislature began its biannual two-month session. (In even-numbered years there is a one-month session devoted solely to the budget.)
 











It's difficult to react to breaking changes coming out of Washington


– State Rep. Matthew McQueen, D-Galisteo



 
Then on March 12, 10 days before the end of the session, EPA Director Scott Zeldin announced the mechanisms to fulfil Trump’s promises: a massive series of EPA regulation rollbacks that would dramatically deregulate oil and gas production, the state’s most lucrative industry.
“We are driving a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion,” Zeldin said.
At the time, Rep. Matthew McQueen (D-Galisteo) said, ”Right now, we’re focused on what we have in front of us and what we can get across the finish line.” The short, two-month session kept state representatives and senators focused on immediate state matters, which took the form of 1,182 bills. Only 195 of those passed both chambers and went to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham for consideration and signature into law. Given the tidal wave of legislation and the session’s tight timeframe, McQueen said, “It’s difficult to react to breaking changes coming out of Washington,” dagger or no.
McQueen sponsored or co-sponsored five industry-related bills, though only one made it all the way through: a very specific royalty rate increase on new state leases in the most lucrative acreage of the Permian Basin, the nation’s most prolific and profitable oilfield. It is one of just two notable changes for oil and gas producers in the session. The second successful bill ties state penalties for pipeline safety violations to the federal penalty rate, doubling the state’s current level. A fiscal impact report estimated the change might bring the state, at most, another $125,000 a year, depending on the number of violations. The report also warned that under this arrangement the state penalty would be jeopardised should the federal government penalty change or be scrapped.
Many legislators and Lujan Grisham tout what they call “nationally leading” methane capture rules for the industry. But rules are not laws, and this session, McQueen again sponsored a bill that would put the state’s natural gas capture requirements into law. His bill lingered for three weeks on the House floor and died there without a hearing when the session ended.
“Frustrating is the word for the Legislature,” McQueen said. “Last year, this year, every year.”
“A mixed bag” is how Lujan Grisham described it to Capital & Main.
“Not having the 98% capture requirement in statute makes the entire methane rule vulnerable to wholesale repeal by a future administration,” Lujan Grisham said. “The legislature denied too many common sense regulatory changes.”
Another bill, sponsored by state Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque), would have set in law one of Lujan Grisham’s first acts upon taking office in 2019, calling on the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by at least 45% by 2030 compared to 2005 levels. That would likely require dramatic reductions in oilfield emissions by the industry. The New Mexico Oil and Gas Association took out a $126,000 online ad campaign to help defeat the bill, targeting both Stewart and state Sen. Benny Shendo (D-Jemez Pueblo). Later, in a Senate Finance Committee hearing, Shendo sided with all of the committee’s Republicans and state Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup) to kill the bill. Muñoz is one of the top 10 recipients of oil and gas campaign contributions in the Legislature.
Asked how the industry fared in the session, Missi Currier, president and CEO of the New Mexico Oil and Gas Association, said, “NMOGA members sincerely appreciate the legislators who understand the vital role the oil and gas industry plays in New Mexico’s economy.”
The Legislature doesn’t only haggle over new laws; it also budgets for the state’s two oil and gas enforcement agencies as well.










Ozone levels in New Mexico’s portion of the Permian Basin have exceeded Clean Air Act standards for six years now, and the EPA hasn’t acted.


 
The Oil Conservation Division of the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department is the primary enforcer of New Mexico’s oilfield rules. It also supported several new regulatory bills that would have updated portions of its foundational Oil and Gas Act, which hasn’t seen a major update in decades. This is the third session in a row that updates to the Act have died of inertia.
One example: a bill that would have increased penalties and fees that haven’t changed in years and was forcefully supported by the Oil Conservation Division made it through two committee hearings and then stalled. Lujan Grisham said its failure “continues a distressing trend” of the Legislature not passing bills the Oil Conservation Division has repeatedly asked for.
Speaking at a legislative committee hearing in November, Melanie Kenderdine, the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department secretary, said that New Mexico ranked second among states in oil production, but ninth in regulatory staffing, and she asked for more staff.
In the end, the division received a $7,992,700 budget increase over last year, $4.9 million of that in federal funding, according to Sidney Hill, the public information officer for the Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department. But, he said, “There are no additional positions added for OCD in the operating budget.”
And, he said, “None of [the EPA] actions would overturn EMNRD regulations or programs designed to protect the environment and move our state to a clean-energy future.”
It’s a different story at the state’s Environment Department, which, for the past few years, has had a rocky relationship with Sen. Muñoz, head of the Senate Finance Committee and the overarching Legislative Finance Committee.
This year, the Environment Department is restructuring to consolidate multiple enforcement agencies currently spread across the department’s many programs into a single Compliance and Enforcement Division. And the Legislature doesn’t give money in a lump sum to the department — it specifies how much goes to each division within. Drew Goretzka, director of communications at the Environment Department, said that while the department’s overall budget remained flat year-on-year in the Legislature’s main finance bill, the new Compliance and Enforcement Division received only half of its $6 million request. Goretzka said it’s too early to tell what effect that will have since the division is new.
The Air Quality Bureau at the Environment Department monitors everything from quarry dust to asbestos to smoke across the state. Even so, until the restructuring, roughly 70% of its enforcement work dealt with the oil and gas industry. In the past, James Kenney, the Environment Department secretary, has said that inspectors find roughly half of oil and gas facilities don’t meet state rules, and that’s reflected in the enforcement numbers. Furthermore, ozone levels in New Mexico’s portion of the Permian Basin have exceeded Clean Air Act standards for six years now, and the EPA hasn’t acted. Outside scientists who monitored the air in the small town of Loving, New Mexico, said that while the rest of the country has improved its air quality, “This area has gone backwards.”
“Concerning” is what Lujan Grisham called the lowball enforcement funding. “The path forward must include adequate resources to ensure all industries, including oil and gas, operate responsibly while contributing to our state’s economy,” she said.
 











What’s happening at EPA is a disaster … I cannot overstate the risk we now all face. 


– Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, Western Environmental Law Center



For the past few years the Environmental Protection Agency, the Justice Department and the New Mexico Environment Department have worked together on oilfield sweeps that have turned up polluters and sparked enforcement actions. Goretzka said those projects are still ongoing. It’s not clear if that will continue, or if New Mexico will be able to do the work on its own.
“NMED’s air permitting and compliance programs are underfunded,” Goretzka said. “EPA augmented our resources with technical staff, legal staff, contractors, and technologies like aerial surveillance.” He continued, “The lack of such personnel and technology will certainly impact our oversight of industry.”
Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center, said, “What’s happening at EPA is a disaster … I cannot overstate the risk we now all face.” His group has spent years holding state, federal and industry feet to the fire over environmental violations.
“Folks will, of course, fight all of this … but litigation takes years to resolve,” he said. Meanwhile, the EPA’s moves to undercut oil and gas enforcement “will cause dramatic, adverse harm to human health, our air and water, and our lands.”
Joe Robledo, the usually affable press officer for the EPA Region 6 office that oversees New Mexico, responded to questions about the March 12 announcement with uncharacteristic bluster mirroring Zeldin’s original announcement:
“With Administrator Lee Zeldin’s historic announcement on March 12, New Mexico will see the fulfillment of President Trump’s promise to unleash American energy, lower the cost of living, restore of [sic] the rule of law, and give power back to the states to make their own decisions — all while accomplishing EPA’s core mission of protecting human health and the environment. In the days and weeks ahead, EPA will provide more information about this effort.”
The EPA has provided no more information in the three weeks since Robledo’s response. It has, however, clawed back money and accused the National Clean Investment Fund and Clean Communities Investment Accelerator — both Biden Administration projects — of “fraud, waste and abuse.” The U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Bureau of Investigation have opened criminal investigations against the two groups, which fund climate-related projects in New Mexico.
“We expect those criminal investigations — which reek of lies and fabrications — to expand against anyone who opposes the administration’s actions,” Schlenker-Goodrich said. “Coupled with grotesque attacks on our federal workers and scientific research, it’s impossible not to be enraged at all the absurd, noxious and authoritarian bullshit.”
Back at the Legislature, industry regularly touted the billions paid into state coffers from oil and gas taxes — about a third of New Mexico’s $10.8 billion operating budget. Speaking during a committee hearing, Rep. Derrick Lente (D-Sandia Pueblo), the chair of the House Taxation & Revenue Committee, said that oil and gas companies still made $10 billion in net profits in New Mexico in 2024 after paying their taxes.
The industry also directly accounts for at least a third of New Mexico’s total greenhouse gas emissions, according to the state’s latest inventory. And while the Legislature didn’t do anything to curb those particular emissions, it did pass legislation that will help New Mexicans cope with their climate change effects. Wildfire preparations, forest and watershed buffer projects, zero-interest natural disaster loans, flood recovery bonds and a community benefit fund for climate impact preparations — all passed the Legislature and await Lujan Grisham’s signature.
And a third of the money to fund all of those initiatives will come from oil and gas revenues, the industry producing and protecting the carbon fuels that drive climate change “religion” in the first place.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/DSC1659_01-1024x681.jpg,,,2025-04-07 09:00:20.609798

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Heading into the Utah Legislature’s 2025 session, a big question was whether lawmakers would take more aggressive actions to tackle the state’s affordable housing crisis and whether they would preempt city powers to do it. 
The potential was there. At least two bills would have had major implications, aimed at requiring urban cities to allow smaller home types and smaller lots. 
But in the end, those bills didn’t advance. They came nowhere near the finish line. 
And another controversial bill to create a mighty new state agency called the Beehive Development Agency that would “coordinate” major economic development projects, including housing projects, was smothered in a cloud of controversy, leading lawmakers to abandon it for the time being. 
For a session underscored by a theme of control — of legislators exerting their power in a variety of policy areas, housing was not one of them. That’s even though housing affordability has ranked as a top concern among Utah voters, according to a report last year by the nonprofit Utah Foundation. 
Utah’s new housing experiment

Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and legislative leaders have also listed Utah’s housing crisis as a top priority. But notably, rather than using a hammer (or aggressive statewide policies meant to force cities to allow more homes to be built), lawmakers in recent years have taken a gentler “collaborative” approach. They’ve focused on providing a variety of planning tools to incentivize cities and builders to build more owner-occupied, more affordable “starter homes.” 
This year was no different, when it came to the bills that actually became law.
However, impatience with Utah’s stubbornly high housing prices did fuel frustrations for some lawmakers, indicating that if the state doesn’t start seeing some significant movement on the issue soon, legislators may be more willing to take more drastic action in the future. 
Cities ‘jealously guard’ land use authority
Rep. Ray Ward, R-Bountiful, the lawmaker who sponsored the two preemptive bills that his colleagues rejected, put it this way when he knew his bills were about to fail in a House committee. He said the state is at a crossroads — it could either “find some way to allow more homes to be built for our children if we want them to still be here” or live with the expensive consequences.

Ward wasn’t alone. Sen. Lincoln Fillmore, R-South Jordan, who co-sponsored Ward’s bill, had some frank comments for reporters during a Senate media availability on Feb. 27, as the 2025 session was coming to a close. 
“I do confess to this year being a little bit disappointed in what I felt like we were able to get done,” Fillmore said. “We’re getting some good policy in, but a lot of the proposals that really would have made a big difference in increasing supply have not passed, have not made it in the consensus bills that are (progressing).” 
Fillmore pointed specifically to Ward’s legislation as “good bills” that he would have liked to see pass. He boiled their failure down to local officials fighting against legislation that would preempt local planning authority. 
“I would say, cities very jealousy guard their ability to restrict the supply of housing,” Fillmore said, “and that is a challenge for people who want to build homes, for people who want to buy  homes, for people like us who are really interested in increasing the supply of housing.” 
Fillmore added that some cities, like his hometown of South Jordan, and Salt Lake City are “doing really great work” to increase affordable housing stock, but he said generally, “it’s been a little bit frustrating this year that really meaningful policies that (would) make a big difference in increasing the supply of (starter) homes just not have been able to move because of the roadblocks created by local governments.” 
Utah lawmakers say no to ‘preemption,’ halt 2 housing bills aimed at allowing smaller homes

The Utah League of Cities and Towns — which represents Utah’s local governments on Capital Hill — successfully warded off or watered down numerous bills this session that could have usurped local powers in one way or another. 
Cameron Diehl, executive director of the League, continually emphasized “partnership, not preemption.” And that message resonated with a majority of lawmakers. 
“While we certainly had disagreements on bills, we were always able to come back to those principles, and we felt like the final outcomes on most bills reflected more of a spirit of partnership,” Diehl said. 
In response to brewing frustrations showing at least some lawmakers have an appetite to take more aggressive actions, Diehl said when taken holistically, legislators’ efforts in recent years have amounted to significant progress on the issue — it just takes time to see the results. 
“Over the last few years we have passed a lot of important legislation in the spirit of partnership that we are actively implementing,” Diehl said, pointing to legislation passed in 2022 that required some cities to develop “station area plans” with housing projects oriented around transit hubs. 
“That is now starting to bear fruit, with a lot of housing units planned for near transit that otherwise may not have existed,” Diehl said. 
Diehl added that the League’s members — city officials — are, like lawmakers, concerned about the housing crisis.

“But keep in mind that a lot of the causes of the housing crisis are outside of what the government can control,” he said. “We can’t control interest rates, can’t control inflation, can’t control tariffs, can’t control material costs, can’t control the labor shortage, and the cost of infrastructure has exploded in recent years.”
What local governments are responsible for, he said, are the “infrastructure and services that make communities desirable and livable,” and “that’s why, to us, it comes back to partnership, not preemption.” 
 “We’ve done some big things,” Diehl said. “We’ve just done it from the spirit of partnership.” 
While the slate of legislation this year was technical and wonky in nature, Diehl said it’ll still have an impact that will help streamline planning processes, create consistency for both cities and developers and, in the end, help increase the number of homes. 
“All the bills this session were focused to some degree on affordability, ownership, sustainable infrastructure, efficient land use processes and quality of life,” he said. “So I think long term, we will see benefits from these bills, improving housing affordability, particularly for owner-occupied housing.”



What did the 2025 Utah Legislature do for housing?
Here’s a high-level summary of some of the most notable bills approved by the 2025 Utah Legislature: 

HB360: Allows flexibility to use some of the $300 million set aside under last year’s HB572, which created a program for low-interest loans to developers who agree to build owner-occupied projects with a mix of “attainable” housing units, for the use of a pilot program in older cities like Ogden or Salt Lake City to buy existing rental homes in order to convert them to owner-occupied homes. The aim is to “reinvigorate our starter condo market in Utah,” said Steve Waldrip, the governor’s senior housing adviser. 
HB37: Requires state officials to develop a “state housing plan” by Dec. 31, 2025, that must “prioritize collaboration over preemption” across private and public sectors. It also creates a “density bonus” option for cities as part of their required moderate income housing plans, encouraging them to consider including an area that allows at least six units to the acre. The “density bonus” would allow home builders who build smaller or more affordable homes the ability to build more homes in a project area than current zoning allows. It also allows higher density projects if developers agree to require some or all of the homes to be owner-occupied. 
SB181: A piece of legislation crafted by the Utah Commission on Housing Affordability focused on clarifying and easing parking requirements. Importantly, the bill defines for the first time in state code what a residential parking stall is to create consistency for both cities and home builders. It also allows that when developers commit to building a deed-restricted, owner-occupied, affordable single-family home, cities cannot require the developer to build a garage. The end result is a bill that does not ban cities from requiring garages, but has a provision to encourage developers to build more affordable homes in order to avoid garage requirements. 
HB368: A technical bill to create consistency and clarify state law around land use. Among the most notable changes is a provision creating an expedited review process for “identical floor plans.” The goal of that provision is to help lower costs and provide an incentive for developers to use the more streamlined process for identical floor plans to develop more starter homes. The bill also creates what Diehl called “infrastructure assurances.” It helps more quickly free up money developers invest in infrastructure — like roads or water lines. For example, instead of waiting until the end of the project to free up the funds, cities now must return the developer’s assurances “system by system,” like when a sewer system is completed. The goal is to create more flexibility for developers to reinvest their dollars in other projects while still allowing cities to ensure infrastructure projects meet their standards. 
HB256: Allows cities, under certain guardrails, to regulate short-term rentals like Airbnbs or VRBOs. 




‘Hard discussions’ coming as statewide housing plan takes shape
Steve Waldrip, the governor’s senior housing adviser, acknowledged to Utah News Dispatch in a post-session interview that 2025 was sort of a “non-sexy” session when it came to housing bills. 
There were no big “signature policy pushes,” he said, though he added “part of that was intentional.” 
That’s because state leaders are in the process of developing and implementing a statewide housing plan, meant to set goals and metrics in order to accomplish Cox’s ambitious goal to facilitate the creation of 35,000 new starter homes by the end of 2028, as well as close a “gap” of homes the state is forecasted to have over the next decade. 
The state, according to an executive summary for the first phase of the plan, is projected to need 274,000 additional homes to meet demand over the next 10 years. However, the market is currently on pace to produce only 220,000 in that time frame.

While the 2025 session produced some wonky housing bills, Waldrip said they’re still “really important” to create consistency for housing developers seeking approval for projects in varying cities. 
Waldrip also specifically pointed to HB360, which allows state funds to finance affordable “starter condos.” 
“That one will probably make the biggest difference long term,” he said. 
However, Waldrip said it will take time — likely years — for those new policies to result in actual homes.
“Housing is a slow burn issue,” he said. “We say, ‘OK, here’s a new tool, developers. And it takes them six months to digest it.” 
While lawmakers ultimately didn’t pass legislation that preempted cities, an appetite for that may be growing among some legislators. 
“Yeah, definitely,” Waldrip acknowledged. “There’s frustration in different corners.” 
There’s a hard reality that state and local leaders need to confront, he said. Local leaders often face “political blowback if they approve, for instance, any additional density. That’s just a reality in our structure.” 
Utah lawmakers shut down housing bill meant to give Utahns an edge over corporate homebuyers

“So that’s probably where the frustration comes to the forefront the most, that even the best actors feel like their hands are tied because their residents and their voters are very set against certain outcomes,” he said. “And that just creates a tension that is really difficult for state lawmakers who are looking at this issue from a state standpoint … saying this is our job to address this.” 
As state leaders work to develop the state housing plan, Waldrip said the goal is to “push those issues to the forefront.” He hopes that as all stakeholders (cities, counties, builders, lawmakers, and others) come to agree on shared goals, that the debate isn’t so focused on state versus cities, but rather what needs to be done to increase the number of homes in Utah. 
“That will drive some of the discussion so that it’s not frustrated lawmakers, you know, punching the League in the mouth and seeing if they win versus, ‘Hey, everybody recognizes that we need more starter homes,’” Waldrip said, as well as small-lot subdivisions and streamlined processes. “By setting that up as the lead-in to the rest of the discussion, you can’t ignore the fact that’s going to require some really, really hard things to have to happen.” 
So Waldrip said as state leaders draft the housing plan, they’ll be working to put together policy recommendations for lawmakers to consider ahead of the 2026 session that’s slated to begin in January. 
That debate didn’t happen during this year’s session to allow time during the interim “so we could really tee up those hard discussions out of the legislative session, where it’s not quite so heated, there’s not the time crunch, we can take some time to be deliberative about how we approach these issues,” Waldrip said. 
It remains to be seen what the statewide housing plan will entail, but that’s likely what could set off or at least preface some of the more significant housing policy changes next year or following years. 
Will Beehive Development Agency help implement statewide housing goals?
Waldrip was among those speaking in favor of the controversial bill to create the Beehive Development Agency as a tool to help Utah fix its housing crisis by creating a “consolidated spot for all of our housing policy to be decided as a state.” 
Though lawmakers abandoned that bill this year amid controversy that it would create too powerful of an agency, they told reporters they expect to continue to work on the bill and bring it back for consideration later on. 
Controversial bill to create powerful new state agency is dead (for now), senator says

Waldrip told Utah News Dispatch that something like Beehive Development Agency could be “a component” to implement a statewide housing plan, though he added “I don’t know that it’s necessary for success.”
“But it would be helpful to have the ability to manage regional projects like we manage other regionally significant economic development projects,” Waldrip said. 
Beehive Development Agency, he said, was “part of this larger discussion” of planning for “regionally significant projects” in order to meet the state’s need of 274,000 homes in the next 10 years. 
“Given that, what do we need to do to make that happen?” he said. “From a housing standpoint, do we have a structure in place that we can make good decisions, or do we have a structure that’s encouraging poor decisions?”
Additionally, something like the Beehive Development Agency could help address “frustration” from Utahns over a rapidly growing state that’s attracting plenty of jobs, but not factoring in housing needs as part of economic development strategies. 
“So putting housing into economic development and having it be a critical component of those economic development discussions, I don’t know anybody that would disagree with that as the policy goal,” he said. 
Waldrip said “unfortunately that got wrapped up” with controversy over the rest of the bill, but he added “that’s a critical thing that we have to address going forward.”

SB 247, sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, prohibits protesters from using noise amplifiers, being too close to the residence of the subject of the protest 30 minutes after sunset and 30 minutes before sunrise, and from blocking roads for the protest. 
Orr filed similar legislation in the previous two legislative sessions. In 2023, the bill passed the Senate but did not receive a vote in the House. In 2024, it was indefinitely postponed in a Senate committee.

“The first version was filed in response to the Justice (Brett) Kavanaugh hearings where people went to his house and were demonstrating outside at all hours of the night,” Orr said. “I thought how intimidating would that be whether you’re an elected person or unelected it doesn’t matter.”
The Senate County and Municipal Government Committee heard from one critic of the legislation during a public hearing. Camille Bennett, executive director of Project Say Something, an advocacy group for change focusing on Black history and anti-racism training, said the legislation was too vague and unconstitutional.
“SB 247 is not only a bad bill but an assault on the First Amendment rights and voices of marginalized Alabamians,” Bennett said.
Bennett said peaceful protests will always be near a residence in rural Alabama. 
“Alabama is the heart of the Civil Rights Movement. Black folk in Alabama understand the necessity of exercising our First Amendment rights as a pathway to freedom and navigation through white supremacist systems,” Bennett said. “We have apartments and residential housing within an earshot of any of our protests including parks and our local courthouse.”
Sen. Merika Coleman, D-Pleasant Grove, said that is especially true in cities like Birmingham that have lofts and apartments downtown.
“There’s so many lofts downtown so where would you actually go to have even a peaceful protest in downtown Birmingham and not be near a residence,” Coleman said.
Orr rebutted saying people can still  protest in public parks and other areas.
“There’s plenty of places to make your sentiments known,” Orr said.
Coleman said the legislation could violate the First Amendment and warned against restricting the right to protest on the state level.
“I just don’t want us, especially right now, especially nationally when some people feel as if our First Amendment rights are being infringed upon, just being able to say what we believe,” she said. “I don’t know if we should be doing that on a state level as well, especially in Alabama.”
Sen. Linda Coleman-Madison, D-Birmingham, said the bill was too vague and suggested an amendment to set a limit on noise levels. The bill currently says that local law enforcement can deem what is too loud.
“It’s not specific so you allow the local governments to make that determination,” Coleman-Madison said.
The bill was approved 5-2. Coleman and Sen. Kirk Hatcher, D-Birmingham, voted against the approval, and Coleman-Madison abstained. It will now be considered by the full Senate.

(Photo: April Corbin Girnus/Nevada Current)Clark County’s decade-long practice of adjusting gas tax for inflation should continue for another decade before being subject to reapproval by voters, a broad coalition believes.
Fuel revenue indexing — often referred to as FRI — adjusts the county’s portion of fuel tax to inflation and has been a major source of funding for roadway projects in Southern Nevada since going into effect in 2014. FRI is currently scheduled to sunset at the end of 2026 unless voters approve an extension next year.
RTC foresees future revenue shortfall if gas tax indexing allowed to expire

For years, the Regional Transportation Commission of Southern Nevada (RTC) has warned that ending fuel revenue indexing will decrease roadway funding by two thirds — from $300 million to $100 million annually. A funding shortage that severe would result in canceled projects and the inability to keep up with roadway maintenance, according to RTC CEO M.J. Maynard-Carey.
RTC’s solution to the problem is Assembly Bill 530, which would allow the Clark County Commission, by a two-thirds vote, to extend FRI an additional decade beyond its current sunset date. Continuation beyond 2036 would require voter approval.
 
Gas Tax in Clark County

Federal: 0.184
State: 0.23
County: 0.10
FRI: 0.23
Other: 0.014

TOTAL: $0.758 per gallon, as of April 1


The Nevada State Legislature and then-Gov. Brian Sandoval first gave Clark County the authorization to use fuel revenue indexing in 2013. The Clark County Commission approved FRI for 2014 through 2016. In November 2016, Clark County voters extended FRI through 2026. That ballot measure passed with nearly 60% support.
RTC currently receives 24.6 cents of the total 75.8 cents per gallon fuel tax, according to Maynard-Carey. 
Warren Hardy, chair of the RTC’s Transportation Resource Advocacy Committee (TRAC), said the committee has “looked at every aspect” of funding over several years and determined that “FRI is the cornerstone.”
“If we are not able to extend FRI, we can fold our tent and go home on a whole bunch of issues related to transportation in Southern Nevada,” he said. “I’ve said it’s existential, and I stand by that.”
TRAC Vice Chair Danny Thompson called AB530 “the most important bill to Southern Nevada this session.”
More than $1 billion has been generated through FRI since 2014, according to Maynard-Carey. The money has supported 702 projects — 501 completed, 105 in construction, and 96 in the design phase.
The loss of FRI would be compounded by increases in fuel efficiency and the adoption of electric vehicles, which already result in fewer taxable gallons of fuel being sold, added Maynard-Carey.
More than 30 groups threw their support behind the bill during its hearing Thursday in the Assembly Committee on Growth & Infrastructure. Among them: Clark County and its five cities, multiple skilled trades unions, multiple building and construction industry groups, two universities (UNLV and Nevada State), two chambers of commerce (Urban and Vegas), Southwest Gas, and the Nevada Resort Association.
“Fuel tax is the best, most efficient way to collect those dollars that pay for our roads,” said Paul Enos, a lobbyist for the Nevada Trucking Association, which supports the bill. 
Just five groups opposed AB530, mostly on the grounds that the county commission should not be able to circumvent voters and that taxes are already too high.
“This takes away the right of the people,” said Janine Hansen of Nevada Families for Freedom and the Independent American Party. “They were promised 10 years ago they would be able to vote on this. … Are we afraid of a vote by the people? Do we believe in democracy?”
That same criticism was lobbed against a 2023 FRI bill that passed the Legislature with bipartisan support only to be vetoed by Gov. Joe Lombardo. That bill would have allowed the Clark County Commission to extend FRI indefinitely without a direct vote of the people.
(That bill would have aligned Clark with Washoe County, which also indexes their fuel tax to inflation but has no sunset clause. Nevada’s other counties do not index their fuel tax.)
“The arguments in favor of fuel revenue indexing are compelling, but a decision on this issue, which impacts household budgets every day, is most appropriately rendered by the voters,” Lombardo wrote in his 2023 veto message.
Democratic Assemblymember Howard Watts, a sponsor of both FRI bills, said AB530’s requirement to put the issue in front of Clark County voters in 2036 is meant to address such criticism.
“A final vote of the people has been maintained,” he said. “We do respect the will of the people while also wanting to make sure that we can continue to provide this critical source of revenue for transportation infrastructure in our state.”

(Stew Milne for Alabama Reflector)There are two sorts of conservatism.
There’s the kind espoused by the 18th-century British politician Edmund Burke. It emphasizes restraint; reverence for tradition and maintaining political and social order through mutual duty. Laws must prevent mob rule at the bottom and tyranny at the top. Change is acceptable but not revolution. One should work with the world as it is, inside a moral framework aware of human shortcomings.
“The effect of liberty on individuals is that they may do what they please; we ought to see what it will please them to do before we risk congratulations that may soon become complaints,” Burke wrote.
You may not agree with this approach. But it’s one that can be defended in good faith.
And yet it’s not the way self-styled American conservatives operate.
They behave more like John Randolph of Roanoke, an antebellum Virginia congressman with a high-pitched voice and a tendency to violence.
Randolph felt no duty to anyone outside his peer group. As for his thoughts on restraint, the congressman added the phrase “Do What You Feel” to his family’s coat of arms.
He only revered the power he and other slaveholders held over Black men and women. Randolph’s single political principle was full control of the government by elites (i.e. slaveholders) without popular will or Washington D.C. getting in the way.
“I am an aristocrat,” he reportedly said. “I love liberty; I hate equality.”
These two threads — respectful restraint vs. elite impunity — run through Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall’s attempt to prosecute Alabamians helping people get out-of-state abortions.
Back in 2022, Marshall told a conservative talk show host that under Alabama’s abortion ban, providing that help was “potentially criminally actionable for us.” He doubled down on this argument in a court filing the following year.
“An elective abortion performed in Alabama would be a criminal offense; thus, a conspiracy formed in the State to have that same act performed outside the State is illegal,” the brief said.
This is ludicrous. Performing an abortion in Alabama is a felony. So is selling marijuana for recreational use. By Marshall’s logic, it would be “criminally actionable” for me to give you gas money to drive to Colorado, where you can legally smoke cannabis for fun.
Reproductive health care providers sued Marshall in 2023. Last week, U.S. District Judge Myron Thompson sided with them.
Like a responsible jurist, he explained his decision through precedent and established rights.
To take one part: Thompson noted that American law has always recognized a right to travel to another state and do anything lawful there. He cited the privileges and immunities clause in Article IV of the U.S. Constitution. And the earlier Articles of Confederation. And the still earlier Magna Carta, which recognized the right of merchants to travel. He also cited U.S. Supreme Court cases going back to the 19th century saying Alabama can’t harass you for what you do within the laws outside Alabama.
“There is no end-run around the right to travel that would allow states to burden travel selectively and in a patchwork fashion based on whether they approve or disapprove of lawful conduct that their residents wish to engage in outside their borders,” Thompson wrote.
Put the arguments side-by-side. One claims imperial power over state residents. The other invokes the past to defend individual rights.
Then ask yourself: who is the conservative here?
There’s the political frame, of course. Marshall is a Republican who praises President Donald Trump, bullies transgender kids and ignores public safety in Alabama to fight culture wars in other states.
Thompson is a federal judge who has upheld abortion rights; ordered Roy Moore to remove the Ten Commandments from the Helfin-Torbert Judicial Building in 2003 and directed the state to provide adequate mental health care in prisons.
But then look at their conduct.
Thompson is defending an idea of individual freedom, rooted in centuries of jurisprudence, that rejects state coercion.
Marshall fights for a Randolph-like vision of government where wealthy white men have the liberty to indulge their whims and hurt others if it advances their interests. It respects boundaries so long as they restrain women and minorities. And one that crosses state borders to punish those who break free.
You can see Marshall espousing this elsewhere. He boasts of joining legal briefs defending Trump’s attempt to deport Venezuelans without due process or evidence of a crime. He has been gleeful about an unelected billionaire throwing Alabamians out of work for the crime of working for the federal government.
It’s a dangerous, revolutionary attempt to create a world where a white man and his sycophants can act without restraint from Congress, the judiciary or broad political consensus.
And it hauls down the rule of law, replacing it with a giant crest that says “Do What You Feel.”
I know who the conservative is here. And it’s not the attorney general claiming to be one.

“We are coming for the bad actors that put profit and the safety of our children. Convenience stores need to stick to selling gas and sodas, and they are not our local pharmacy stores.

The bill includes a ban on sales to anyone under 21; restricts retail locations to existing liquor stores or standalone shops inaccessible to minors, and mandates product testing and labeling. It would also limit THC content to five milligrams per serving for edibles and beverages and impose an excise tax.
A similar bill sponsored by Sen. Tim Melson, R-Florence, failed in the Senate Health Care Committee in late March. While both bills would regulate hemp products through the ABC board and ban sales to minors, Whitt’s bill imposes higher penalties for underage sales. The Senate version also differentiated between beverages and other consumable products, while Whitt’s bill defines all products as “consumable hemp products.”

Whitt said the bill aimed to place “guardrails” on the industry, pointing to concerns about public health and youth safety. During his presentation to the committee, Whitt displayed several products purchased locally, including gummies and drinks, which he claimed were equal to 80-proof vodka, arguing they are marketed attractively, sometimes toward children.
“This is bad stuff, and it’s being sold to our kids,” he stated.
Carmelo Parasiliti, founder and CEO of Green Acres Organic Pharms in Florence and an opponent of the legislation, said that the “data simply does not support the hysteria.” Parasiliti said that the Alabama Poison Information Center reported 235 cases related to Delta-8 THC, a form of cannabinoid, in 2023 and that these cases represent just 0.018% of Alabama residents under 21.
“Most importantly, no deaths have occurred. Cannabinoids like Delta-8, CBD, and CBG are nonlethal, nonaddictive, and federally legal,” Parasiliti said.
Support for the bill came from law enforcement. Lt. Chuck Bradford of the Trussville Police Department claimed there is a rise in overdoses linked to vape store products. He also claimed that testing of purchased products showed THC levels far exceeding the legal hemp limit of 0.3%, but did not point to data.
“Basically, we’re allowing people to sell marijuana,” he said.
Molly Cole, a lobbyist for the Alabama Hemp and Vape Association, argued against what she termed “rush legislation,” claiming it could “eliminate over 10,000 jobs in Alabama.” She asked for a study commission to develop an “evidence-based policy.”
“Instead of rushing HB 445, I urge you to support a study commission. Bring together legislators, regulatory regulators, industry leaders and public health experts to craft long-term, evidence-based policy. Other states have done this successfully. Now Alabama can too,” Cole said.
Becky Gerritson from Eagle Forum of Alabama, a conservative lobbying group, said she supported the bill’s intent but argued it didn’t go far enough, stating it effectively legalizes recreational marijuana by allowing psychoactive cannabinoids. “These products need to be banned,” she urged.
The committee did not take a vote after the public hearing.

While most of us read Margaret Atwood’s The Handmaid’s Tale as a grim dystopian novel, the Project 2025 crowd, and all those they embolden, have seen it as more of a how-to guide for eradicating reproductive rights.
For anyone who hasn’t read the book, or watched the Hulu show (set to come back for its final season this month), it involves a newly minted fascist country called Gilead that has taken over the bulk of what was the United States following a violent coup. A centerpiece of their society are handmaids, women who are forced to bear the nation’s children, conceived through a perverse ritual of rape and slave labor.
Still, The Handmaid’s Tale is fiction. Or is it?
In season two of the show, main character Offred fears being banished to a toxic waste dump in the colonies after she has a miscarriage. This serves as a kind of death sentence. It seems like a harsh punishment for something that occurs naturally—miscarriages happen.
Here’s where reality jumps into the frame. A Georgia woman was arrested for having a miscarriage in March. Selena Maria Chandler-Scott, 24, was found unconscious on her bathroom floor. She had miscarried at 19 weeks. By all accounts it was naturally occurring. Chandler-Scott was released after weeks in jail on Friday, after public pressure. Meanwhile, legislators in Georgia are considering The Prenatal Equal Protection Act (HB 441), which would call abortion patients murderers and could give them the death penalty.
But this is just one case in one state, right? Maybe you live in a state with abortion access codified in state or local laws. Even then you might not be safe.
Let’s look at Nevada. When Roe v Wade was overturned in 2022, abortion laws reverted back to the states. Fortunately, Nevada has a law allowing abortion. In fact, we are part-way through the process of codifying abortion access into the state constitution, which requires two votes by the people. The first was last year and the second is set for 2026.
At the Nevada Legislature, there are bills that would offer provider address privacy protection (AB 235), prescribing doctor name anonymization on medical packaging (AB 411), and repealing an existing law that criminalizes medication abortion (SB 139). 
So far so good, but even so-called safe states have pitfalls. A 1985 state law requiring parental notification for minors seeking abortion is set to go into effect on April 30. The law had been blocked by a federal court for decades but has sprung back to life like so many of its kind around the country following the end of Roe. 
Conservatives like to say abortion is a state’s rights issue, which is what has essentially happened with the overturning of Roe v Wade. Now it seems that’s not enough. The states that have harsher laws want everyone to play by their rules whether you live there or not. 
Take the case of the New York doctor indicted by a Louisiana grand jury for prescribing mail-order abortion medication. While New York has abortion access as well as laws allowing doctors to prescribe abortion medication by mail, the state of Louisiana is continuing to push for felony charges under their own state laws, which criminalize abortion-inducing medication.
It shouldn’t be a trick of the map for people to have reproductive rights. A line drawn here or there becomes the difference between personal liberty or not. And the new wave of anti-abortion bills around the country are signaling that even lines on maps won’t matter much in the future.
Meanwhile the Texas Legislature is considering multiple bills that would impact reproductive rights. As Jessica Valenti reported on her Abortion, Every Day Substack last week, Texas SB 31 seeks to “prosecute abortion funds, helpers, and maybe even patients” while Texas SB 2880 would deputize ordinary citizens to report anything online that shares abortion information. The latter would mean that websites originating anywhere in America could face charges in Texas.
The point of all this seems pretty clear: No state is safe. Not when bounty hunters and attorneys can pursue you across state lines. And no person is safe, even when they are just trying to survive a natural medical event. 
In Trump’s America, anyone with a uterus isn’t just damned if you do, they’re damned period. 
The smart thing to do is to pushback with all our might. In Atwood’s book, Gilead was allowed to take shape because citizens were too shocked by the brute force of the new regime. We must take this as a warning for our very real times.
In our case, we have some tools to resist. States with existing reproductive rights and protections can beef them up by closing loopholes and addressing the modern era. If abortion medication is legal in your state, make sure other jurisdictions can’t prosecute on technicalities like mail-orders or use of the internet. If abortion rights are in your laws, codify them in your state constitutions.
Don’t just focus on your own backyard either, because it’s clear that anti-abortion networks are looking at ways to creep into national bans and regulations by way of shady state bills. Keep the pressure on elected officials. Write op-eds. Most of all, be vigilant.

This story was originally pubished in The 19th.
President Donald Trump issued a proclamation recognizing National Sexual Assault Awareness and Prevention Month — one that differs from similar recognitions issued in his first term both because of its focus and because Trump himself was found liable for sexual abuse in 2023.
The proclamation, issued Thursday evening, is narrowly focused on blaming “a dramatic increase of sexual violence in our neighborhoods and communities” on “the invasion of illegal aliens at our southern border,” pointing a finger at the Biden administration’s immigration policies.
It’s a sharp turn from the statements Trump published in his first term, which largely highlighted the need for more support for survivors and accountability for perpetrators.
The statement erroneously claims that assaults by undocumented immigrants are one of the leading causes of sexual violence in recent years. In reality, most victims of sexual assault are harmed by someone they know. Eight out of 10 rapes are committed by someone known to the victim, according to data from the Department of Justice.
Omny Miranda Martone, founder and CEO of the nonprofit Sexual Violence Prevention Association, wrote over text message that this is a classic case of what the organization calls SORVO — Systemic Oppression, Reverse Victim and Offender. “President Trump wants to systemically oppress immigrants, so he accuses them of committing high rates of sexual violence,” they wrote. “The reality is, immigrants face higher rates of sexual violence than natural born citizens and are less likely to perpetuate crime.”
While research from the federal government has found immigrants commit less crime than U.S.-born people, Trump and his allies have often drawn attention to the tragic cases of American women and girls killed by undocumented immigrants. In his proclamation, Trump cites the deaths of Laken Riley, Jocelyn Nungaray and Rachel Morin, all of whom were killed in the past two years. An undocumented immigrant man in November was found guilty of Riley’s murder. Undocumented immigrants have been charged in Nungaray’s and Morin’s deaths; the trial in Morin’s case began this week. Riley’s murder was an anti-immigrant flashpoint for Republicans, and Trump signed legislation drafted in her honor that now allows for immigrants to be deported for nonviolent crimes. The mothers of Riley and Nungaray were also special guests at Trump’s joint address to Congress in March.
In May of 2023, Trump was found liable in federal court for sexually abusing the writer E. Jean Carroll in 1996 and defaming her afterward. He was originally ordered to pay $5 million in damages, but that amount increased by an eye-popping $83 million after Trump was found liable for defaming Carroll again after the initial verdict.
In addition to Carroll, a number of women have accused the president of sexual misconduct. Many in Trump’s inner circle, including multiple people confirmed to the Cabinet, have also been accused of sexual misconduct.
“President Trump doesn’t care about women or sexual violence survivors,” Martone wrote. “He simply uses his faux defense of women to justify oppressing minorities, particularly immigrants and trans people.”

And no particular worries, as there are agreements in place on most big-ticket items.","The steps of the Maryland State House. (File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Legislators enter the final day of the 2025 General Assembly session Monday with no budget, no energy reform and no bill to alter the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, the state’s sweeping education reform plan. And no particular worries.
While lawmakers will have hundreds of bills to work through today, legislative leaders have more or less agreed on most of the big items. It will just be a matter of logistics to keep desired bills on track, to beat back opposition from lawmakers looking to use the midnight deadline to their advantage, and to navigate the unexpected, last-minute crises that invariably pop up.
House Majority Leader David Moon (D-Montgomery) said that with agreements in hand on most of the “big-ticket controversial items,” such as the budget and a three-bill energy package, he expects Monday to be relatively smooth, even if there are still some official actions needed to pass those bills.
Moon noted that there’s “always something” that could throw a wrench into the last day’s proceedings, but he said that the General Assembly worked hard to ensure to “get controversial bills done before Sine Die.”
One potential point of contention is legislation related to the state’s undocumented immigrant population. Several bills were advanced to protect migrant communities in response to the Trump administration’s crackdown on undocumented residents, but the House and Senate appear to be at odds over a proposal to eliminate so-called 287(g) agreements between local law enforcement agencies and federal officials with Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.
House Bill 1222, sponsored by Del. Nicole Williams (D-Prince George’s), would prohibit the agreements that let ICE delegate some federal enforcement authorities to local officers, including the authority to arrest and check a person’s immigration status through a federal database. But her bill is currently bottled up in the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, which held a hearing on it just last week.
House, Senate quickly come to agreement on spending and tax plan

Supporters say residents in immigrant communities are afraid to go outside and do daily routines because of the federal crackdown. Advocates said they will be pressing hard for the bill Monday.
“We’re going to be present, and we’re going to be putting the pressure on to make sure that they [lawmakers] pass the entire immigrant justice package,” said Cathryn Jackson, public policy director with the immigrant rights group CASA.
She pointed to the erroneous detention and deportation of Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a CASA member from Prince George’s County, to a prison in El Salvador recently. A federal judge ordered Friday that the administration return him to the U.S., but so far the government has refused to comply.
“It would be deep disservice for the entire immigrant community in Maryland, and all Americans, if the Senate doesn’t do what they need to do,” Jackson said.
But a lot has to be done before those bills can happen.
Even though deals have been reached on the “bigger-stress, higher-ticket items,” which should make for a less-intense Sine Die than normal, Del. Brian Crosby (D-St. Mary’s) expects the day will still be unavoidably busy, in part because of the procedural items left on the docket, Crosby said.
“It’s not just pass a bill in both chambers,” he said. “Then you’ve got the yeas and nays, and the concurrences. So you know, it will be busy.”
And some obstacles may be intentional, as lawmakers work to churn out the hundreds of remaining bills that need final approval before time runs out Monday. Senate Minority Leader Stephen S. Hershey Jr. (R-Upper Shore) said that the hard midnight deadline can work to the minority party’s advantage and gives Republicans another chance to debate some of the issues.
“Sine Die is a little different. Republicans have a little more influence because we’re running out the clock,” he said Saturday.
He said that in previous years, Republicans have scored “minor victories” by stalling bills long enough that they blow past the midnight deadline, which kills the bills for the session.
Energy bills speeding toward passage in session’s final days

Some bills have already run the gantlet. Already this session, legislators passed a bill to create a Reparations Commission to study inequality among African descendants, making Maryland one of the few states in the nation to do so. Another successful bill removes a criminal penalty for intentionally transferring HIV to another person, eliminating what some call an “antiquated” and “discriminatory” law after years of failed attempts going back to 2013.
Ann T. Ciekot, partner with Public Policy Partners of Annapolis, said most of the work for her clients has been decided. While she still plans to pay “close attention” to what’s going on Monday in Annapolis, Ciekot said the next day will be a major focus.
“I am much more concerned about actions at the federal level and how they are going to impact Marylanders and my clients and the people that my clients work with,” said Ciekot, who highlighted behavioral health care and other health services.
She specifically mentioned the federal Substance Abuse Mental Health Services Administration, an agency of the U.S. Department Health and Human Services, which recently announced thousands of layoffs and the shuttering of some offices.
Sen. Joanne C. Benson (D-Prince George’s) called Monday “bittersweet” and said she, too, is looking ahead.
“We do need a break because we have been working very, very hard down here trying to maintain and keep the money in the budget to save some of the programs we have committed ourselves to,” Benson said after the Senate adjourned from a second session Saturday afternoon.
“I think that we’re going to have to come back before January because of what’s being projected and what we think is going to happen as it pertains to … Washington,” she said. “There’s still some uncertainty.”

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)With Republicans in control of Congress and the White House, Democrats are looking to make Virginia a firewall — and possibly a springboard — by retaking ground in the General Assembly. 
The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLCC), the national party’s state-focused political arm, announced a seven-figure investment in Virginia’s 2025 elections. All 100 seats in the House of Delegates will be on the ballot, and the group has identified a slate of competitive districts where it plans to go all in. 
“All eyes are on Virginia in 2025,” DLCC Director Heather Williams said in a statement. “Opportunities to move policy and build power aren’t happening in Washington – they’re happening in the statehouses. State legislative races are the most immediate opportunity for Democrats to defend and build sustainable power, and Virginia will be the highest profile, most data-rich election of 2025.”
Though the Virginia Senate is not on the ballot this cycle, Democrats are also eyeing the lieutenant governor’s race as a key opportunity. With the party holding just a one-seat majority in the chamber, a Democratic lieutenant governor could play a pivotal role by casting tie-breaking votes to advance the party’s agenda. 
During his tenure, former Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax cast several tie-breaking votes in favor of Democratic priorities. In contrast, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears has often broken ties against Democratic legislation — most recently in a closely watched vote on contraception access. 
In that case, Democrats used a procedural maneuver to set up a tie by having one senator abstain and another vote no on a right-to-contraception bill. With a Republican absent that day, Earle-Sears was forced to cast the deciding vote — and voted against the measure. 
Democrats then quickly used a chamber rule that allows members who vote against a bill to request reconsideration. The bill was brought back for a second vote and passed with a Democratic majority. But forcing Earle-Sears to go on the record against the proposal was seen as a strategic move — a way to draw a clear contrast on reproductive rights between her and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger ahead of this November’s election. 
Both parties are also preparing for competitive primaries this summer to determine their nominees for lieutenant governor.  
Although the DLCC’ focuses primarily on legislative races, its plan to support the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor underscores the office’s importance in shaping policy outcomes, especially when tie-breaking votes are needed. 
So far, the DLCC has announced it will support four Democratic candidates in battleground districts: Dels. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William; Josh Cole, D-Fredericksburg; Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, and Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach. Each won their last race by between 3 to 6 percentage points in their competitive districts. More DLCC endorsements are also expected after the June primaries.
Democrats also see opportunities to flip Republican-held seats. Two GOP delegates — Chis Obenshain, R-Montgomery, and Kim Taylor, R-Dinwiddie —  won in 2023 by razor-thin margins of 183 and 53 votes, respectively. Both will face rematches this year against their former Democratic opponents, Lily Franklin and Kimberly Pope Adams. 
In another closely watched race, Del. David Owen, R-Henrico, defeated Democrat Susanna Gibson by just over 700 votes in 2023. His 57th District, which includes parts of increasingly blue Henrico County and more conservative Goochland County, is expected to be competitive again this year. Owen likely will face either Andrew Schear or May Nivar, who are vying for the Democratic nomination.  
While the DLCC is focusing heavily on Virginia this year, it is also part of the organization’s broader 2025-2026 Target Map of battleground states. Alongside Virginia, states like North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona are  expected to receive investments, with the aim of helping Democrats flip legislatures or build stronger democratic bases. 
Virginia remains one of the DLCC’s most closely-watched and supported states this cycle, as the group looks to maintain momentum and build power at the state level.

So sponge-like and blank-brained are Our Youth, that if they read about gays or Latinos or Black people or liberals, they’ll get Ideas. 
And if they encounter sex in a book, well, they’ll instantly go out and have sex.
At least, that’s what the Florida Legislature thinks; therefore, said legislature is hell-bent on making sure no Florida student is ever again damaged by the seductive ways of language, even in books teachers and other elites call “classic.” 
SB 1692 says any text “depicting nudity, sexual conduct, or sexual excitement when it predominantly appeals to prurient, shameful, or morbid interest and is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community as a whole” will be verboten. 
No word on who gets to decide what “prurient, shameful or morbid interest” actually means. Some think Judy Blume’s “Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret” is dirty because the main character gets her first period; some think a picture of Michelangelo’s “David” sculpture is filthy because you can, er, see the guy’s junk.
Claiming “artistic merit” won’t cut it any more.
If the likes of a preacher or two, a parent, or Moms for Liberty deem a book unwholesome, that book is gone.
Out of the library. Out of the classroom. 
The Moms and their fellow travellers don’t need to read the material. They’ve heard about it. On social media, Fox “News,” and other “reputable” sources.
Books are destroying America.
Anti-God: Pulitzer Prize-winner Barbara Kingsolver’s novel “The Poisonwood Bible” suggests missionaries in Africa damage Africans who are not sufficiently grateful to have Jesus foisted upon them.  
Anti-family: Anna Karenina cheats on her husband with a Russian count, then kills herself.
Gay-friendly: And Tango Makes Three is about a penguin chick being raised by two male penguins.  
This one could make children want to become homosexual. Or flightless birds. 
Smut: The heroine of “Their Eyes Were Watching God” by Orange County’s own Zora Neale Hurston likes sex way too much.  
All these books have been banned in various Florida school districts.
‘Things in their minds’
Sen. Stan McClain of Ocala, sponsor of SB1692, says, “The biggest thing we should be doing in life is trying make sure that our children are growing up with the most knowledge that they can have without a lot of other things in their minds.”
  Sen. Stan McClain via Florida House
Things in their minds such as, say, the workings of their own bodies. Tolerance of others. Questioning authority. 
This nonsense is presented as concern for children. It is the opposite.  
Florida’s government doesn’t care about kids.  
The state has — once again — refused to apply for a federal food program that helps people feed their families in the summer when school’s out.
When there’s no free or reduced lunch, many children may not get lunch at all. The state Department of Children and Families claims the $259 million in federal money is “welfare” (as if that’s a dirty word) and has some kind of Deep State strings attached.
Florida, they claim, can take care of its own.
Except Florida doesn’t take care of its own: One in five children in this state lacks access to nutritious food. 
In other words, kids go hungry here in one of the richest states in America.
While Sen. Lori Berman has introduced a bill to provide free breakfast and lunch to all schoolchildren, the Musk administration wants to cut aid, forcing states to fund SNAP benefits and other programs for the poor. 
The nonpartisan Florida Policy Institute calls this “catastrophic.”
There’s no guarantee the state will pick up the slack. A bill similar to Berman’s died last year.
Meanwhile, the House of Representatives has again voted to lower the age at which young people can buy rifles and shotguns from 21 to 18. 
OK, they’re not allowed to drink (because that could be dangerous), but they can vote and join the army, so why not let them play with instruments of death?
Nikolas Cruz was 19 when he shot up Marjorie Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, killing 14 students and three staff members.
A hopeful sign: In a rare fit of good sense, efforts to allow college students to pack heat on campus has once again failed in the Legislature. 
Lest you get giddy, 1. That bill will almost certainly be back next year; and 2. There’s also a bill to repeal the state ban on bump stocks for the under-21s.
In case you don’t spend time hanging around with gun-crazed sociopaths, a bump stock is a device that allows a semiautomatic rifle to basically rock and back forth while you keep the trigger depressed, mimicking full auto fire. The Las Vegas concert shooter, the guy who murdered 60 people in 2017, used bump stocks. In response, Republicans, Democrats, the NRA, and President Donald Trump all supported a federal ban. It passed in Congress. 
Renditions, child labor
Then the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the ban, and now Sen. McClain (see above) thinks it’s unfair to stop anyone, no matter how angry, deranged, or obviously homicidal they might be, from what is almost a fully-automatic weapon.
Even teenagers! This is the Free State of Florida, where you are free to shoot at anything that scares or annoys you
But then, schoolchildren need a dose of real life, don’t they?
Venezuelans, Salvadorans, Mexicans, Haitians, and their ilk used to do Florida’s fruit-picking, toilet-cleaning, pool-scooping, house-framing, grass-mowing and floor-sweeping. 
Now the Trumpists are deporting those people to El Salvador and Guantánamo, sometimes for having tattoos, sometimes just for looking kind of not white. 
No matter: Florida needs to exploit our homegrown children to answer the call and get to laboring. 
Make ‘em earn their keep.
Gov. DeSantis huffs, “That’s how it used to be when I was growing up.”

Sen. Jay Collins of Hillsborough agrees. His bill would repeal required parental consent for a kid to work more than 30 hours a week when school is in session. If the kids are 16 or 17, they can work six days in a row. If you homeschool your 14-year-old, or if he or she learns online, that kid can work overnight shifts.
Water breaks and other such fripperies will no longer be required.
Collins calls it “workforce development” and says it will “empower minors to gain valuable skills and experience in a responsible and structured work environment.”
In olden times, kids would gain “valuable skills” picking oranges, chopping cotton, dragging a seine net at dawn and then again at midnight, logging the forest, and then going out to shoot a mess of squirrels for supper.
Happy days: Everybody went to church, men were men, women cooked and children contributed to capitalism. 
In Victorian England, the Royal Commission on Popular Education declared it is “far better that a child should go to work at the earliest age at which it can bear the physical exertion than that it should remain at school.” 
Children working in the factories or down the mines could be paid as little two pennies a day. 
The Florida Legislature probably thinks that’s fine. Indeed, there’s a bill allowing kids to “opt out” of the lawful minimum wage.
Because indentured servitude builds character.
Sen. Jonathan Martin of Fort Myers thinks interns, apprentices, and “pre-apprentices” should trade their right to make fair money for alleged transferrable skills, preparing them for future low-wage jobs.
Some employers can’t believe their luck: It’s almost as good as exploiting undocumented workers.
Doctors are terrified
And speaking of Victorians, those teenaged hussies going around flaunting themselves had better watch it. 
Sen. Erin Grall of Vero Beach  wants parents to police their children’s sexuality.  Which is frankly a bit weird.
If your 17-year-old needs treatment for a sexually transmitted disease, the parents have to OK it; if she wants birth control, the parents have to OK it. 
You can see the problem with this. If a 15-year-old is raped or molested by a family member or if her parents are abusive, emotionally or physically, she could end up with AIDS, human papilloma virus, or maybe syphilis.
Or pregnant. 
But Sen. Grall would rather your child have a child, possibly wrecking her life, than get an abortion.
Grall was the chief driver of Florida’s six-week abortion limit.
The only way a minor can terminate the pregnancy (which, at six weeks, she probably won’t even know about) is if she can prove rape or incest or if she’s at death’s door because of life-threatening complications.
Even then, her chances of survival won’t be good: Grall has a new bill which would allow people to file suit over the “wrongful death” of a fetus.
Doctors are terrified now: Florida already has a critical lack of OB-GYNs. This bill would make them even more reluctant to intervene in a medical emergency. The mother, the father, whoever, could get lawyered up and take them to court.
Under this bill, parents could claim mental anguish, loss of “services,” and “the decedent’s probable gross income after taxes.”  
The upshot is, by God, that fetus could have grown up to be a billionaire, and its parents have every right to cash in on what is a completely fictional scenario!
The courts will love that one.
‘For the children’
Grall, Martin, McClain and, of course, the governor, will say in pious voices they do everything “for the children.”
Everything’s always “for the children.”
But you can bet none of their children will work for sub-minimum wage 30 hours a week to help support the family while also trying to finish 9th grade.  
Their children will have time to play sports, play in the band, go on school trips, be a kid.
If one of their sons gets an STI, he’ll get great medical care.
If one of their daughters gets pregnant, she will, as the privileged classes say, be “taken care of” out of state.
Florida’s powerful will always protect their own children.
They don’t give a damn about yours.

Knightstown knows this situation all too well. The town, situated in the southern portion of Henry County, is 25 minutes away from the county seat, New Castle, which has their own EMS services and hospital. But sometimes the New Castle EMS may have other calls to answer, so it could be anywhere from 45 minutes to an hour for EMS to get to Knightstown. Volunteer Kevin Richey understands this; he has volunteered for many years as an EMT.
“We’re in a precarious situation down here, with how far we are from New Castle,” Richey said. “Lives can be saved or lost in that amount of time.”
In Indiana, rural EMS have been facing myriad issues, such as losing services, decreasing levels of volunteers and rising costs.
As rural communities are taking the brunt of the hit caused by the EMS and paramedic shortage in the state, communities, nonprofits and government officials are taking action to provide more coverage for rural areas.
Help from the community and the Statehouse
Since January 2023, Knightstown has not had immediate emergency medical service coverage.
Southwest District Ambulance Service had served the Knightstown area and southern Henry County since the mid-1990s, but it shuttered at the end of 2022 due to issues with funding and a lack of EMTs willing to volunteer. In the last four years of its existence, Southwest had lost $96,000.
In Indiana, a third of EMS departments across the state are volunteer; 20% are paid EMS operators, while 18% are a mix of paid and volunteer, according to data from the Indiana Department of Homeland Security published in 2024.
After Southwest ceased operations, Richey asked around the Knightstown community to see if there would be support to create a new nonprofit from scratch for providing EMS resources.
Southern Henry Ambulance Service was approved as a 501(c)3 nonprofit in early 2023, and started a fundraising effort across Knightstown and on GoFundMe to get the service off of the ground. The fundraising helped bring attention to the nonprofit, and it helped bring some funds to them. They purchased an ambulance from Letts Community Volunteer Fire and Rescue, and other volunteer services have chipped in to help the start-up. In December 2024, the Knightstown Town Council approved to lease out a barn in the town for Southern Henry Ambulance Service to use as their base of operations.

Besides government-supported types of EMS, other service providers have chipped in to fill the need with EMS support across the state. IDHS data shows that 9% of EMS providers are hospital-based and 6.2% are private.
Currently, Richey is in the process of writing grants to various organizations to help get some money that will allow them to start making runs. He said that once more funding comes through, there are service companies willing to offer their services at a discount.
Help has been coming from the state government in recent years to alleviate the financial stress of public safety. Kraig Kinney, state EMS director, said that his division got legislative funding for the first time in 2023, to the tune of $6.4 million a year. With that money the EMS division began offering grants for EMS services for equipment, training support and mobile integrated healthcare.
“Our idea was that it would help particularly the rural areas of the state, and help them get modern, innovative equipment,” Kinney said.
Because of the success of the grant programs these past few years, the EMS division of IDHS will continue to offer grants in the future. Kinney believes that there are misunderstandings with EMS funding. He says that people believe that billing covers the cost for operating that ambulance, however that is not the case, because there are many other expenses factored in as well, and that can cause competition for funding at the municipal level.
“EMS has an income source, but it is not a sufficient income source,” Kinney said.
In rural communities across Indiana, Richey believes that it is important that local communities chip in and help their areas have an adequate emergency response.
“You should have the same support, no matter if you are in New York City or Knightstown,” Richey said. “These areas get overlooked because we don’t have the voice that a larger community does. We need people to shout and get people’s attention that we need these services.”
Keeping afloat with taxes
Almost half of Fayette County’s residents live in rural areas. Exacerbating issues is the fact the county lost its only hospital, Fayette Regional Health in Connersville, in 2019. Eighteen of Indiana’s 92 counties do not have a hospital in their county, according to Indiana Department of Health data. This has put an additional strain on its existing EMS operations. Runs that used to take two to three minutes to make now take about 30 to 35 minutes.
“We have no surgery services here in the county,” Fayette County EMS chief Clint Hardin said. “We spend a lot more time taking patients to other facilities, either in Rushville or in Richmond.”
To combat the additional time needed to make runs, Hardin needed to have more staff available on call, and sometimes calls that the county EMS were taking would put them at a loss. Hardin says this is because Fayette County is an economically depressed county, and one where a sizable chunk of its residents are on either Medicare or Medicaid.

Fayette County EMS is funded half by Fayette County and half by the city of Connersville; in 2024, both the Connersville City Council and the Fayette County Council approved a 0.25% public safety tax on income to go toward providing more funds to the county’s various public safety services. Hardin said the funding from the tax allowed him to give his employees a $5,000 raise.
“There was about a decade or a decade and a half where no one got raises in this town,” Hardin said. “It was making us not an attractive place to work.”
Government funding makes up for the majority of EMS funding in the state. IDHS data found two-thirds of all EMS funding came from government funding, 24% came from health care funding and 8% came from other various funding sources. Over the past few years across the state, counties have begun to increase their public safety taxes; for example, last year in Henry County the local public safety tax increased from .25% to .42%.
With the potential implications of Senate Bill 1 — a measure to reduce property taxes — public safety services in rural counties are vulnerable. Hardin said that now more than ever, emergency departments are becoming the safety net of a community, especially in a county that does not have a hospital.
“What people kinda lose sight of is property taxes is the only tax that we pay that is 99% local,” he said. “That funds police, fire, EMS, your streets, your parks, your libraries, your schools. You get to see the benefit of your tax dollars.”

(Getty Images)Indiana’s teachers dedicate their lives to shaping the future of our state. They work long hours and go above and beyond for their students, playing an essential role in strengthening our communities. To ensure Indiana remains a place where talented educators want to teach and stay, we must continue to invest in policies that strengthen the teaching profession and support the educators who shape our future workforce.
Senate Bill 146, authored by GOP Sen. Linda Rogers, would raise the minimum teacher salary to $45,000; require schools to allocate at least 65% of their state funding to teacher compensation; and provide at least 20 days of paid parental leave for full-time teachers — policies that ISTA has long championed. 

The average teacher salary in Indiana during the last school year was recorded at $60,557 — up from $58,531 the year prior —  according to the 2023-24 state teacher compensation report by the Indiana Education Employment Relations Board (IEERB). Before that, average annual salaries were $56,609 in 2021-2022 and $ 53,991 in 2020-21.
The lowest teacher salary reported was $40,000 — the current state-mandated minimum. The highest was $110,000. Teacher pay is ultimately set by local school districts.

These priorities, which Gov. Mike Braun and legislative leaders support, represent a significant step toward making the teaching profession more competitive and sustainable in our state. ISTA supports this legislation and appreciates the leadership of the governor and lawmakers in recognizing the importance of investing in teachers.
The lowest teacher salary reported was $40,000 — the current state-mandated minimum. The highest was $110,000. Teacher pay is ultimately set by local school districts.
Competitive salaries and benefits are essential to strengthening Indiana’s schools. Polling among Indiana educators shows that nearly two-thirds are dissatisfied with current conditions in the profession, and nearly one in four is considering leaving within the next two to three years. One of the top reasons? Low pay and increasing burnout. Retaining experienced educators and attracting new talent is critical to ensuring stability in our schools and improving student learning outcomes. Braun has made it clear that increasing teacher pay is a priority and now is the time for unified action.
Raising salaries and providing paid parental leave are policies that will help attract and retain talented educators, ensuring that Indiana students continue to receive the high-quality public education they deserve. Providing at least 20 days of paid parental leave is especially important, as it recognizes that teachers — like workers in other professions — shouldn’t have to choose between spending time growing their families and thriving in their careers.
SB146 reinforces the critical role that teachers play in student success by directing more resources toward teacher compensation. Research consistently shows that when teachers are well-supported, student achievement improves. Directing more education funding toward educators will strengthen classrooms, increase individualized student support and enhance long-term educational outcomes.
ISTA and its members appreciate efforts to improve pay and benefits for Indiana’s educators and look forward to continued collaboration with the governor and lawmakers. Investing in teacher pay, ensuring that a greater share of education funding supports educators and expanding paid parental leave will strengthen Indiana’s teaching profession. We encourage continued progress on SB146, recognizing its potential to make a meaningful impact on public education.

In their bipartisan capital budget plans released last week, the Senate budgets [&#8230;]","An apartment building construction site in Olympia, Washington in January 2025. (Photo by Bill Lucia/Washington State Standard)Over the next few weeks, lawmakers in Washington’s state House and Senate need to resolve significant differences on new taxes, education funding, furloughs for state employees and much, much more. 
But on money for the state’s Housing Trust Fund, the gap is small.
In their bipartisan capital budget plans released last week, the Senate budgets $600 million for Washington’s primary source of affordable housing funding. The House earmarked $598 million.
Both plans are substantial hikes over the current biennium, for which lawmakers sent over $527 million to the fund. That hefty sum helped earn 2023 the title “The Year of Housing” in the Washington Legislature. 
The bipartisan proposals are also more than the $536 million that Gov. Jay Inslee proposed in December. The only input Gov. Bob Ferguson’s office gave on the Senate’s capital budget was to stay close to Inslee’s funding on the trust fund.
Still, the Senate’s lead capital budget writer went beyond that baseline. 
“It’s been no surprise that I wanted housing,” said Yasmin Trudeau, D-Tacoma. “I’ve supported housing policy, I’ve supported supply, stabilization, I’ve supported anything related to housing. A lot of that is based on my own lived experience. So I know the need is acute.”
The Housing Trust Fund isn’t the only pot of money for homes in the capital budgets. The House version has nearly $724 million for housing, including the Housing Trust Fund dollars. The Senate figure is $770 million.
Much of that extra money pays for connecting utilities to affordable housing. The Senate budgets $65 million for this. The House has $100 million, including $10 million for the long-planned redevelopment of Fort Lawton in Seattle. 
The Senate plan also looks to put nearly $36 million toward developing more housing near transit. The House has $10 million dedicated to shelter and housing for youth.
Lawmakers are trying to tackle an estimated million-home shortfall over the next two decades as the state grows. And half of those added homes would need to be affordable to those making less than half of the median income, according to a state Department of Commerce report last year.
Washington is 230,000 affordable units shy of what it needs for those households. The state needs nearly 22,000 new units per year through 2044, but averaged just 7,000 from 2016 to 2023.
Meanwhile, the number of housing permits has declined the past two years, likely due to rising construction costs and higher interest rates. Affordability continues to be a major issue, as rents climb faster than incomes.
Advocates applauded the new proposed investment.
“Your investments to increase the supply of affordable homes across the state will significantly transform lives,” Michele Thomas, the director of policy and advocacy for the Washington Low Income Housing Alliance, told a Senate committee last week. 
Jesse Simpson, of the Housing Development Consortium, called the House’s proposal “bold and necessary steps to address our state’s deep shortage of affordable housing.”
Getting specific
Founded in 1986 to finance housing for low-income Washingtonians, the Housing Trust Fund has since invested $2 billion to help build over 58,000 units.
The funding mostly goes to the state Department of Commerce to dole out via competitive grants, like the roughly $100 million both chambers earmarked for permanent supportive housing, the more than $200 million for multifamily rental units and the $50 million to $55 million for housing for people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Each proposal also has $50 million in the trust fund to preserve existing housing.
Most of the money goes toward grants for construction, but can also be used for rental subsidies and assistance on down payments for first-time homebuyers.
The House blueprint budgets $80 million for homeownership help, while the Senate sets aside $75 million.
Lawmakers continue to show their “commitment to affordable housing and affordable homeownership, and move us closer to our goal of 20% of the Housing Trust Fund being dedicated to affordable homeownership,” said Ryan Donohue, the chief advocacy officer for Habitat for Humanity Seattle-King & Kittitas Counties.
The budgets also include money tied to specific projects. In the House, those include $4.5 million for a shelter organization in King County, $5 million for the YWCA based in Wenatchee and $2 million for an 80-unit transit-oriented development project in Tacoma. 
And in the Senate, there is $8 million for a 17-story affordable housing project near the University of Washington, $2 million for older adult housing in Yakima and another $2 million for refugee and immigrant housing in Tacoma.
The Senate unanimously approved its capital budget plan Saturday, kicking off a few weeks of negotiations between the two chambers before arriving at a consensus. The legislative session is slated to end April 27.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/apartment-construction-olympia-2025-scaled-e1739921767650-1024x650.jpg,,,2025-04-07 07:05:18.586343

On Monday afternoon, the state Senate Fiscal Review Committee will hold [&#8230;]","Missouri House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins of Bowing Green speaks during debate Feb. 11 on his bill exempting capital gains from the state income tax (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).The price tag for a tax cut poised for passage in the Missouri General Assembly is likely many times bigger than estimated, and lawmakers should learn more before voting, the research director of the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy said last week.
On Monday afternoon, the state Senate Fiscal Review Committee will hold a hearing on a bill to exempt income from long-term capital gains from the state income tax. The bill would create the deduction immediately for individuals and put it in law for corporations with a trigger enacting it in the future.
The committee’s only job is to decide whether the anticipated impact on state revenues is acceptable. 
If passed out of committee, the bill would be up for an immediate Senate vote without further discussion. That would leave only a House vote ratifying Senate changes before the bill goes to Gov. Mike Kehoe.
“I intend to pass what the Senate sends back,” said House Speaker Pro Tem Chad Perkins, sponsor of the bill.
In the fiscal note prepared for the capital gains exemption, the Department of Revenue estimates that the combined individual and corporate exemption would reduce state revenues by approximately $235 million annually. The individual income portion would be about $111 million a year.
But federal tax data from returns filed for 2022 shows individual income tax filers from Missouri reported $13.3 billion in capital gains income. Allowing a deduction of that amount would reduce state revenue by more than $600 million if it is all taxed at the top rate of 4.7%, said Carl Davis, research director at the institute.
“I would not vote on this without more clarification from the Department of Revenue,” Davis said. “We have publicly available information from the IRS that puts this fiscal note into serious doubt.”
The IRS tracks income amounts for long-term capital gains — the profit on the increased value of property or securities held for more than a year — because the federal tax rate is lower on that income than on earnings from wages or short-term gains. 
The bill allows a taxpayer to deduct the amount claimed as capital gains from their taxable income on their Missouri return.
The bill is one piece of the Republican plan to eliminate Missouri’s income tax altogether. It passed the House in February on a party-line vote.
Most of the benefits from a cut in the capital gains rate for individuals would go to a small slice of taxpayers. The 23,800 federal returns filed for 2022 with incomes greater than $500,000 a year represent 0.8% of all returns but included 65% of the capital gains income.
When it reached the Senate floor, a Democratic filibuster forced substantial changes, including the delay in the capital gains exemption for corporate income tax returns. 
Democrats also won two other long-sought tax cuts where the benefits will mainly go to lower-income Missourians. They are:

Increased credit amounts and income limits for the refundable property tax credit known as the “circuit breaker” available to people over 65 and people with disabilities. The changes included in the bill would reduce state revenue by about $84 million.
A sales tax exemption for diapers and feminine hygiene products that would eliminate the 4.225% state portion of the tax. Local sales taxes would remain in place. The exemption would reduce state revenue by about $37 million annually.

The combined $121 million revenue reduction in the two provisions is more than the fiscal note estimate of the individual capital gains exemption. If they don’t look deeper, Davis said, Democrats may think they got a good deal.
“They’re running a bill that looks like a 50/50 split between things for working class folks and things for very high income people,” Davis said. “But if the capital gains fiscal note is wrong in the way that I suspect it may be, it’s more like 7-to-1 capital gains to these other things.”
The delay in the capital gains exemption for corporate income taxes is tied to the implementation of additional cuts in the individual income tax already in state law. Those cuts are tied to revenue growth and based on current trends, the earliest date that the cut would occur is Jan. 1, 2030.
The circuit breaker tax credit was established in 1973. People over age 65 and those who have a qualifying disability and rent their homes can claim a tax credit to offset property taxes of up to $750 if their income is less than $27,500. The credit for homeowners is up to $1,100 if they own their home if their income is less than $30,000.
The bill would increase the maximum credit for renters to $1,055. For homeowners, the maximum credit would be increased to $1,550. It would also increase the income limits for claiming the credit, to $38,200 for renters and $41,000 for homeowners, with slightly higher amounts allowed for married couples claiming the credit.
For the first time, the credit amount and the income limits would be indexed for inflation.
The sales tax exemption for diapers and hygiene products is a provision Democrats have sought for several years. 
The circuit breaker increase and sales tax exemptions “sweetens the deal” for Democrats, House Minority Leader Ashley Aune said. But that doesn’t mean they are ready to back the bill.
“This is another situation where we absolutely have to weigh the good with the bad,” said Aune, a Kansas City Democrat. “There’s still plenty in that bill that we are deeply unhappy with.”
Perkins said he likes the Senate’s inclusion of the sales tax exemption. A provision allowing ambulance and fire districts to ask voters for a 1% sales tax — up from the current 0.5% limit — is also an attractive feature, he said.
“We’re moving forward,” Perkins said. “There are a lot of people that say if I don’t get things 100% my way, I didn’t win. I don’t view it like that.”
The bill will have no more debate in the Senate before a vote because the handler, state Sen. Curtis Trent, a Republican from Springfield, formally brought the discussion to a close on Wednesday. Once it is reported from the Fiscal Review Committee, the vote could be held at any time.
Along with the potential for being far more costly than estimated, there are other reasons to delay a tax cut, Davis said.
Federal budget cuts are threatening to greatly increase the state’s cost for Medicaid. The operating budget approved last week in the House dips into the state’s accumulated surplus for about $900 million and the Senate is likely to increase that amount, with construction spending bills to follow. 
And if the bill is passed, Missouri will be the only state with an income tax that does not apply to capital gains income.
“There’s a long list of reasons to budget very cautiously at this moment and to prepare for uncertainty and volatility,” Davis said. “The last thing you want to do in an environment like this is to vote on a tax bill where you’re not even 100% confident in what the revenue liability is going to be.”

(Lori M. Nichols for New Jersey Monitor)Progressive activists argue that a bill sitting on Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk that targets disruptive pop-up parties at the Jersey Shore would instead threaten First Amendment rights.
Lawmakers unanimously approved the bill that would toughen penalties for inciting public brawls last month, but critics argue the bill is written so vaguely that it would punish more people than intended. 
“The way it’s worded, there’s many ways that people could use that to go after our First Amendment rights, especially protest rights. That’s the easiest way to put it,” said Jim Sullivan of the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey.
Sullivan said the language in the bill is particularly alarming amid crackdowns from the federal government on free speech, pointing to the case of Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident jailed and facing deportation over his anti-Israel protests at Columbia University last spring. 
“At a time when almost all of our civil rights and liberties are under an attack that we haven’t seen in generations, it seems to me that legislators should be rushing to put amendments on their bill to protect First Amendment rights in this environment,” he said. “I’m really confused as to why it hasn’t happened yet.” 
Sen. Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) said he’s “extraordinarily skeptical” of those concerns. If there’s a clamp down on protestors because of this bill, he’ll sponsor legislation to address those concerns, O’Scanlon said. 
“I’m not really worried,” he said. “The presumption that we’re going back to the ‘60s when maybe you did have police looking for a reason to go after protestors — I just don’t see that in New Jersey. I don’t know any police departments itching for a fight to take on protestors.” 
The measure was one of a handful of bills lawmakers introduced in response to pop-up parties, which have drawn hundreds of teens and young people to certain events, often leading to fights and overwhelming local law enforcement.
Over Memorial Day weekend last year, Wildwood officials declared a state of emergency over “civil unrest,” and in Ocean City, a 15-year-old was stabbed after hordes of teens got into a fight on the boardwalk. In October, a haunted hayride in Collingswood was shut down after fights broke out between about 200 juveniles. 
The measure sitting on Murphy’s desk would allow authorities to jail someone convicted of inciting a public brawl — defined as organizing a group of four or more people to engage in disorderly conduct. People would also face penalties for concealing their identity or causing a disturbance at a public event. 
Sullivan said he understands the problem legislators are trying to solve with the bill, but their tough-on-crime solution is not the answer. He hopes Murphy sends the bill back to lawmakers so it can be amended to include specific protections for protest rights. 
“They want to get this done before the summer season starts, when they think more trouble is going to happen, but even then, there’s still enough time to put guardrails on it,” he said.

Safer streets, in turn, fuel business growth and community development. These legislative developments — and the changes that come with them — will undoubtedly affect ongoing crime reduction initiatives. [&#8230;]","A St. Louis Metro Police car outside Carnahan Courthouse in downtown St. Louis (Clara Bates/Missouri Independent).The imminent return of the St. Louis Metropolitan Police to state oversight is rooted in the belief that policing remains a crucial force for crime reduction.
Safer streets, in turn, fuel business growth and community development. These legislative developments — and the changes that come with them — will undoubtedly affect ongoing crime reduction initiatives.
Yet, St. Louis stands at a pivotal moment.
By official measures, the city has made progress toward reducing violence since 2020-2021, when there was a nationwide spike. Policing will play a key role in sustaining this progress, but other factors are critical as well.
Research on strategic “focused deterrence” policing, dating back to Boston’s Operation Ceasefire in the 1990s, has a key takeaway: sustained violence reductions require both effective law enforcement and authentic community engagement.
St. Louis has embraced this approach. Public-private partnerships have built a coalition comprised of public health leaders, community organizations, local government, clergy, businesses, credible messengers and residents to form a “network of capacity” for violence prevention and intervention.
This has since expanded to the Save Lives Now! Initiative and other community-driven efforts embodying a proven model: focused law enforcement, cognitive change and services. Such complementary police and community efforts target immediate violence and its harms while addressing risk factors to reduce violence in a sustainable way over the long term.
As policing oversight shifts, it is crucial to assess these community-driven initiatives. We co-lead a research team at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, studying the implementation of community-based violence intervention strategies and whether they’re making an impact. We’ve observed meetings, interviewed key players, analyzed administrative data, and supported efforts to track outcomes and build accountability.
Government-led initiatives often face public skepticism, and even good ideas can falter in execution. Yet St. Louis offers promising signs.
Examples include the Office of Violence Prevention’s collaborative relationships with both St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department and community-based service organizations in its Community Violence Intervention; the business community’s early commitment to supporting violence reduction that has since expanded to become the regional Save Lives Now! Initiative; and neighborhood residents working directly with city departments to address location-specific violence risks in the St. Louis Public Safety Collaborative.
Additionally, the Violence Prevention Commission funds and coordinates youth events to create safer, supervised spaces. Each effort reflects recommended implementation practices and helps strengthen neighborhoods, build trust with police, and support economic growth.
This collaboration is promising, but the ultimate goal of these initiatives is to reduce violence.
Recent data offers cause for optimism there as well. An analysis of official crime incident data shows that from 2022 to 2024, homicides dropped by 25% and aggravated assaults with guns declined 26%. In the 11 neighborhoods where the Office of Violence Prevention first focused its efforts, those official numbers dropped by 42% and 31%, respectively, during the same period.
While more work is needed to ensure that all members of the community feel safe, the results suggest that community-based resource mobilization combined with targeted policing can have an impact and these efforts should be expanded to other areas of the city struggling with violence.
Public policy is full of examples of once-promising programs that ran out of funding or faded over time. St. Louis cannot afford to let that happen here. Violence shapes both how residents experience their communities and how outsiders perceive the city — affecting everything from quality of life to economic investment.
Maintaining a comprehensive, collaborative strategy is essential but it requires continued support and resource allocation from local leaders and state officials coupled with advocacy and engagement from community residents and organizations.
St. Louis has reached a point where it has a rare opportunity to redefine what public safety looks like — one that blends strategic policing with community-based initiatives. This has proven to be a blueprint for successful violence reduction in other cities and it has begun to improve conditions for the better in St. Louis.
Even as changes unfold, the city must hold onto this momentum by leveraging the community’s growing capacity to effectively respond to violence.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/IMG_8944-e1733922327714-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-04-07 07:05:18.586343

Michigan State Superintendent of Public Instruction Michael Rice announced Friday he is retiring from his position.
Rice’s retirement from leading the Michigan Department of Education will be effective Oct. 3.
“It’s been an honor to serve Michigan’s 1.4 million public school children over the last six school years,” said Rice in a statement.
Rice was appointed to his position by the State Board of Education in May 2019.
Pamela Pugh, president of the board, said in a statement Rice is committed to “putting children first.”
“Even in moments of disagreement, his focus on what was best for students never wavered,” she said.
Pugh cited the state’s highest recorded four-year graduation of 82.8% in 2024, measures to rectify the ongoing educator shortage, expansion of career and technical education, and expanded school mental health services, among the outcomes Rice helped the state attain.
In recent months, Rice was outspoken about school leaders’ obligations to enforce legal protections for LGBTQ+ students, as well as the state’s continuing efforts to make curriculum reflect diverse perspectives under the Trump administration.
But under Rice, Michigan public schools did face growing criticism, including from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, because of weak student performance on state and national exams.
Whitmer’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Rice’s departure.
Rice defended the department’s record during a contentious House Appropriations subcommittee meeting last month.
“How do we keep going the wrong way and you still have a job?” said Rep. Timmy Beson, a Republican, during the hearing.
Rice said in response that “based on a number of metrics, we’re going in the right way,” citing rising graduation rates and the increased number of students entering postsecondary education.
Republican members of the State Board of Education last year criticized Rice’s public silence on the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights investigation of the state education department, which stemmed from allegations that the department violated the rights of students with disabilities during COVID-era school closures.
The state has denied any wrongdoing in the case, which is ongoing.
“I expect to return to working eye level with children, work that I have missed enormously these last six years and to which I look forward,” he said.
Before working at the state education department, Rice was superintendent of Kalamazoo Public Schools for 12 years and in Clifton, New Jersey for five.
Rice began his career in education teaching French in District of Columbia Public Schools.
He graduated from Yale University with a bachelor’s degree in psychology, and graduated from New York University with a master’s degree and a doctoral degree in public administration.

The Tennessee Small Business Alliance represents restaurants, real estate firms, retail stores and other local employers operating within the district represented by Sen. Bo Watson. 
Watson, a Republican, is cosponsoring the legislation to require proof of legal residence to enroll in public K-12 and charter schools.  The bill would also give public schools the option of charging tuition to the families of children unable to prove they legally reside in the United States – or to deny them the right to a public education altogether. 
House Leader William Lamberth of Gallatin is a co-sponsor of the bill, which has drawn significant — but not unanimous — support from fellow Tennessee Republicans. Lamberth’s version of the bill differs from Watson’s in that it would make it optional — rather than mandatory — to check students’ immigration status in all of Tennessee’s more than 1700 public schools.  
Bill to bar certain immigrant kids from Tennessee public schools advances in Senate

The bill, one of the most controversial being considered during the 2025 Legislative session, has significant momentum as the Legislature winds down for the year even as it has drawn raucous protests at times.  The legislation will next be debated on Monday in a House committee.
A statement released by the business alliance described the legislation as a “political stunt that’s cruel, economically reckless, and completely out of step with local values.”
Citing estimates compiled by the nonprofit advocacy organization, American Immigration Council, the statement noted that more than 430,000 immigrants in Tennessee paid $4.4 billion in taxes – more than $10,000 per immigrant.  
Watson, in an emailed statement from Chattanooga public relations firm Waterhouse Public Relations, said his bill “raises important questions about the financial responsibility of educating undocumented students in Tennessee—questions that have long gone unaddressed.”
The statement said the Supreme Court’s 1982 decision in Plyler v. Doe, which established the right to a public school education for all children regardless of immigration status, has “never been re-examined in the context of today’s challenges.” The statement said Watson is committed to a “transparent, fact-driven discussion about how Tennessee allocates its educational resources and how federal mandates impact our state’s budget and priorities.”










Do our representatives believe that undocumented children — who had no say in their immigration status — should be denied a public education, even though their families already pay taxes that fund our schools?


– Kelly Fitzgerald, Chattanooga business owner


Watson has previously also said the legislation was prompted, in part, by the rising costs of English-language instruction in the state’s public schools.
Democrats have criticized that argument as based on inaccurate assumptions that English language learners lack legal immigration status.
Kelly Fitzgerald, founder of a Chattanooga co-working business and one of 27 employers that signed onto the statement of condemnation, criticized lawmakers.”
“Do our representatives believe that undocumented children — who had no say in their immigration status — should be denied a public education, even though their families already pay taxes that fund our schools?” said Fitzgerald, whose own children attend Hamilton County Public schools
“My children are receiving a great education in our public schools, and I want every child to have the same rights and opportunities as mine do,” she said. 
“In my opinion, this is not something our legislators should be spending their resources on when there are much larger issues at hand in the current environment,” she said. “We should leave children out of the conversation.”

I plan to join it at: https://downing.house.gov/live.
I have a list of questions for him but the one I plan to ask is about recent layoffs at the national Rocky Mountain Laboratories in Hamilton, an internationally known research center working to eliminate deadly infectious diseases. It is another in a series of mystifying directives concocted by who-knows-who from the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and its “Workforce Optimization Initiative,” sanctified by President Donald Trump’s executive order creating it.
Unfortunately, there’s a virtual information blackout on the Trump Administration’s downsizing process. Government officers and employees are fearful of retribution if they talk, and the congressional majority doesn’t want to risk retribution or being “primaried”– or either they simply don’t want to know the details or are operating on blind faith. 
We can recall “Hogan’s Heroes” and the denials of Sgt. Schultz: “I know nothing! I see nothing! I hear nothing!” 
The loss of two dozen jobs at the Ravalli County laboratory is part of 1,200 personnel reductions in the National Institutes of Health, and part of a reduction of 20,000 at the Department of Health and Human Services led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr.  The justification for the cuts is the same verbal pablum being given across the Administration federal service. 
The reduction announcement said 28 HSS divisions will reduce to 15, 10 regional offices to 5, and widely unrelated skilled offices for human resources, information technology, procurement, public affairs and policy will be merged into a central office.
In its propaganda effort – yes, propaganda! – for popular support, the administration uses its all-purpose “glittering generalities” language with little meaning but big on obfuscation:

The reductions are intended to “reduce bureaucratic sprawl” – determined by whom?
“We are realigning the organization with its core mission and our new priorities in reversing the chronic disease epidemic.” May we ask what these priorities are beyond the glittering generality of “Make America Healthy Again”?

Wouldn’t starting with fast-food restaurants and the myriad of snacks at gasoline stations be better places to start to make America healthier? Get Trump off MacDonald’s and Diet Coke? Who defines “healthy?”
Downing, who has perhaps the best public relations staff and “X.com” presence of our four-person delegation, joins the other three in clicking his heels, saluting and praising without exception the amorphous Trump agenda.
What does Downing really think? Kudos to him for traveling the Eastern District and posting skads of photos chronicling his visits but what has he gained from the conversations he says he has learned from?
There is an election coming up and it is not unlikely the campaign will begin in early 2026 – although Downing already is fully engaged in it. 
It is time we voters know more about what Downing is doing for Montana. Let’s ask him.

But what does Medicaid actually do?,Shalina Chatlani,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/04/07/republicans-in-congress-are-eyeing-cuts-to-medicaid-but-what-does-medicaid-actually-do/,A GOP proposal in Congress could end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid.,"A woman sits with her daughters at a clinic operated by a community health center in New Orleans. Such centers rely on funding from Medicaid, which congressional Republicans want to cut. (Mario Tama/Getty Images)Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

(Darwin Fan/Getty Images)In a letter dated Dec. 16, the Twin Falls Historic Preservation Commission got some welcome news.
Its application for a $25,000 grant through the state’s America250 in Idaho program – the initiative to celebrate the United States’ upcoming 250th birthday and Idaho’s historical role in the founding and expansion of our country  – was selected for funding. 
“We are grateful for your partnership in advancing the ideals of the American Revolution – equality, liberty, and justice – through meaningful community engagement and recognizing, appreciating, and commemorating Idaho’s journey in America’s legacy,” said the Dec. 16 letter, signed by Idaho State Historical Society Executive Director Janet Gallimore and Idaho State Historical Society Board of Trustees Chairwoman Cheryl O’Brien.

The grant was sorely needed, said historic preservation commission member Ronald James, to help with a project that aims to tell the underrepresented story of Chinese immigrants in southern Idaho and their impact on the state’s mining history. The grant would help complete the last phase of an “ambitious multi-phase archaeological survey of Chinese gold mining sites in the Snake River Canyon near Twin Falls, Idaho, and help finalize the establishment of a National Register Snake River Canyon Historic Mining District,” according to the Twin Falls Historic Preservation Commission’s grant application shared with the Idaho Capital Sun.
But on March 24, the preservation commission received another letter, this time from state Rep. Brandon Mitchell, R-Moscow, and state Sen. Ben Adams, R-Nampa, the two chairmen of the advisory council overseeing the America250 efforts in Idaho. 
“After reviewing the Idaho State Historical Society’s America250 in Idaho Grant program, we met with Director Gallimore to discuss how these grants comport with the Advisory Council’s vision for America250 in Idaho,” the letter stated. “After careful consideration of legislative intent, the grant program through America250 is cancelled. … We appreciate your organization’s role in preserving and sharing Idaho’s story, providing information and understanding that educates and inspires. We trust that Director Gallimore will continue to find ways to support the outstanding work you do.”
The March 24 letter citing legislative intent as the reason for cancelling the grants exposed some of the disagreements that have been brewing within the advisory council, the Idaho State Historical Society and the Idaho legislators who allocated the taxpayer dollars to be spent for the 250th celebration.
James, who said he had worked on the 11-page grant application for hours, was stunned.
“It feels like you just have the rug pulled out from under you,” James said in a telephone interview. “In a way it’s like a betrayal, because first off, we were encouraged to seek these grants and to pursue this. This project I’ve been working on for the last seven or eight years, and then right when you’re right in the middle of doing what you’re supposed to do, and you’re having success within your craft, they turn around and say they just don’t know. They say, ‘Sorry, we don’t want this anymore.’”
But it wasn’t just the Twin Falls Historic Preservation Commission that received the letter.
Of the 48 applications that were submitted for the grants, 31 organizations received a letter saying their grants were selected for a financial award in December. The grants selected ranged from $4,500-$25,000, Gallimore told the Capital Sun in an email. In the council’s Dec. 18 meeting, she said the 31 selectees represented $600,000 worth of total grant funding.
Now, all but two of the 31 grants have been cancelled. And the Idaho nonprofit organizations that were counting on the money they say was already promised to them are left wondering why.

 America250 in Idaho Advisory Council wants more oversight of grant funding

Benjamin Burdick, the producing artistic director at Boise Contemporary Theater, said his organization is among the grant selectees that had already made plans for a $25,000 grant in its budget. The money was going to be used to refurbish the theater, which is located in a historic seed house built in downtown Boise in 1935. 
After receiving the Dec. 16 selection letter, Burdick said the theater received another update on Feb. 5 informing his organization that the grant’s distribution was on hold while the program was being reviewed “for compliance with legislative intent” with instructions to not spend the $25,000 before the grant could be reviewed.

“When we plan, we make plans based on what people tell us,” Burdick said in a phone interview. “So if we think we have $25,000 coming, then we start to plan around that. But to then get a letter out of the blue that says, ‘sorry, you’re not getting that $25,000,’ … Now we’re just in crisis management mode, instead of doing what we do best, which is tell stories.”
In an email to the Capital Sun, Gallimore said that while the grant recipients had been selected in December, they had not yet been contracted. In March, the Idaho Legislature passed House Bill 357, which gives control over the America250 funding to the advisory council through a new account overseen by the State Treasurer’s Office, and it was signed by Idaho Gov. Brad Little on April 2.
“Any future use of America250 funds will be at the discretion of the Advisory Council,” Gallimore said in the email to the Sun. “As an executive branch agency, the role of ISHS is to implement the budget and policy decisions adopted by the Legislature.”
The council is made up of the state constitutional officers, state legislators, a private business representative and Gallimore.
 Advisory council co-chair says grant money should be ‘hyper-focused on celebrating America’s 250th birthday’

An Idaho Capital Sun review of the Idaho advisory council’s four public meetings held throughout December, January and February shed some light on differences between members of the America205 in Idaho Advisory Council, and leadership of the Idaho State Historical Society. Adams said House Concurrent Resolution 31, which the Idaho Legislature passed almost unanimously in 2024, laid out the Idaho Legislature’s intention for the money for the celebration.

“We wanted to be hyper-focused on celebrating America’s 250th birthday,” Adams said in an interview Thursday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.
When the America250 in Idaho Advisory Council began meeting in December, Adams said there wasn’t any real oversight of the money for the grants. Adams said he wanted to ensure there was a clear, bright line connecting what the grant money would be used for and the America250 celebration and the founding of America.
Adams said the council  decided to pull all of the grants, which he described as preliminary selections, back for review to ensure the grant applications aligned with legislators’ intentions.
“It was all because the list of grants was pretty large and so the intent was we needed to pull back to make sure the funds go where we intended them to go,” Adams said.
“Not all grants fit with the intent of HCR 31,” Adams said. 
Adams said two of the grant recipients – Boise State University and Idaho Public Television – have already spent their funds. 
As of Thursday, Adams said all other grants have been paused and are under review to ensure compliance. Adams said the advisory council will reconvene at a future date to decide how to spend the money, and he expects there will be some disagreement among advisory council members about how to proceed.
“That is something we want to work through,” Adams said. But for Adams, his priority is to spend the money on one heck of a birthday party for America.
“You only turn 250 once,” Adams said. 
 America250 in Idaho Advisory Council, legislators, historical society have differing vision for grant funds

During the advisory council’s Jan. 17 meeting, Gallimore defended the process to establish the criteria for selecting the grants and pointed to language in House Concurrent Resolution 31, which both supports the America250 initiative and the nation’s birthday celebration and also highlights the need to celebrate Idaho’s history and its role in the founding of the U.S.
“In the proclamation and the resolution that you’re referring to, there’s a lot of language about, of course, our American founding values and liberty, equality, justice — all those things,” Gallimore said, “but there’s also woven through there Idaho’s role, our narrative and Idaho’s place in that story, because we’ve contributed heavily to that story.”
Like the celebrations held in 1976 for America’s 200th birthday, which lead to legacy projects in Idaho such as the state highway historic markers project and the state’s Century Farm and Ranch program, the grants could support efforts that can last and make a historical impact over time, she said.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
She said the historical society went through a robust, year-long process leading up to the opening of the grants in fall of 2024, which included gathering input from other state agencies like the state’s library and arts commissions on how they allocate grant funding. During an advisory council meeting, she said she met with about 20 legislators to gather input on how the grant funds should be spent and held more than 20 listening sessions, community meetings and town halls across the state to answer questions from potential awardees and to gather information on how best the grants might make an impact for them. She said in the public meetings that the historical society also extended the deadline for grant applicants to offer more time for residents to hear about the program and submit potential projects.
“We asked and did focus groups across the state with our potential awardees from (organizations like) county museums: What would be transformational? What would they need? How could they do this work? So this was very well thought through,” she said during the Jan. 17 meeting.
She said during the council’s Dec. 18 meeting that some legislators, such as Rep. Rick Cheatum, R-Pocatello, did give feedback that they didn’t want the grants to go toward projects like deferred maintenance.
“He said he would be really interested in making sure that the grants didn’t include things like maintenance, because he wanted the grants to go for stories and for deliverables, and so we took that into account when we did the grant guidelines,” Gallimore said at the Dec. 18 meeting.
She said the grant application asked how projects would incorporate the USA’s founding ideals like liberty, justice and equality, and “marrying that with the history of Idaho,” including projects that focused on nature and public lands, agriculture, arts, culture and heritage.
 Grants could be looked at as ‘pork in government,’ Idaho state treasurer says

Idaho State Treasurer Julie Ellsworth, a member of the advisory council, said during the council’s Jan. 17 meeting that she has fielded “earfuls” of calls from many concerned legislators that the grant funding was not awarded in line with the Legislature’s intent. She made a motion during that meeting to ask Gallimore to establish a forum where legislators could offer feedback and be heard about the concerns they had with how the grants were selected.
“We’ve worked hand-in-hand with the governor’s office to create those grant guidelines, and the grant guidelines were approved,” Gallimore responded. “I realize there may be a change now, but that was done in the fall, and we’re certainly happy to work with the governor’s office to have him and his staff review them.”

Ellsworth reiterated that she and other elected officials felt some of the selectees fell outside of the vision of the America250 initiative.
“Today I would not be comfortable approving these grants,” Ellsworth said in the public meeting. “You know, truthfully, I feel like that. Perhaps some people would look at it as like pork in government. You know, that’s the first blush you get when you read these things.”
Secretary of State Phil McGrane, who also serves on the council, echoed Ellsworth’s comments in the meeting. He said some of the projects, like funding a new wooden awning for the historic Mason Hall requested by the Lincoln County Historical Society, didn’t fit with legislative intent to celebrate the nation’s founding.
McGrane said that he could fully appreciate why historical sites may need repair, but “the nexus between the roof and America250 is strained.”
“So I use that as an example of the type of feedback that we are collectively receiving and of what I’ve been asking for at times. Like, where’s the balloons? Instead, there’s a roof. … Is it going to be a patriotic-looking roof? That’s, I think, the fundamental question.”
But another member of the advisory council, Sen. Jim Guthrie, R-McCammon, said the projects should have a real, lasting impact on the state and how to continually tell its story.
“If the roof thing, for example, is something that helps sustain a piece of history, that’s important and ties into the greater picture,” Guthrie said. “That has more value to me than a parade, because it has sustaining value.”
In an interview at the Capitol on Thursday, Adams said he took into consideration the concerns discussed at the public meetings, and following Ellsworth’s motion, he said he and Mitchell and met with Gallimore and decided to introduce House Bill 357 and send the letters that the grant funding had been cancelled.
However, the council did not vote on or discuss cancelling the grants at its public meetings. In its Jan. 27 meeting, Adams said the council needed an additional week to review the grant applications that were selected in December. The council canceled its meetings on Feb. 10 and Feb. 14, according to the council’s meeting agendas. The grants were not discussed in the council’s most recent meeting on Feb. 17.
 Grant selectees said they followed application guidelines to tell Idaho’s story

James with the Twin Falls County Historical Commission and Burdick with Boise Contemporary Theater said their organizations carefully followed the grant’s application guidelines, which are 11 pages long. They said they followed the application’s stated vision “to celebrate American history and the invaluable contributions of Idahoans to our region, nation, and world.”
“The ongoing process of the growth of the American nation, that’s what I was operating on, and that’s exactly what my project is,” James said. “It’s commemorating the role of these immigrant workers who first helped build the Transcontinental Railroad, and then some of them came up here and made significant contributions to southern Idaho’s frontier communities.”

When James reached out to Adams and Mitchell via email to ask for more of an explanation into their decision to cancel the grants, Mitchell responded to say the chairmen concluded that the grants did not fully meet the intended objectives of the Legislature.
“It’s important to note that when taxpayer funds are allocated, the legislature, representing the voice of the people, must carefully scrutinize how they are being spent,” Mitchell wrote in an April 3 email to James. “It is also important to recognize that no contracts were issued or signed. I understand the frustrations this decision may have caused, and I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience it may have brought. The grant applications we reviewed simply did not align with the vision we all share for celebrating America250.”
Because the Boise Contemporary Theater is in a historic building, Burdick said the grant helps fulfill that America250 vision by offering a world-class gathering place to celebrate arts and culture and provide a space educational programs for children and adults alike to learn more about theater, and by extension, the nation’s history and its past, present and future role in the world.
“The outside noise makes it difficult to keep in mind that at the heart of what we do, it’s very simple,” he said. “We move people. We start conversations. We bring strangers together. We bring friends together. We tell stories. In our education program, we’re not out to create actors or writers or directors, necessarily. At the heart of our theater lab is the desire to create collaborative citizens of the world.”",https://idahocapitalsun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1327680401-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-07 07:05:18.586343

(Photo by Emma Murphy/Oklahoma Voice)The melodious sounds of a string quartet. The delightfulness of a smoky whiskey. Open bars. More flowers than you’d see at a funeral. It has all the makings of a lavish, big-budget wedding. 
But don’t cue “Here Comes the Bride.” 
These luxurious accommodations and the spending that goes with them are happening in conjunction with public board meetings
A nine-member oversight board Oklahoma has entrusted to ensure that many of our public colleges and universities are spending money wisely apparently feels entitled to live high on the hog while doing so.
It would be delightfully ironic, but for the fact that an Oklahoma Voice analysis of receipts provided in response to an open records request found that the sumptuous tastes of the Board of Regents for the Oklahoma Agricultural and Mechanical Colleges have resulted in over $69,000 in combined costs connected to just 13 meetings. And, that excludes mileage reimbursement requests, which adds another $11,000 to the tab.
In short, every time these regents meet, it costs an average of over $6,100, including mileage.
These board members are entrusted to oversee the Oklahoma State University system, along with Connors State College, Langston University, Northeast Oklahoma A&M College and Oklahoma Panhandle State University.
This spending is problematic in part because our regents are doing nothing to curtail the expectation that presidents and schools must pay dearly for board members to attend obscenely expensive junkets and entertain them while they’re doing the taxpayers’ business.
Records indicate that most often the bulk of those tabs are born by the college or university that is hosting them. That means our tax dollars are paying for them to hold elaborate feasts that serve dozens of unnamed people items like 8 oz. filet, salmon, boneless beef short ribs, pit ham and stuffing, roasted garlic whipped potatoes and gravy and cast iron butter cake.  
Somehow when the regents met over two days in September, officials managed to spend close to $6,600 on dinner, $250 on breakfast and almost $1,100 on lunch.
Most cost-conscious boards would order a few pizzas, get a box of donuts or a fruit tray from the local grocery store, or bring their own peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.
This king- and queen-like gluttony is tone-deaf to the fact that over 1 in 5 college students are food insecure, meaning they’re skipping meals or eating less because they can’t afford it. OSU’s fundraising arm reports that the university’s food insecurity rate is actually closer to 1 in 2 students. The spending is also outrageous given the struggles many Oklahoma families currently face to pay their bills.
And while these officials are living large, four of the five schools that these regents oversee increased tuition. While OSU did not, Northeastern Oklahoma A&M College, which hosted one of these board meetings, increased its tuition 5.5%.
So while some of these campuses are forking out thousands to wine and dine their governing board, students are suffering with higher tuition rates or fees.
How is that a good use of money?
It’s further troubling that none of the sitting members could be bothered to answer specific questions about the expenditures. Only one, now a former member, was willing to talk with a reporter about the rationale behind the spending. Additionally, we discovered that these regents don’t have individual public email addresses clearly listed on their governing board’s website. That sends a clear signal that they have very little interest in being accountable to the public they’re tasked with representing.
The board has faced increased scrutiny in recent days following the abrupt resignation of OSU’s former President Kayse Shrum in February.
And while there are no specific receipts related to alcohol purchases, the former board member said they have access to open bars, and records show we’ve paid for them to have a bartender. There’s no reason people should be drinking alcoholic beverages while participating in state business.
If that’s not gross enough, some of our board attended a “Board of Regents Night Cap” “social,” and records show the OSU Foundation, which is supposed to use donor dollars “to make a lasting impact on the students, faculty and programs that inspire us,” imprudently used funding to buy regents shot glasses and other items to facilitate a “Whiskey Tasting.” They also paid over $1,000 to host a hospitality suite for these regents and even bought them personalized cookies.
Is that what donors intended their money to pay for? If I were a donor, I wouldn’t want my money spent on that.
Enough is enough.
There’s a certain sick humor to the situation given the fact that this D.C. swamp-level of extravagance is apparently happening under the noses of Republicans who are on a quest to reduce waste. Gov. Kevin Stitt, who appointed all these folks, in particular is focused on it.
This is not an acceptable way to spend money. Board members should certainly be compensated for their mileage, and possibly a reasonable hotel stay if they live two hours or more away from a meeting site. And perhaps they should get a $30 meal voucher. But these meetings should not be wracking up over $50,000 in catering costs and thousands more in other expenses like purchasing fresh flowers.
If regents don’t want to serve without all the frippery, that’s fine. Stitt can find someone else who will.

(Wisconsin Examiner photo)A Wisconsin group that helps workers who have experienced wage theft is broadening its tactics to address complaints of employer misconduct.
On Friday staff members of Worker Justice Wisconsin, along with a group of community supporters, showed up at a Middleton contractor’s office where a former employee demanded payment of unpaid overtime wages. 
The public action represents a new step for Worker Justice Wisconsin, according to executive director Rebecca Meier-Rao.
Based in Madison and supported by a group of churches and other religious bodies, Worker Justice Wisconsin has spent the last couple of decades assisting workers who don’t have unions with complaints about their treatment on the job.
For much of its existence the organization has worked one-on-one with individuals, helping them navigate the process of filing complaints with the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD) and other agencies.
“The prevalence of wage theft is astronomical,” Meier-Rao told the Wisconsin Examiner. She added that it’s a nationwide problem. “Every year just millions and millions of dollars are stolen from workers.”
People of color and immigrants are the most likely to be targets, she said. The organization does not discuss the immigration status of those who come to the group for help.
In 2024, the group enabled 103 workers to recover more than $328,000 in wages they were shorted by their employers, Meier-Rao said, but those successes represent “just a fraction” of the wage theft incidents that go on each year. The resolved wage theft cases in 2024 were just some of the 155 that Worker Justice Wisconsin opened that year, involving more than $531,000 in unpaid wages.
“I’m sure the actual amount of wage theft was much higher,” Meier-Rao said.
Not only do those cases  deprive people of their rightful earnings, they also cost government the taxes on those earnings, she said.
DWD investigates wage theft complaints and will calculate what is owed to an employee, but “there’s almost no teeth if the employer doesn’t pay,” she added. “That is not going to deter the problem from happening.”
While someone who steals from a store or a warehouse can be charged with theft, wage theft in Wisconsin “is treated not as a criminal offense but a civil offense,” Meier-Rao said.
Worker Justice Wisconsin’s tactics are evolving as it looks for new ways to address the issue. “We’ve been shifting from an advocacy organization to a worker power organization,” Meier-Rao said.
About a year ago the organization began planning to take public actions to call attention to the wage theft incidents it has investigated. The group developed leaders among the workers it has supported and began building a broader support group — a “rapid response network” that has enlisted 120 community members, union activists and other allies.
By directly confronting employers, Meier-Rao said, the organization wants to draw the attention of the public and policymakers to wage theft, encouraging them to enact tougher laws against the practice.
On Friday morning, Worker Justice Wisconsin organizer Robert Christl, Meier-Rao and a small crowd of the organization’s rapid-response volunteers drove up to the storefront of Stone Concepts in a Middleton industrial park.
They were there with Crescencio Albino, who worked for four years building and installing stone countertops at the home design and remodeling contractor.
Albino, who no longer works for the company, said that he had put in  extensive overtime hours, but was paid only his regular hourly wage, not the time-and-a-half premium required under state and federal laws. A DWD investigation determined he was owed $6,875 in unpaid premium wages for the last two years of overtime work.
Outside the Stone Concepts office, with Albino at his side, Christl spoke to an employee and asked if the owner was on site. The employer said he was not, and Christl asked him to convey a letter to the owner. The letter called for Albino to be paid in full within two weeks.
Gathering at the other end of the block afterward, Meier-Rao, Christl and Albino addressed supporters. Christl served as interpreter as Albino spoke in Spanish.
Albino said he pursued the case with DWD after trying several times to resolve the issue directly with the business. Despite the DWD’s finding, Albino said the business owner has still not paid him.
“The employer wanted to pay the money already owed to me with a payment plan of six months, which I rejected,” Albino said. “It’s hard for me to understand why, in such a clear cut situation, I have to go through this whole process to get what is mine.”
He added: “If I hadn’t honored my obligation, or if I had stolen from my boss, the consequences would have been immediate and severe, but it seems that when it’s workers like me who are affected, justice isn’t applied equally. This seems wrong to me.”
Meier-Rao told the group that the action and others like it were aimed at throwing a public spotlight on a problem that has long gone unnoticed.
“For more than two decades, we have helped hundreds of workers file claims with the Department of Workforce Development to [recoup] unpaid wages,” Meier-Rao said.
“Although we have had many successful individual cases, the harsh reality is that this approach does not change the system. No amount of complaints filed will put a stop to wage theft.”
To accomplish that, “we have to organize inside and outside the workplace,” Meier-Rao said. “We have to be public. We have to make noise. We have to build collective power. That is why it’s so important that you are all here today.”
Responding Saturday to an email inquiry the Wisconsin Examiner sent Friday to Stone Concepts, Andreia Nogueira wrote that “we are not refusing to make a payment. I am sending the payment to my lawyer.”
As of Sunday, Worker Justice Wisconsin had not received a response on behalf of the company, Meier-Rao said.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner.)People from across southeast Wisconsin gathered in the Wisconsin State Fair Park Exposition Center Friday to call on legislators to fund a range of priorities in the next state budget — from education to a new public safety building for Milwaukee to public transportation to child care.
The public hearing of the Joint Finance Committee was the second of four across the state this month. A hearing was also held in Kaukauna last week, and Republican and Democratic lawmakers on the committee agreed Friday morning that education funding was one of the top issues discussed. 
Committee co-chair Sen. Howard Marklein said at a press conference that funding for school districts and the fate of the Green Bay prison were two of the biggest issues discussed during the first hearing. He said lawmakers haven’t discussed any specifics yet when it comes to actions they may take on public school funding, adding that K-12 funding has historically been the No. 1 largest item in the budget and it’ll likely be that way in the future.
“We’re here to listen and input today may influence what we decide to do down the road,” Marklein said.
Co-chair Rep. Mark Born (R-Beaver Dam) added that the lawsuit over Gov. Tony Evers’ partial veto that extended increases in revenue limits — the cap on how much schools can bring in — for 400 years will play a role in the discussion. The case was heard by the Wisconsin Supreme Court last year, but a decision hasn’t been reached yet.

Lawmakers also have a $4 billion budget surplus that they will be considering as they write the budget in the coming months. 
During a separate press conference held by Democrats on the committee, Rep. Deb Andraca (D-Whitefish Bay) called attention to education funding, saying that lawmakers need to “stand up and fund education, particularly special education.” Andraca said lawmakers should adopt Gov. Tony Evers’ budget proposal, which would invest an additional $3 billion in K-12 education. 
“I’m looking forward to hearing more today from all the people at this public hearing about what their priorities are in the state budget. I certainly hope my Republican colleagues are listening and will follow our lead,” Andraca said. 
A focus on education at the hearings continued as members of the public started speaking on Friday.
School leaders and advocates emphasize dire situation
Three days before the town hall, voters approved 57 referendum requests and a total of $952 million in new funding through property tax hikes for Wisconsin school districts. This was an approval rate of about 58% of the nonrecurring operating referendum requests, 65% of requests for building costs and 20% of recurring requests, which contain increases across multiple years. 
While the successful results will help school districts meet costs in coming months, voters also denied over $640 million in requests from other districts, including for Kenosha Unified School District.
Kenosha school board member Todd Price said the failed referendum, which was a $115 million nonrecurring request for operational expenses, leaves the district of 18,500 students in 31 schools facing a $19 million fiscal deficit. 
“As we are frozen in what we can raise due to revenue caps, we needed to go to our local tax payers for approval of the money,” Price said. “Our aim was to keep our class sizes reasonable, vital programs intact like advanced placement programs… which are popular for students aiming to go to college, and we want to retain our staff.” 
KUSD Superintendent Jeff Weiss, who spoke alongside Price, told lawmakers that they have the power to “be a strong partner of public education.” He said the passage of Act 20, a 2023 law to change literacy education in the state is a recent example of lawmakers using that power. 
“I am asking you to do this in the area of finances,” Weiss said. “By raising the reimbursement for special education to 60%, KUSD will receive $13 million of spendable money. We are currently facing a $19 million budget shortfall. $13 million as well as raising the revenue limit… will go a very long way to helping prevent the district from having to seek an operational referendum in the coming year.”
Weiss emphasized that the resources needed to pursue a referendum are “immense.” He said the district held four town halls, 20 small meetings, and five interviews with TV and radio stations in a six-week period ahead of Election Day. 
“This is not how I want to spend our time in the school district,” Weiss said. “I would much rather be using that time to increase student learning and improve our educational program.”
Swallow School District Superintendent Jill Ries said that the small district in Waukesha County has a history of being fiscally responsible, a trait that has helped it weather the “storm” caused by the state’s funding formula.
“We can no longer weather the storm, and we are facing a multi-million-dollar deficit in the future. We have reached the fiscal cliff. We can choose to have barebones public education, but is that what we want our state to become?” Ries asked.
Ries also called on lawmakers to increase revenue limits and at a minimum increase the special education reimbursement to 60%. 
Zachary Geiger, a physics teacher at Greendale High School, also voiced his support for Evers’ budget request, telling lawmakers that teachers have been trying to accomplish more teaching and learning with fewer resources for the last decade and a half. He said this is catching up with the district, which has had to go to referendum and recently had to cut an engineering course for the first time in 12 years.
“Instead of supporting students in pursuit of their futures and responding to the needs of the industries in Wisconsin, this course was cut with many others to reduce costs in order to balance a budget dependent on insufficient funding from the state,” Geiger said. “Please fund public education.”
The tension between public schools’ financial challenges and the growing costs of the state’s school voucher programs was also on display at the hearing.
Glendale River Hills School Board President Carla Pennington-Cross called on lawmakers to stop using school boards as a “laundering service” by sending an increasing amount of taxpayer money to private schools that don’t have “equal accountability, equal transparency and equal legal obligation” to students. 
Pennington-Cross called on lawmakers to increase per pupil funding to keep up with inflation. 
“Your long-term failure to do so means that my district has lost more than $3 million in real spending power since 2009 under your revenue limits,” Pennington-Cross said. 
Pennington-Cross called attention to the significant increases that voucher schools received in the last budget cycle. She also spoke to the disparity between the rate that public schools are reimbursed for special education costs and the rate that private and charter voucher schools receive. 
“In the past year public schools were reimbursed for only 32% of special ed costs, while private schools received 90%. Why are students with disabilities worth less when they go to public schools? They should get the same financial support from the state regardless of their school choice,” Pennington-Cross said. “Your funding model causes people to blame kids with disabilities for budget shortfalls in public schools, reinforcing stigma and discrimination. It is unconscionable.” 
Choice advocates appreciative of last investments, seeking more 
Advocates for more state funding for the charter and private schools that participate in the state’s voucher programs were also out in full force. 
“I’m grateful for the opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks for the additional funding for school choice. Your decision has made an incredible difference for families like mine,” one parent of a student at Living Word Lutheran High School in Jackson said.
In the last state budget, lawmakers implemented the largest increase for the school voucher program in Wisconsin history. The change increased payments for schools at a minimum by 18% and at most by 44%. 
Many of the parents who testified for school vouchers wore matching bright green “Parent Power” t-shirts. A group of about 75 parents were organized to attend the listening session by the City Forward Collective, a Milwaukee-based organization that advocates for school choice. 
Executive director of City Forward Collective Colleston Morgan told the Wisconsin Examiner that the last budget was an example of state leaders moving past “partisan rancor” to take action, something he is hoping they’ll be able to do again.
“We saw the Legislature come together on a package that in our understanding benefited everybody — increases in the low revenue ceiling, lifting of the revenue limits and, yes, a significant increase for students in charter and private schools,” Morgan said. “Nobody got everything they needed… but everybody got something.” 
Morgan said that there were many participating charter and private schools that were “in existential crisis” during that cycle, and the historic increase to the program helped stabilize the situation. He said many schools have been able to increase staff pay. 
“There’s still more work to do, but we’re not today talking about schools on the precipice of closing like we were two years ago,” Morgan said. 
Morgan said his group wanted to attend to express thanks and encourage legislators to continue to work in a bipartisan way to get more accomplished, including raising the special education reimbursement rate, lifting the low revenue ceiling and putting additional funding into the voucher program. 
Milwaukee leaders on their goals for next budget
Local leaders who spoke at the hearing included Milwaukee Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who thanked lawmakers for their work last session to secure an increased sales tax in the city. He said the investments in the last budget show that “working together and investing in Milwaukee benefits all of us because a strong Milwaukee means a strong Wisconsin.”

Johnson called on lawmakers to invest in young people in the next state budget, including by increasing funding for Milwaukee’s Earn & Learn program, a summer employment program where youth can gain experience working with local businesses, nonprofits, community and faith-based organizations. He also called on lawmakers to support Evers’ proposal for investing in 4-year-old kindergarten and increasing state funding for special education and child care.
“It’s our responsibility to ensure that the youngest residents here and young families have the support they need to start off on the right foot as they enter school and the workforce,” Johnson said.
Sarah Kazell, an advocate with Wisconsin Early Childhood Action Needed (WECAN), is attending all the budget listening sessions.
“Child care is a public good and without public investment, it just dwindles and dies in the private market, which is what we are seeing,” Kazell said. “We cannot find teachers willing to do a really essential, really high-skilled, high-stress job for $14 an hour, which is the average pay in my field. I’m personally making $12.50 an hour to take care of eight children.”
Evers has requested the state place $480 million towards the Child Care Counts program, which gives facilities funds to help pay staff without raising costs for parents. However, the program, which has been funded with federal money, is quickly approaching the end of those funds. 
“We need at the minimum to make the investment that’s in the governor’s budget for child care, but that’s honestly just a starting point to be able to stabilize the field,” Kazell said. 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley said the “most important” investment for public safety would be to fund the removal and replacement of the Public Safety building. 
“We have steered clear of a fiscal cliff. We kept the Brewers in Milwaukee, we shared the burden of funding important services and investments with some of our region’s most urgent issues being addressed,” he said, listing accomplishments in the last budget cycle. Now, he added, it’s time to focus on the “generational impact that we can have in our community on public safety.” 
Crowley said that the removal and the replacement of the Milwaukee County Public Safety building, which was built in 1929, would cost $495 million. Milwaukee County has requested $250 million for the project from the state. According to the capital budget, due to the integrated nature of the county’s Courthouse Complex, the Historic Courthouse and Criminal Justice Facility will need to be renovated in addition to the new Public Safety building. 
Evers’ budget proposal included $25 million for the project — a tenth of their request.
“Many of you have seen this crumbling, unsafe and inefficient facility firsthand and that’s why, in order to improve outcomes for all, strong partnerships will be key in this endeavor,” Crowley said. 
Crowley said almost 80% of Milwaukee County’s property tax levy is dedicated to state-mandated services and the county has invested an additional $70 million in state-mandated public safety services over the last five years. 
“The cost continues to rise and outpace our revenues and challenges our ability to continue funding these critical services and make any additional investments in local priorities like transportation, mental health, [services for children ages] birth-to-3,” Crowley said. “That’s why a partnership with the state is essential.” 
Milwaukee County Sheriff Denita Ball expanded on the request to replace the deteriorating building that houses the jail.
Ball said the current set-up of the building, which places victims, family members, visitors and defendants together, has created tension and resulted in 852 security incidents that required a response from the sheriff’s office in 2024.
“It is not sustainable to continue working as we have, and it is not fair to those who come in contact with our justice system,” Ball said. “In order to address the significant safety concerns and preserve the comfortability of core operations, funding from the state of Wisconsin will be critical.”
Other public hearings will be held in Hayward and Wausau during the last week of April.

But the state’s worst tax scofflaw in recent years, a former Omaha business owner, remains at the top of the state’s so-called “wall of shame” despite the listing, raising questions about the list’s effectiveness.
When it was created by the Nebraska Legislature in 2010, the state was struggling with a budget shortfall, and the public posting of tax scofflaws was billed as a low-cost way to force delinquencies to be paid.
There’s been little publicity about the wall of shame since, despite a similar budget crunch impacting the state this year.
As of March 31, nearly 370 individuals and companies from Nebraska and several other states were listed on the Nebraska Department of Revenue’s website as owing more than $20,000 in state taxes. In total, they add up to owing about $22.6 million.
Topping the list is former Omaha businessman Randall J. Thompson, who owes the state nearly $2.4 million in individual income taxes, according to the website.
That’s about the same amount that Thompson owed when the state’s worst tax scofflaws were first posted in 2010.

State Tax Commissioner James Kamm said the wall of shame “is one of the different tools” used by the Department of Revenue to collect delinquent taxes.
“The Department places the collection of delinquent taxes as a high priority,” Kamm said.
One former state tax commissioner, Tony Fulton, who served from 2016-2022, said the list worked for some people who wanted to avoid being publicly listed, but it didn’t work for others.
The state gives 30 days warning before listing an individual or company, giving someone time to pay up before being publicly revealed as owing taxes.
Fulton recalled that it did generate tips to the department.
“It definitely got people’s attention,” he said. “I used to get contacted … ‘Hey, I know this guy.’”
Still common to see lists
About 20 states utilize walls of shame — roughly the same number as in 2010 — according to the Federation of Tax Administrators, a national group of tax commissioners. Some states list only businesses that owe taxes, while most list both individuals and companies, according to Terri Steenblock the FTA’s tax and revenue administrator.

She said such shame walls have a two-fold purpose: to collect delinquent taxes, but also to inspire voluntary payments of taxes due.
A Nebraska Department of Revenue spokesman said that of the $9.8 billion in taxes paid to the state during the 2023-24 fiscal year, about $60 million in delinquent taxes was deemed eligible to be collected. That compares with $5 billion in total state taxes collected 10 years ago and about $26 million in tax delinquencies deemed collectible.
Patrick Roy, the department spokesman, said that some delinquencies cannot be collected, such as assets held in another state by an out-of-state taxpayer or when a deceased taxpayer has no assets.
Roy said collection of taxes due is assigned to a “dedicated team” within the compliance division of the Revenue Department that knows how to find and legally recover assets. He said the state uses a variety of other methods to collect delinquent taxes, such as tax liens and, as a last resort, selling off assets at auction.
The state does not collect delinquent property taxes. That is a local responsibility for a locally collected tax.
Roy, like Fulton, the former tax commissioner, said they could not comment on an individual taxpayers’ case, thus they could not respond to questions about why Thompson still remains atop the most-taxes-owed list.
Why collecting sometimes takes time
Back in 2010, Doug Ewald, who was then state tax commissioner, told the Omaha World-Herald that in general, if a taxpayer has no assets, there’s nothing for the state to recover.

That appears to be the reason Thompson, who would now be 75 or 76 years old, remains atop the delinquent tax roll. He faced a bevy of legal problems starting back in the 2000s.
Thompson owned a day-trading firm, R.J. Thompson Holdings, which he reportedly sold in 2001 for $13 million in cash, bonuses and incentive payments.
But in 2006, a federal tax judge ruled that Thompson had set up a sham tax shelter to avoid paying taxes on $21 million in capital gains from the sale.
In 2014, he was convicted in U.S. District Court of failing to pay federal income taxes he had withheld from employees’ paycheck at his company, American Medical Files. He was sentenced to six months in prison and three years of supervised release.
The money was used, according to court files, for mortgage payments on a luxury home in southwest Omaha and expenses at a Las Vegas casino, the Bellagio. He was ordered to pay $95,505 in restitution, and, as a condition of his supervised release, not to gamble.
No clarity on payments
A clerk with the U.S. District Court in Nebraska told the Examiner that she could not publicly reveal whether Thompson had paid any of the restitution ordered, which was supposed to be paid off in monthly installments of $250 a month or 7% of his gross income.
Thirteen years ago, the Internal Revenue Service forced a sale of Thompson’s possessions in five storage units in Sarpy County. The possessions, according to Omaha television station KETV, included football helmets signed by Gale Sayers, Dick Butkus, Bart Starr and Nebraska football stars, as well as boxing gloves signed by Floyd Patterson and Muhammad Ali.
Thompson’s attempts to overturn his convictions on appeal were unsuccessful, and his name last appears in court files in 2020, when Wells Fargo Bank won a revival of a default judgment against Thompson for nonpayment of $12.4 million to the bank. That court order indicated that Thompson, in 2020, still lived in Nebraska, but attempts to reach him via phone or through past attorneys were unsuccessful.
The Examiner was able to leave a voice message with the taxpayer who owes the second-most in delinquent taxes to Nebraska, Ahmer Khan of Frisco, Texas.
Khan owes $1.1 million in sales taxes, prepaid wireless taxes and waste reduction and recycling fees in Sarpy and Douglas Counties, according to the Department of Revenue.
Those messages were not returned by Friday afternoon.

The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global [&#8230;]","A spawning redband trout from the Upper Klamath Basin, which is located in south-central Oregon and north-central California. (Photo by Jonny Armstrong/Oregon State University)Some already threatened cold-water fish species in the Northwest will not only face shrinking habitat from climate change but will face growing pressure from invasive fish species fleeing their own warming and dwindling waters, according to modeling from researchers at Oregon State University.
The findings were part of a study published in the journal Global Change Biology by fisheries professor Guillermo Giannico, associate fisheries professor Ivan Arismendi and graduate student Arif Jan. The three found that climate change is likely to compel all kinds of species migration that could lead to increased predation, competition and some localized extinctions of once native species in the Northwest and globally.
Idaho watercraft inspection stations are open for the season. Here’s what to know.

Giannico said their models can be run on most species in the world. But for their recent study, the three zeroed in on the northern migration of non-native smallmouth bass and northern pike into threatened and endangered native redband and bull trout habitat in the Northwest. All four of the species are likely to lose habitat as climate change accelerates and are likely to seek homes in colder water at higher elevations.
They created maps using ecological data that indicate the breadth of territory where each species lives and then modeled the impact of changing conditions such as higher temperatures and drought projected through 2070 to see how that would influence the range of all four species’ movement and overlap.
“We forecast how these species would respond to those changing conditions by disappearing from certain regions that will be too warm for them, and appearing in others that maybe today are too cold, but they would be more suitable in the future,” Giannico said. “Because not all shifts are equal, there will be areas where they will be more crowded together, and they would overlap more, and areas where they wouldn’t overlap that much.”
Of great concern is the migration of aggressive and predatory northern pike into redband and bull trout territory, and the increasing likelihood the two will overlap more frequently.
“They all shift, but they end up shifting in a way that the amount of overlap in their distribution is going to be greater,” Giannico explained. “It’s like you have less room to avoid nasty people at the party, and you end up being cornered in the same part of the room with the same people you don’t enjoy, and you’re all packed in the wrong place with the wrong companion.”
Giannico said researchers have long separately studied how climate change will compel the migration of some species and how native species respond to the introduction of invasive species. The modeling done by the Oregon State scientists is an effort to combine the two, and to show how species’ habitats will overlap as climate change compels both native and nonnative species in an area to migrate and cohabitate.
The researchers fear that this increased negative interaction could lead to local extinctions of some native salmonids, similar to those occurring among shrinking populations of bull and rainbow trout from invasive species in southeastern Alaska, Giannico said.

Deepfakes include imagery, video or audio that is produced or distributed without the consent of the subject and has been altered, potentially with artificial intelligence, to make it appear that a person is nude, partially nude or engaged in sexual conduct. To be clear, there are also deepfakes that are not sexually explicit, like the ones depicting politicians. However, for the purposes of this commentary, when I say “deepfakes” I am referring to sexually explicit deepfakes. 
In the past, celebrities and public figures were the most common targets for deepfakes. Perpetrators once needed hundreds of photos to create a deepfake. Now, with generative AI, a deepfake can be created with just a single photo, making anyone a potential victim. 
Victims of deepfakes often experience severe emotional distress and financial or reputational burdens. Victims may be threatened with physical or sexual violence. They may lose their job. They may pay thousands for an attorney, mental health support or to websites that monitor the internet for deepfakes to remove them. Some victims have died by suicide. 
If you’ve been a victim of a deepfake, know that it was not your fault. This is something that’s done to you, not something that you caused. We all have a right to access our phones, social media accounts or dating apps without experiencing sexual violence. 
Technology and AI themselves are not the problem though. Bad actors misusing technology to abuse, threaten and exploit others are. The good news is that there are steps we can take to prevent the creation and distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes. 
AI platforms need to have rules and guidelines in place to prevent the creation of deepfakes. Social media platforms need to have an easy way to report abuse, and they need to dedicate resources to removing sexual content. We know that platforms have a streamlined process for quickly reviewing and removing content for copyright purposes. They need to show the same dedication to removing nonconsensual intimate images. 
In North Dakota, lawmakers are actively working to prevent the creation and distribution of sexually explicit deepfakes. Sharing intimate images without or against consent is already against the law in North Dakota, and House Bill 1351 would make it a class A misdemeanor to produce, distribute or transmit sexually explicit deepfake images or videos. 
As individuals, we need to report deepfakes or other nonconsensual intimate material when we see it. We need to talk to our loved ones about online sexual violence and what warning signs to look out for so that we can report perpetrators before further abuse happens. 
Anyone can be a victim of a deepfake, but teens and young people are particularly vulnerable. If you’re a parent, talk to your kids about deepfakes and why creating and sharing them is harmful. Teach technology safety and make sure your children know that they can come to you for help if something happens to them. April is Sexual Assault Awareness Month, so there is no time like the present to start these conversations. 
Finally, as North Dakotans, we need to examine how we think about and treat people online. We have a culture of “North Dakota nice,” but does that culture remain behind closed doors? The ultimate solution to ending the creation and distribution of deepfakes starts with asking ourselves, “Why are these images and videos being created in the first place?” Many perpetrators of deepfakes seek financial gain or power and control over the victim. But once we see our friends, neighbors and even strangers on the internet as equal, respectable people and not as sexual objects to be consumed, degraded and profited off of, we will address the root cause of deepfakes and sexual violence as a whole.

(Kevin Mohatt for Colorado Newsline)​A​ sweeping executive order ​from President Donald Trump​ w​ould overhaul the​ administration of U.S. elections​ and upend how they’re run in Colorado, but election experts in ​t​he state say the measure is unconstitutional​, and it already faces several legal challenges​.
The order, issued late last month, requires proof of citizenship to register to vote and vote, requires all ballots be counted on Election Day, and threatens federal funding for states that don’t comply, among other changes. On Thursday, Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser filed a lawsuit alongside other Democratic states challenging the order, saying it will cause imminent and irreparable harm to states and voters. 
“This elections executive order is an overreach by the White House and it threatens to undermine Colorado’s well-established gold standard for free and fair elections,” Weiser said in a statement. “That’s why we are challenging this illegal action and protecting our freedom to vote.”

Voting rights advocates and the Democratic National Committee have filed separate lawsuits challenging the legality of Trump’s order too. Doug Spencer, a professor at the University of Colorado who specializes in election law, said legal challenges to the order “will prevail.” He said the executive order is similar to others Trump has issued in that it attempts to take actions that are beyond the president’s authority.
“Some of the executive orders I think raise some interesting questions or novel questions, and some of them are just blatantly wrong, like if you’re born here, you’re not a citizen. That’s just blatantly wrong,” Spencer said, referring to Trump’s attempt to end the constitutional right to birthright citizenship. “That the president can dictate how states run their elections, even for federal offices, is just wrong. The Constitution has clear language: Congress has authority to do this, and Donald Trump is not Congress, so those lawsuits will be successful.”
Spencer said Colorado would have to change numerous aspects of how it conducts elections under Trump’s executive order, but he doesn’t see that becoming reality. He said the order may still have the political consequences Trump is looking for, though, in that it signals to Republicans in Congress and the states what he wants from them.
Aly Belknap, executive director of Colorado Common Cause, a nonprofit that works to defend democracy and voter rights, said Congress has already passed laws detailing what is required to register to vote in federal elections, and Trump cannot simply decide there are new requirements with an executive order.
“States really just need to resist these attempts to override state and federal law through the ongoing legal challenges, and we just really need states to reassert their right to control their own elections and the core of what our democracy is,” Belknap said.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said the order “goes well beyond” the constitutional powers of the presidency. 
“Here in Colorado we’ve been very innovative and are one of the best states in the country in how we conduct our elections, and so federal overreach like this is not welcome,” Crane said.
Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said the order is unlawful and would prevent eligible voters from casting a ballot. 
“The Trump administration is weaponizing the federal government and trying to make it harder for voters to fight back at the ballot box,” Griswold said in a statement when the order was first issued. “The United States has always led the world in conducting free and fair elections, and we cannot let Donald Trump end that legacy.”
Burden on voters
Spencer said verifying citizenship when registering to vote “has the potential to stop non-citizens from voting. The problem is, non-citizens aren’t voting, so there’s not really a problem to be solved.” He said it’s not easy to prove citizenship, and requiring everyone who wants to vote to do so could lead to citizens not being able to vote.
“There’s not really any evidence that there’s a problem in the first place, but you’re going to risk disfranchising people because of the challenges of the documents,” Spencer said.
Belknap said millions of Americans who are eligible to vote don’t have the proper form of ID the executive order would require from a voter, such as a passport or a birth certificate. 
“This is just really scary because it basically takes the responsibility to verify a person’s citizenship status from election officials — who do that now to ensure that non-citizens aren’t voting — and puts it on American voters, making them have to convince the government that they’re eligible to exercise the right to vote,” Belknap said. 
Denver Clerk and Recorder Paul López said Colorado already has systems in place to ensure only eligible voters cast a ballot in an election, with many opportunities to catch anything suspicious. He said the state verifies a voter’s registration information with various state agencies using their ID number, and once verified within Colorado’s voter database, they’ll use the Electronic Registration Information Center to compare with other states around the country. 
“It is really nothing more than an attempt to discourage and undermine voters of all stripes and of all backgrounds, especially people of color and naturalized citizens and even women, from engaging in the right to vote,” López said of the executive order. “This would dramatically impact folks whose name doesn’t match their original birth certificate because of marriage or divorce or anything else.”

López said instances of people who are not eligible to vote attempting to vote are very rare “because the system that we use works,” and if someone does try to vote illegally, they will be prosecuted. He also said undocumented immigrants are not trying to illegally participate in U.S. elections as Trump claims.  
“On its face there’s really just this baseless claim of fraud, especially amongst undocumented immigrants who are somehow voting in these elections,” López said. “It’s a false narrative and frankly it only serves to turn Americans against each other.”
Crane said if the order were enacted, Colorado voters would have to show proof of citizenship when registering for the first time, as well as every time they update their registration. The process would also have to take place in person, removing online registration as an option, and lines to vote in person would take much longer as election workers would have to verify documentation. 
Most Colorado voters already need to have their ballot to their county clerks office by 7 p.m. on Election Day to have it counted, but for military and overseas voters, their ballot can be counted up to eight days after Election Day so long as it’s postmarked on Election Day. Trump’s order would preclude ballots to be counted after Election Day.
“We believe our military voters deserve every opportunity to have their voice heard and so this executive order would walk that back, which seems insane,” Crane said. 
Belknap said the order could also hinder Colorado’s automatic voter registration process, as Division of Motor Vehicles employees would have to “assess customer citizenship status” during every interaction they have. 
“We’ve had this automatic motor registration at the DMV for many years now,”  Belknap said. “It’s how so many Coloradans get registered to vote originally when they get their permit or their drivers license, or when they move and have to update.” 
SAVE Act 
Republicans in Congress reintroduced the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act, which would require proof of citizenship for anyone registering to vote nationwide. The bill poses a more substantial threat than Trump’s executive order because Congress actually has the power to legislate certain requirements for federal elections. Spencer said the SAVE Act includes some provisions Trump tried to address with his executive order related to citizenship and voting machine verification, but it’s not quite as far reaching. 
Two Colorado Republicans in Congress, Reps. Lauren Boebert of Windsor and Jeff Crank of Colorado Springs, are sponsors of SAVE Act.
The CCCA has taken a formal position against the SAVE Act. Crane said the measure is “poorly written” and would increase costs of conducting elections without providing the funding for those costs. 
With the potential for civil or criminal charges for election workers who unintentionally register an ineligible voter in the SAVE Act, Crane said it would also deter people from working as an election judge because they wouldn’t want to risk prosecution. 
“Nobody is out there right now — no clerk, no election judge — purposefully registering somebody who shouldn’t be registered,” Crane said. “If it does happen, it’s certainly on a very, very small scale now. But if you make a mistake, you could face five years in prison and you could be sued civilly. Who in their right mind is going to want to work in that environment?”
Crane said while it is important to ensure only citizens are voting, the Trump administration is looking to do so in a way that isn’t efficient without seeking alternative means. 
“They aren’t interested in having conversations with experts who do this work to figure out those better ways,” Crane said. “They’d much rather be informed by people who have been spreading disinformation for the last four years and spreading lies and legislating based on disinformation rather than fact, and that’s a very dangerous place to be.”
López said Trump intentionally spreads misinformation — particularly the false claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen — to undermine voters and create distrust to the point that eligible voters won’t want to vote. Ultimately, López said he thinks that’s Trump’s main goal. 
“He doesn’t like who’s coming out to vote, so let’s stifle it rather than fighting a fair fight in a fair election and talking about the facts,” López said. 
Claims of widespread fraud in recent U.S. elections have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, and the courts.
López said “in the age of misinformation,” he encouraged all voters to go “straight to the source” and ask their local elections officials any questions they have about their voter registration or how their vote is counted. 
“Our voters can expect the same level of excellence from their clerk and recorder’s office, from the elections division, as they are used to — the same fair, secure and accessible model that leads the nation,” López said.

(Photo courtesy of Carol Bansley)A $1 billion cut to the U.S. Department of Agriculture is expected to remove dependable protein sources for food banks in Arkansas, where one in five people lacked access to adequate food in 2023 — the nation’s highest rate.
The cuts are also expected to slash significant earnings for local farmers who participated in the USDA’s Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program (LFPA) and the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program (LFS). The programs became effective in Arkansas in the fall of 2022 upon established USDA contracts.
Former Arkansas Department of Human Services Secretary Cindy Gillespie and current Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward both commended the program contracts at the time they were signed in USDA-issued press releases. Gillespie praised the LFPA program for its goal to bring nutritious food to Arkansas families and Ward said LFS would help strengthen the state’s multibillion- dollar agriculture industry.
When asked for a statement about the federal cuts, Ward’s chief of staff referred questions to the USDA or the Arkansas Department of Education, which distributes the funds.
During the approximate two years the programs were active, the ADE distributed nearly $9.3 million combined, which helped stock 91 schools and eight food banks or distributors with locally grown products. Four dozen farmers participated in the programs, according to the ADE.
Education Department spokesperson Kimberly Mundell said the state had about $1.8 million in  LFPA funds remaining as of April 2, and “We have not been informed of any funding cuts.”
The Northeast Arkansas Food Bank received two cycles of funding from the LFPA program, Chief Executive Officer Christie Jordan said. What remains of its latest $500,000 allocation is expected to be spent within the next few months, in line with the state’s fiscal year, she said.

“The LFPA program was a steady source of fresh protein for us to distribute to people in northeast Arkansas, [and] that’s the largest impact that losing this particular stream of funding will have on our organization” she said.
Charitable food organizations largely rely on donations, and protein is a nutritional category that often comes up short. Jordan said the NEA Food Bank sources foods it lacks in donations, which is often fresh meats, fruits and vegetables.
The NEA Food Bank serves 12 counties, but it reaches residents in all 75 through partnerships.
“This loss will be felt statewide,” Jordan said. “There are farm partnerships that will feel this impact, and the food banks will be looking to source food differently because of the loss of this.”
Jordan said the funding loss will change the composition of the food the organization can provide, but she’s still figuring out how to offset the financial loss. Despite losing the federal assistance, Jordan said she is grateful funding wasn’t cut immediately and she has a few months to plan for the next fiscal year.
“I have every confidence that we will be able to continue to provide the same volume of food, but that composition of what is offered will change,” she said.
Similarly, Northwest Arkansas Food Bank President and CEO Kent Eikenberry said he’s in somewhat of a limbo stage where he’s brainstorming what alternative funding sources he can use to cover the gap.

“We are so fortunate to [be] in a position where we are not dependent upon the federal government in order to distribute food to those people who need help,” he said. 
Eikenberry didn’t provide the exact figure the NWA Food Bank received through the LFPA program. It “wasn’t a huge amount, but it’s something that we’ll just roll into our operational expenses,” he said.
With the “bonus” federal assistance, Eikenberry said he purchased ground beef to offer a new protein option in a poultry-heavy area. Moving forward, he said he expects to continue his commitment to do whatever is necessary to serve the region.
“If I didn’t think I could come up with a solution, I wouldn’t need to be in this chair,” he said.
Farmers lose financial deals, future opportunities 
The crux of the USDA programs is that local farmers would benefit from selling their product to food banks and school districts. Nearly 50 Arkansas farmers participated, from small-scale family operations to regionally known businesses.
For Bansley’s Berkshire Ridge Farm, a family operation in Harrison, losing the LFPA funding means missing out on more than $25,000 a month, Carol Bansley said.

Since participating in the LFPA program, Bansley said she has organized monthly sales with the Northeast Arkansas Food Bank in Jonesboro and a food shelter in Conway. Combined, Bansley estimated her farm was providing 3,000 pounds of protein to the organizations, which typically would have been stored away.
“[LFPA] was very nice because it took the product that we might have had excess of,” she said. “…We just have to figure out something so we don’t get that stockpile again, which will be a true bummer. Good meats were going to a good cause. It’s unfortunate.”
Bansley’s farm also sells to restaurants in Northwest Arkansas, she said. The customers they’ve already established will keep business afloat, but the additional funds made it easier to improve farm infrastructure, Bansley said.
“We got new feed bins, we added fences and we got some more housing,” Bansley said, noting that normally only one improvement is made each year.
Bansley said the loss of funding will have a significant impact on the farm’s annual earnings, but operations will return to how they ran before the programs were established.
More than 70 miles west in Pea Ridge, Shimizu Farms operator David Welch said the loss of the opportunity to participate in the federal programs feels “terrible.”
Shimizu Farms’ hydroponic lettuce and basil farm started three years ago, and Welch said he was considering expanding to a second greenhouse, but has put those plans on pause given the news of the federal cuts.

Because the operation is set indoors, Welch can grow and provide fresh produce year-round. Currently, he averages 825 heads a lettuce weekly, which he sells to nearby food distributors. Welch didn’t sell directly to food banks that received federal funding through LFPA because of his small volume, but he was considering contracting with schools under the LFS program.
Now, he doesn’t expect to have the opportunity to do either.
“I think as a farmer, obviously, we love when our product can be out into the community, especially for some of our underrepresented groups,” Welch said. “And when we’re losing that opportunity, it definitely hurts morale. It hurts us as farmers. It hurts the underrepresented groups.”

Trickle-down effect
Organizers of food banks that don’t receive federal funds also feel  pressure from the federal cuts, presuming their dependable regional funding sources will now become more competitive. 
Project HOPE Food Bank in Hot Springs doesn’t receive federal grants to purchase the food it supplies to its 70 nonprofit partners, but assistant director Becky Chote said she expects the USDA cuts will still result in less food available to hungry families.
Project HOPE is privately funded, and Chote said state and regional grants will likely become more competitive without available federal options. With residents’ pocketbooks also bearing the impact of higher prices at the grocery store, the food bank could face fewer community donations, Chote said.
“It looks like it’s going to be a tough situation,” she said. “I hope I’m wrong, but it looks pretty tough out here.”
Without a clear sense of the implications of the federal slashing, Chote said she is left guessing what will really happen.

She said she’s unsure what will become of the existing produce giveaway at local subsidized senior housing, where short shelf-life foods like salads are distributed before they spoil. Chote doesn’t know how much of a subsidy the food bank will be able to provide to its partners if the cost of food rises. Once Project HOPE has to shell out more money for its wholesale product, the cost to distributors would likely rise as well, she said.
“That’s the really scary part about all this, is we don’t really know which way it’s going to go,” she said.
One thing Chote is pretty confident in is that she believes children and seniors will be most impacted by the changes at the federal level. 
Children in Arkansas experience hunger at a higher rate than children in all but one other state. In 2022, one in four kids faced food insecurity, according to a report from Feeding America, a national nonprofit that collaborates with food banks and other meal assistance programs. 
Chote also said she’s fearful of the negative impacts of introducing tariffs, generally.
“For kids to have the opportunity to have fresh foods is just amazing, and this is really kind of greedy,” she said. “We have about 101 different products in our food bank. You would be astonished to know how few are made here in the U.S. Any kind of tariffs are going to cause more hunger, as far as we can see.”
On April 2, Trump announced he would impose a 10% base tariff on international goods, with some countries facing higher levies. The universal tariff becomes effective on April 5.

(Helaina Thompson | Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.











A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture




“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system

	In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, speaks on the House floor on March 25, 2025. (Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The state may soon start development on a new website detailing its Legacy Fund holdings after the North Dakota Senate last week unanimously passed an investment transparency bill.
The Legacy Fund, worth more than $12 billion as of January, is a state trust fund supported by oil revenue. It was created by a ballot measure approved by voters in 2010 with the goal of being a source of perpetual revenue for the state. 
House Bill 1319, sponsored by Rep. Bernie Satrom, R-Jamestown, says the website must include all Legacy Fund “companies, funds and other financial mechanisms in which the Legacy Fund is invested,” so long as the information may be disclosed under state and federal law.
“Some people don’t care what they’re invested in,” Satrom said in February testimony on the bill before the House Finance and Taxation Committee. “To me, it matters.”
The North Dakota Retirement and Investment Office estimated the cost for the website at about $421,000, according to a fiscal note attached to the bill. It said it would cost around $27,500 annually to maintain the website.
The House in February approved the bill by a vote of 92-1.
The Retirement and Investment Office also supports the bill. Interim Executive Director Jodi Smith said that the agency already shares a wealth of information online about the fund, but a new website could make it more straightforward for members of the public to digest.

“I feel like all that language and information is on our website, but if you’ve been on our website and try to find it all, it can be a bit cumbersome,” Smith said. “It’s not easy to navigate.”
The office expects the website to save both state employees and members of the public a lot of time and effort.
Smith said that about a third of records requests filed with the Retirement and Investment Office relate to the Legacy Fund. The agency has dedicated thousands of dollars worth of staff time to fulfilling the records requests, she said. 
Getting a website up and running will take a long time, Smith said. The agency hopes to have an interface similar to one that Norway uses for its sovereign wealth fund, which allows visitors to sort all of its investments by country.
“It might take us a couple of years to get there,” she said.
The Retirement and Investment Office already discloses how much Legacy Fund money is invested in particular companies, Smith said.
However, for a portion of the money invested in commingled funds, the agency does not disclose which investments are made by specific fund managers. Smith said this would violate the agency’s contracts with those managers. About $3.1 billion of the Legacy Fund is in these commingled funds, also known as institutional funds.
“We can’t reveal a fund manager’s investment strategy,” she said.
Bismarck attorney Tory Jackson last year asked for the North Dakota Attorney General’s Office to weigh in on whether the Retirement and Investment Office violated public records laws by withholding this information.
Gov. Kelly Armstrong during his campaign for governor advocated for more transparency with Legacy Fund investments. He is now chair of the State Investment Board. Another Legacy Fund-related bill sponsored by Satrom, House Bill 1330, would instruct the State Investment Board to divest from all Chinese companies. The Senate has yet to vote on the bill.

(Stock photo by EyeEm Mobile GmbH/Getty Images Plus)LINCOLN — State lawmakers are looking to boost action by recent governors to combat suicide in Nebraska through new legislation with an extra focus on veterans and their families.
Legislative Bill 414, by State Sen. George Dungan of Lincoln, would house a new suicide mortality review team in the Nebraska Department of Veterans’ Affairs. The team would review the circumstances around any suicides in the state generally, with an extra focus on veterans with the location. Dungan called the bill a “first step” toward working to prevent future suicides and said it would “help Nebraska as a whole.”
“Having this established review team in the Department of Veterans’ Affairs would be a game changer for our veterans dealing with mental health issues and for Nebraskans struggling with mental illness across the entire state,” Dungan said last week during floor debate.

LB 414, which advanced 37-0, follows efforts from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, seeking similar reviews at the state and community level.
Former Gov. Pete Ricketts, now in the U.S. Senate, joined the “Governor’s Challenge to Prevent Suicide Among Service Members, Veterans and their Families” in 2022. Nebraska joined the suicide mortality review efforts under Gov. Jim Pillen in 2024. 
Review team responsibilities
With Pillen’s support, Nebraska leaders have met monthly for such reviews and received federal funding to help, too. Dungan’s bill would put the team into state law with additional structure.
Among the team’s duties would be developing a data collection system, conducting an annual analysis of the incidences and causes of suicides in the state during the prior fiscal year, creating protocols for such investigations, studying the adequacy of laws and training to determine possible changes to help prevent suicides and educating the public.

Upon request of the agency director, a county attorney or the Nebraska attorney general could subpoena to request relevant records.
The suicide mortality review team established by LB 414 would include:

The director or designee of the state Veterans’ Affairs Department.
A representative of the Nebraska Violent Death Reporting System.
A representative of Nebraska Local Outreach to Suicide Loss Survivors.
A representative of the Division of Behavioral Health in the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services.
An education administrator.
A hospital representative.
An emergency medical services representative.
A member of law enforcement.
A mental health professional or licensed clinical social worker.
A veteran representative.
Additional members as needed.

An annual report would be required by April 1 summarizing the data by cause of death, factors contributing to the death, age, sex, race, geographic location and date of death. The report could include recommendations to prevent additional suicides.
Mental health importance
Dungan said he has attended the monthly meetings where mental health officials, law enforcement, county attorneys and others get involved. He said the team, for example, had identified a motel with a high number of suicides happening on the property.

The motel later received a grant for staff suicide awareness and prevention training, which was successful, Dungan said. But when the funding stopped, the impact reversed.
Dungan said there is already a database for violent death reporting and that nothing in his bill would jeopardize privacy protections.
“I care about this issue a lot. Mental health and the results that come from poor mental health care and other various things are incredibly close and near and dear to us,” Dungan said at his bill’s hearing. “I just want to make sure we take this bill very seriously.”
Speaker John Arch of La Vista selected LB 414 as one of his 25 speaker priority bills for the 2025 session.
‘We all know stories’
Jenifer Acierno, legal counsel for the Nebraska Veterans’ Affairs Department, testified in favor of the bill at its March 6 hearing. She said LB 414 “provides the opportunity to coordinate the next steps in combating veteran suicide.”
The Government, Military and Veterans Affairs Committee unanimously advanced LB 414, including State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County, one of three veterans on the committee.
  State Sen. Bob Andersen of north-central Sarpy County. March 26, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)
Andersen, the committee vice chair and a 21-year veteran of the U.S. Air Force, described the issue as a “delicate dance” of ensuring privacy while making certain the suicide mortality review team gets access to all the context of the situation and how a person “got to the place where suicide was the only way out.”
He added that he knows people who have committed suicide and urged Dungan to include a veteran on the review team, who he said might have a background critical in identifying areas not readily apparent to civilians. His idea was ultimately included in an amendment that lawmakers adopted 36-0. Andersen suggested future work to identify high-risk veterans earlier to provide help.
“We’ve been in situations where we understand why they get where they get, and whatever we can do to isolate in advance and help bring them back [would help them] get on with a productive life,” Andersen said. “Kudos to you for bringing the bill.”
Dungan thanked Andersen, as well as State Sens. Dan McKeon of Amherst and Dan Lonowski of Hastings, the other two veterans on the committee, for their service. 
“Suicide is one of those things that I think affects all of us, even if it’s tangential,” Dungan said at the hearing. “We all know stories, and so I think it’s something we have to take care of sooner than later.”

To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

We are an open enrollment family, meaning that even though we don’t live in the district, we choose to send our kids to MPS because we love our public school’s mission, curriculum, and teachers. But right now, my daughter’s school is closed. Not because of a snowstorm or a spring break, but because the building is so contaminated with lead that it is undergoing emergency remediation. 
As we work to unravel how deep the lead problem goes and how we’re going to fix it, we know that two things are true: 1) the incompetence and lack of qualifications of some MPS staff has put our children in harm’s way, and 2) this is the result of decades of intentional neglect from state policymakers who starve public schools of the resources needed to keep them safe and functional. While there’s blame to go around within the school system, it extends far beyond Milwaukee—all the way to the statehouse.
But let’s take a step back for a moment: imagine a thriving community garden. Lush with fruits and veggies, it’s a vibrant hub of cooperation. Gardeners, volunteers, and neighbors work side by side, cultivating a space that nourishes the entire community. 
And now, imagine a group of lawmakers find out about this garden and see it not for what it provides to the community, but as an opportunity for political favors. They want it. But they can’t take it outright—not yet. So instead they sabotage it, slowly and methodically.
First, they put limits on water usage. Next, they dilute the fertilizer. Then, they restrict access to tools, making it harder for the gardeners to do their work. As the plants begin to wither, the weeds take over. The once-thriving garden now appears neglected and struggling, despite the community doing their best with what they’ve been given. 
Then, the lawmakers point the finger at the very people who have been desperately trying to keep the garden alive. “You’re failing.” they say. 
And with that, they present their “solution.” “This garden can’t be saved,” they declare. “It’s time to give this land to someone who can do something with it.”
So they sell the land to a private company—one that rips out the plants and paves over the garden to install a private- pay parking lot. The community is locked out, the public loses, and the private company profits. “It’s better for everyone this way,” the lawmakers insist, knowing full well who really benefits.
But they aren’t done yet. In return for their part in the heist, they collect their rewards—  campaign donations, future job offers. A shared community resource is gone, transformed into private gain.
This is what’s happening to Milwaukee Public Schools.
Most MPS parents love and appreciate so much about our own public schools for the vibrant, nurturing communities they are—and for all they could be with the right support. But for years, some lawmakers in Madison have been quietly undermining our public education system — capping resources, limiting access and restricting funding. They’ve been misrepresenting outdated formulas to intentionally starve our public schools, making it harder for teachers and administrators to provide the quality education our kids deserve. Milwaukee voters recently passed a big referendum because people in the community want to support our schools. The news about poor financial reporting that followed that successful referendum drive was extremely discouraging. But problems with school administration pale in comparison to the impossible conditions the state has created for our schools. When they inevitably struggle under those conditions (frustrating every singe one of us) the same lawmakers who have been withholding funds shake their heads and blame the administrators and educators who have been forced to do more with less.
What happens next? They argue that public schools have failed and insist that privatization is the only answer. They push to divert public funds into private hands — voucher schools, for-profit education corporations and other institutions that lack the transparency and accountability of public education, but promise big profits for those in power.
They spout platitudes about how much they care about improving education, but they have had every chance to help us nourish our gardens and have resisted at every turn. We cannot let them gaslight us into dismantling a public good for private enrichment and turning our children’s future into a business model that benefits the few at the expense of the many.
Because here’s the truth: Our public schools are not failing. They are being sabotaged. There are some powerful Madison lawmakers who are forcing our school administrators to choose between things like fixing peeling paint in classrooms or hiring a new teacher, all so they can have someone to blame– when in reality, they themselves are the ones who have failed to provide enough for our kids to thrive in all the ways they deserve. They’ve been playing us for a long con, but we’re onto them. 
We must demand true nourishment and resources for our public schools. We must reject the false narrative of “failure” that is being used to justify their destruction. And we must hold lawmakers accountable for the choices they make—because our children’s education should never be for sale.
This year, Madison lawmakers will decide how resources are allocated to our schools through the state budget process. The State Joint Finance Committee is currently holding public listening sessions on the budget. They need to hear from all of us what our kids need and deserve. We must work together to ensure our public schools– where so much of our kids’ childhoods happen– are deeply nourished for the good of us all.

Her funeral was Sunday at a church in Seminole followed by a private burial.
U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited the West Texas town that has been the epicenter of the outbreak Sunday and was expected to meet with the family.
“My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,” Kennedy wrote on social media. He went on to describe the resources he deployed to Texas in March after another school-aged child died from measles, claiming that the “growth rates for new cases and hospitalizations have flattened” since Kennedy sent a team from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state reported 59 new cases in three days last week.
The child who died Thursday, Daisy Hildebrand, was not vaccinated and had no known underlying health conditions, said a spokesperson for University Medical Center in Lubbock, where she had been hospitalized. She died from “measles pulmonary failure,” the Texas Department of State Health Services reported Sunday.
“This unfortunate event underscores the importance of vaccination,” Vice President of University Medical Center Aaron Davis said in a statement. “We encourage all individuals to stay current with their vaccinations to help protect themselves and the broader community.”

The death comes about five weeks after unvaccinated 6-year-old Kayley Fehr died from measles, the first such death in the country in a decade. Fehr’s parents said that their stance on vaccination did not change after their daughter’s death.
The West Texas outbreak has sickened 481 people, most of whom are unvaccinated children, according to the state health department.
The outbreak began in Gaines County, located about 90 minutes southwest of Lubbock on the New Mexico border. Since then, cases have been reported in 18 other Texas counties, as far east as Erath County in central Texas.
The CDC has linked the Texas outbreak with measles cases in Oklahoma and New Mexico, where an unvaccinated individual who tested positive for measles died in March. And the World Health Organization reported that cases in Mexico were linked to Texas.
NM reports six more measles cases

Measles is a highly contagious virus that spreads through respiratory droplets passed through the air by breathing, coughing and sneezing. Vaccination is the safest way to build immunity to the virus. Two doses of MMR vaccine are about 97% effective at preventing measles; one dose is about 93% effective, according to the CDC.
Measles was officially eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 following a highly successful vaccination program. But vaccine skeptics, fueled by misinformation and a disdain for COVID-era mandates, have sown distrust of public health and contributed to declining rates of vaccination. In Gaines County, 82% of kindergarteners are up to date on their MMR vaccine. Experts say communities need a 95% threshold to prevent the spread of measles.
A CDC spokesperson said in an email that Kennedy’s visit to Texas on Sunday resulted in discussions with Texas state health officials to deploy a second CDC response team to West Texas to further assist with the state’s efforts to protect its residents against measles and its complications.
Dr. Manisha Patel, incident manager for the CDC, said their team arrived in Gaines County in March and left on April 1. A spokesperson for the CDC said in light of today’s news and Kennedy’s order to re-deploy, another team will be in the county.
“We’re learning a lot in Gaines County on how we can help other jurisdictions also prepare for measles in their states,” Patel said.
Patel said it’s important to go in with a sensitive approach when it comes to small, close-knit communities that are unvaccinated.

However, she said there are three pieces to their measles control measures: the vaccine, not traveling if you’re exposed, and staying at home.
“MMR is the best way to protect yourself, your families, your communities against measles,” Patel said. “And, if you’re starting to get very sick from measles, not to delay care.”
Patel said for some communities, it’s important to find trusted messengers. In some cases, she said, the federal government might not be the best choice for that and it has to be someone in the community. To work around this, Patel said they’ve worked directly with state and local health departments to find who the trusted messengers are.
“Our role is making sure those trusted messengers have the materials and information they need,” Patel said. “So we translate, for example, materials into a German or Spanish or whatever the community needs.”

State health officials have said that the outbreak could persist for months. It has spread most quickly in pockets of Texas with below-average vaccination rates. In Gaines County, where a large unvaccinated Mennonite community resides, 315 people have been infected.
People infected with measles usually experience symptoms within a week or two of exposure. Early symptoms include high fever, runny nose and watery eyes. A few days later, a rash breaks out on the face and then spreads down the neck to the rest of the body. Infected individuals are contagious about four days before the rash appears and up to four days after, according to state health officials.
Doctors typically recommend all children get two doses of the MMR vaccine, starting with the first dose at 12 through 15 months and the second dose at 4 through 6 years of age.
Parents of infants aged 6 to 11 months living in outbreak areas should consult their pediatrician about getting the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine, Sara Safarzadeh Amiri, chief medical officer for Odessa Regional Medical Center and Scenic Mountain Medical Center, said on Sunday.
Amiri said she was unaware of the second reported death but that it is not unexpected given the continued spread of the outbreak.
So far, 56 measles patients in Texas have been hospitalized, according to state health officials.

From gutting the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to eliminating funding for local food programs, these policies threaten the nutrition and well-being of people in need. 
In early March, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) terminated $1 billion for programs that help food banks and schools purchase food from local farms, a move that disappointed food and agriculture advocates and drew sharp criticism from 31 U.S. Senators. Soon after, USDA cancelled millions of dollars in funding for food deliveries to food banks. The 29 million children who eat school lunch and 50 million people receiving charitable food assistance—two vulnerable groups in society—will lose access to fresh produce when grocery prices are already sky high.  
The USDA’s Local Food Purchasing Assistance (LFPA) and Local Food for Schools (LFS) Cooperative Agreement Programs help supply fresh food from local producers to feeding institutions like food banks and to schools and childcare facilities, respectively. These programs are a triple win for beneficiaries, the farmers and ranchers in over 40 states, and local economies. 
LFPA alone has generated over $1.5 billion of local economic activity since the program began in December 2021. And the loss of LFS is devastating to schools, whose meal programs were already struggling with rising food costs.

In Louisiana, advocates have witnessed the benefits of LFPA and LFS on community health and the economy as they have seen farmers expanding vegetable production every year and cattle farmers selling local beef to the school systems. The loss to the state is immense, resulting in less healthy food and less local purchasing power for schools and food banks.  
In West Virginia, the state was set to receive over $2 million in LFPA funds, with 90% of the food producers classified as underserved. “This is not a handout, but a critical market opportunity for farmers,” said Spencer Moss, executive director of West Virginia Food and Farm Coalition. “Just as we’re finally seeing meaningful progress, the support is being withdrawn. This isn’t about any single farm or food bank; it’s about supporting rural communities and investing in their future.” 
 Meanwhile, SNAP, the nation’s first line of defense against hunger, is also on the chopping block. SNAP promotes health, lowers healthcare costs, and serves as an economic stabilizer during recessions, and 40% of program participants are children. Yet the latest budget resolution proposed by House Republicans in Washington would cut at least $230 billion from agriculture programs over the next decade, the lion’s share of which will be taken from SNAP. 
Anti-hunger and public health advocates have long called for increased SNAP funding, and USDA’s own study found that over half of SNAP participants found it difficult to eat healthily because of the lack of affordable foods. This drastic budget cut would worsen food security and increase health care costs over time. Taking food away from children and families to fund a tax break for the wealthy, the prime object of the benefit reductions, is immoral.  
In the name of promoting health, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services secretary has pushed for banning soda purchases with SNAP benefits, a position supported by the USDA. National and state efforts have increasingly aimed to prevent participants from purchasing these items with at least 10 state bills focused on SNAP restrictions introduced this year. 
However, there is little evidence showing that removing soda from the program does much to improve diet quality for SNAP participants. And when asked about ways to make the program healthier, people with low incomes, including SNAP users, consistently placed this low on this list. Furthermore, restricting SNAP purchases does nothing to address the root causes of food insecurity — adverse economic conditions and racial inequities. 
The Trump administration wants to slash SNAP benefits, take healthy food away from students, and weaken rural economies to pad the pockets of billionaires. These actions do not promote health and instead inflict hardships on people with low incomes. It’s high time for the administration to align its alleged commitment to health by restoring and expanding funds to these crucial programs.

(Scott Olson/Getty Images)As a mother and a rural family physician who provides obstetrics and gynecological care in Idaho, I see everyday how severe legal restrictions work to prevent safe medical treatment and instead result in unnecessarily dangerous pregnancy care. 
Last week, to mark the end of Women’s History Month, I traveled to Washington, D.C., to meet with members of Congress in the Democratic Women’s Caucus to speak out against the many attacks we are seeing nationwide and the consequences of abortion bans on patients in Idaho and across the country in this post Roe world. 
For example, St. Luke’s Health System — the largest medical provider in Idaho — bravely took up the challenge to Idaho’s near-total abortion ban last month because the Trump administration’s Department of Justice dropped the previous administration’s defense of EMTALA, the federal law requiring hospitals that receive Medicare funds to provide stabilizing emergency care — including abortion. 
An Idaho federal judge issued a temporary restraining order that allows only St. Luke’s physicians to stabilize patients with abortion care, when necessary, rather than follow Idaho’s near-total abortion ban. 
A health system is fighting Idaho’s abortion ban. It’s not its first controversial stance.

This means that whether or not patients can receive life-saving emergency care in Idaho depends on which ER they choose. Every other hospital and provider in Idaho will once again be forced to airlift patients out of state or wait until a patient’s condition becomes a situation in which termination will prevent death before they can intervene to provide the necessary care. 
Abortion bans are killing women, and instead of taking steps to protect access to lifesaving medical care, Trump and Republican extremists are working behind-the-scenes to roll back the rights of millions of American women and doctors even further. 
My life’s work is about ensuring the wellbeing of all my patients by providing the best possible medical care I can, and making sure that every decision I make will help give them a long and happy future. 
When I was living in a small town in Western Colorado teaching high school, I became drawn to the idea of becoming a rural family practice physician as I got to know some of the families that lived there and the family doctors that cared for them. The concept of providing “birth to death” care, and getting to know a family’s story at a deeper level across the generations was inspirational to me. 
Idaho is a wonderful state filled with amazing families that I have had the pleasure of providing care and support to. However, extreme politicians jeopardize the ability of medical practitioners like myself to provide care especially during cases of an emergency where a patient’s life is at stake. 
As a physician, I can tell you that delaying care for a patient with a medical emergency is extremely dangerous and can lead to serious complications. Medical emergencies must be addressed immediately and comprehensively. 
With the current abortion bans in place, doctors outside of the St. Luke’s system may be prevented from providing the medical standard of care for a pregnant patient who is hemorrhaging until their health deteriorates enough to provide treatment to prevent her death. 
I will not remain on the sidelines in this moment. I choose instead to speak out against efforts to restrict the freedom of families to make decisions about their lives and futures. Medical decisions should be taking place as a protected conversation between patients and their doctor, without government intrusion. 
The vast majority of Americans support reproductive freedom and abortion access. Polling shows that 61% of Americans disagree with the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, and a majority of Americans (8 in 10) say that the decision to have an abortion should be between the pregnant person and their doctor. 
As I reflect on what Women’s History Month means to me, I am inspired by leaders like Eleanor Roosevelt, who used her position as first lady to push for progressive legislation and to speak up for women and other marginalized communities of her time. 
She once said, “the world of the future is in our making. Tomorrow is now.” 
If we are going to protect women and patients impacted by the abortion bans sweeping the nation, we must ensure that doctors, and all health care providers have the necessary tools and resources to save every life they can. When families and patients go into the emergency room, they should never be told that medical standards of care are illegal. 
It’s been the honor of a lifetime to dedicate my livelihood to providing care to my patients. I will continue to be an advocate for reproductive freedom because I am passionate about carrying out my oath to my patients. I hope that the mark I leave on history is that I not only fought for my patients in the exam room, but also in the Statehouse, the courthouse and the public square.

(Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)U.S. Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee’s 2nd Congressional District clearly doesn’t like or do town hall meetings.
He did one in 2019 during his first year in Congress in Grainger County. Rutledge, the county seat, has a population of 1,331 while all of Grainger County is 24,681.
Burchett shows up at well-controlled and politically safe events and photo opportunities in parts of his district like Lenoir City, Maryville or Maynardville. He also can be found in front of the cameras of right-wing cable TV chat shows, or failing to answer questions on CNN.
He tends to avoid the city of Knoxville — with a population of 198,162, the center of his district  — where people have had the temerity to challenge his notions, and have been known to vote for his Democratic Party challengers. He also routinely ducks debates with those challengers, failing to do so in 2020, 2022, and 2024.
So, it wasn’t surprising that Burchett, along with Tennessee’s U. S. Senators Marsha Blackburn and Bill Hagerty — all three were invited — skipped the recent Congressional Recess Town Hall on the evening of March 21 at the Deane Hill Recreation Center in suburban Knoxville.  Burchett sent an email declining to attend.  One moderator, Steve Dupree, said, “I’ve known Tim for a long time; and I’m not surprised.  We effectively do not have representation in this district.”
Two local politicians — state Reps. Sam McKenzie and Gloria Johnson, both Democrats — did show up for the event sponsored by progressive groups Indivisible Knoxville and Moms Demand Action, and handled the question-and-answer section.
The event drew more than 300 people.  Speakers included labor leaders and other local people invited to speak to the audience about how cuts from President Donald Trump and his top campaign contributor, unelected interloper Elon Musk, had already or soon would harm them.  Signs dotted the enthusiastic crowd.  One read, “Burchett is MIA.”  Another read, “Fire Musk. Not Veterans.” My favorite was one saying, “Keep your grubbing hands off our Social Security.”
In Nashville, U.S. Sen. Elizabeth Warren fires up crowd with Trump, Musk criticism 

Town halls recently have gone embarrassingly wrong for congressional Republicans.  Constituents are furious at Trump and Musk. It turns out that false promises of reduced prices are almost as unpopular as pardoning insurrectionists, cutting needed public health programs, laying off veterans, abandoning global allies, and threatening Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.
That likely is why Richard Hudson, the chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee, recently said GOP congressmen should hide behind choices like livestreamed events or virtual town halls. The explicit message was to avoid open in-person town halls; the implicit message was “we’re not really interested in changing our policies or listening to these constituents, so put on a well-controlled show.”
U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson echoed the approach.  He said, “You can do it in telephone town halls. You can have small subgroups of people from different industries and segments of the community. We find that to be very, very productive, and more productive than if you just go to an open forum right now. Why? Because we’ve seen this movie before. George Soros-funded groups and others literally pay protesters.”
Burchett opined, “I think they just urged us to be more targeted and where’s, who we’re talking to, because it’s pretty clear that they’ve got professional instigators, people that are showing up that are not even constituents.”
Perhaps Rep. David Kustoff, a Republican representing the 8th District, was excessively worried about a planned sign waving protest by the Germantown Democratic Club. His schedule event in late March at Our Lady of Perpetual Help was cancelled due to alleged security concerns. The same night an empty chair stood in for 7th District Rep. Mark Green at a town hall meeting in Clarksville.
First District Rep. Diana Harshbarger had a public meeting on February 28th that didn’t go well. The audience disputed her claims and scoffed at her recitation of Trump talking points. At one point a woman was kicked out for repeatedly asking her a question she didn’t answer about persons who are born intersex.
Protestors have been urging the 3rd District’s Chuck Fleischmann to hold a public meeting  Reps. Scott Desjarlais and Andy Ogles, 4th and 5th  Districts respectively, have not held a recent town hall, while the 6th District’s John Rose has been too busy putting together a gubernatorial campaign.
The only Democrat in Tennessee’s congressional delegation, Steve Cohen of the 9th District in Memphis, held a town hall and he tallied 750 people showing up for a thorough and respectful discussion.
I found nothing but constituents (and no paid agitators) at the Deane Hill Rec Center Town Hall, but I am still perturbed that my congressman, Burchett, responds to his constituents with an amateurish dodge. In one recent social media post, Burchett wrote, “We got a lot of work to do. Pray for your country, and dadgummit hold us accountable. Don’t let us start making stupid excuses.”
Dadgummit, Tim, we’re trying. Show up for the town halls and the debates.

Medicaid is a lifeline for West Virginia families, seniors, people with disabilities, low-income adults and children. Today, nearly one in three West Virginians rely on Medicaid for their health care. Cuts to the program would mean fewer doctor visits, fewer life-saving prescriptions, and more families forced to choose between paying rent and affording care. For providers, it would mean more uncompensated care, lower reimbursements, job losses and potentially even closures of medical centers.  
We know what happens when funding is cut. Hospitals, especially in rural areas, suffer financially. People go without care, and preventable conditions turn into medical crises. Mental health coverage and substance use treatment, care that was inaccessible to many West Virginians without Medicaid, will become harder to reach. Hospitals and providers, already operating on thin margins, will be at greater risk of closing their doors. That’s why West Virginians are speaking out, urging Sens. Shelley Moore Capito and Jim Justice, as well as Reps. Carol Miller and Riley Moore, to reject any federal budget cuts to Medicaid. 
Just as HB 3518 could have ended health coverage for 166,000 people, but was described in committee as a bill that “did nothing” unless Congress took action, West Virginians must be on alert for Medicaid cuts disguised as harmless or “cutting waste,” but that have real consequences and shift costs onto states and families. 
Work reporting requirements, reductions to federal matching rates, and other changes that impact Medicaid financing mechanisms all shift Medicaid costs onto the state budget, where state lawmakers have warned they will not fill the gap. If these changes are enacted, the loss of Medicaid funding will result in cuts to enrollment, fewer services covered, reduced reimbursements to providers, or some combination of the three. 
West Virginians can’t afford state or federal cuts to Medicaid. We need our congressional delegation to fight for a budget that prioritizes people — not the interests of the wealthy few. If they truly represent the interests of their constituents, they will protect Medicaid and ensure that every West Virginian, regardless of income, has access to the health care they need.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)Political pandering: the act of expressing one’s views in accordance with the likes of a group to which one is attempting to appeal for the purpose of drawing support up to and including votes and do not necessarily reflect one’s personal values.
Absurd! And yet, this political pandering is becoming a core issue on the federal, state and local terrains. As such, it comes very close — too close — to preventing any real, definitive action in enacting legislation that would result in anything of real value. And knowing of the deep-seated trend makes us question the validity of the actions of our legislative leaders. Do they have our best interests at heart, or do they have their best interests at heart — i.e., what propels their own political aspirations? 
We don’t have to dig too deep to find examples of politicians not only tweaking their positions but making complete turnarounds. Politicians have always been careful in their positions of where they stand, depending on the audience, but in recent years, their blatant disregard for standing firm on conviction/principle has produced a level of distrust, evidenced in the vast number of voters who simply didn’t show up to vote in the last presidential election. And while the good-ole-boy political system exists — to some level — throughout the country, it has always been most deeply ingrained in West Virginia. And its resultant damages are crystal clear to even those who would deny it.
A few months ago, in a commentary published in West Virginia Watch, I focused on my — at times — challenging journey as a West Virginia writer. It was humbling and gratifying when the piece was picked up by a few other respected news outlets. At its core, the piece was a wake-up call to West Virginia to leave behind the antiquated ways of doing business that clearly no longer work. 
In response to that piece, I received a letter from a well-respected, critically acclaimed, award-winning West Virginia author lauding my efforts to bring to light what is essential for West Virginia’s growth. The author spoke to “the isolation, the vacuum, in which we, as creatives, work and how that environment is often at the will of others who are motivated by complex agendas and often a lot of defensiveness.” The letter made its way into a look at Charlotte Pritt’s unsuccessful run for governor, pointing out “the dark shadows which then, and I expect now, underlie West Virginia politics and culture.”
And here we are, decades later, the alarm on the clock resounding loud and clear. Are you listening, or are you simply going to keep hitting the snooze button? When will we say, “Enough!” When will we don the badge of courage, take a deep breath, and forge a new path that most assuredly will lead us to a route void of political pandering—or at the very least crumble its much too-solid core?

And in many counties, vaccination rates among the youngest school-aged children are below 95%, the target for herd immunity.","Boxes and vials of the Measles, Mumps, Rubella Virus Vaccine at a vaccine clinic put on by Lubbock Public Health Department on March 1, 2025 in Lubbock, Texas.(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)In late March, a four-year-old in Erie County was diagnosed with measles, a highly contagious and incurable disease that, in rare cases, can cause brain damage and death. 
The child, who the county did not identify to the Capital-Star, had attended day care at Creative Learning Childcare in Erie, where 160 kids were enrolled, while likely infected. According to County Executive Brenton Davis, some children under one-years-old, the age when children typically receive their measles vaccination, may have been exposed.
It was the third diagnosed case in Erie County this year, which had not had a single, documented one since 1991. And it was the sixth case in Pennsylvania. There has been one confirmed case each in Bucks, Montgomery and Philadelphia  counties as well.
Currently, the U.S. is experiencing one of its largest measles outbreaks in decades, largely due to a cluster of cases among a Texas Mennonite community. There have been more than 600 cases across the country in 2025 alone, the most cases on record since 2019 — and it’s only April. Three people have died, two of them children.
The resurgence of the disease, which the World Health Organization declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, is largely due to declining vaccination rates. Because it is so contagious, experts say it takes a 95% vaccination rate for herd immunity to be established, despite the measles vaccine being one of the most effective ever produced.

In Pennsylvania, measles vaccination rates among children are on the decline. And in many counties, vaccination rates among the youngest school-aged children are below 95%, the target for herd immunity, according to the most recent available Dept. of Health data from the 2023-2024 school year. Only 23 of the 67 counties had a vaccination rate at or over that level among kindergarten students. Measles vaccination rates among kindergarteners were measured as low as 84% in Cameron County.
“In Pennsylvania itself, when we take a look at childhood immunizations for measles, we’re somewhere around 93% and 94% statewide, which isn’t bad, but it isn’t what’s considered herd immunity,” said Dr. Jeffrey Jahre, an infectious disease specialist at St. Luke’s University Hospital in Bethlehem. He was referring to the rate among kindergarten students. “But what’s particularly important is we know that [vaccination rates] can vary dramatically from one community to another, and from one county to another.”
According to the Centers for Disease Control, roughly one in five unvaccinated people who catch measles will be hospitalized. One in 1000 infected children will develop encephalitis, an infection that causes inflammation of the brain. And roughly one to three in 1,000 children will die. 
“People now have forgotten about how bad it can really be,” Jahre said. “One of the things that becomes very, very evident when you look at the cases that have occurred in the United States is that nearly all have been in unvaccinated people.”
This year, 97% of cases in the U.S. have been in unvaccinated people or people with unknown vaccination status.
In a statement, Mark O’Neill, a state Department of Health spokesman, said, “There is no immediate risk to the general public at this time, as the latest school immunization report (2023-2024) shows that 97% of 12th grade students, 95.7% of 7th grade students, and 94% of kindergarten students in Pennsylvania are vaccinated against the measles virus.” 
“Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect against measles, and residents can request a vaccine from their health care provider,” he added.
Where is the risk and what can you do?
So far, there has yet to be a confirmed measles case in any of Pennsylvania’s highest-risk counties, based on vaccination rates. Those include Cameron County, which has an 84.2% MMR vaccination rate among kindergarten students, but 100% in both 7th and 12th grade; and Pike County, which has an 86.8% vaccination rate among kindergarteners, a 92.7% rate among 7th graders and a 95.7% rate among 12th graders.
But even in a community at or near the herd immunity target of 95% vaccination, a single case can be disruptive.

Take the latest case in Erie County, for example. The county has a 94.9% vaccination rate among kindergarteners, and was above the 95% target among 7th and 12th graders. But the one case in an unvaccinated child led to potential exposures at a gym, Fitness U; a walk-in clinic, UPMC Children’s Express; as well as Creative Learning Childcare, which was attended by children under the age of one who are typically not yet vaccinated. 
Davis, the Erie county executive, said unvaccinated people who may have been exposed were asked to quarantine. And because the disease can go undetected in infected people for over a week, children under the age of one, and anyone unvaccinated, are being asked to stay away from Creative Learning Childcare.
“There could be the potential for the community to have a very large struggle, not just having the measles, but quarantining,” Davis said.  “We know how disruptive that can be to a work schedule, particularly for people who can’t afford childcare.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Erie County has an advantage of being one of seven counties to have its own health department, and another four have municipal health departments. Nearly half of Pennsylvania’s population lives in these areas, and each of the counties had a measles vaccination rate above 94% in kindergarten students. 
Davis said the health department “ makes us more nimble.” The case was diagnosed on a Sunday, and they were still able to have roughly 20 staff working on contact tracing and other response tasks that day.
Measles symptoms include a high fever, cough, rash, red watery eyes and a runny nose.
“Obviously, we are preparing for the potential of something larger,” Davis said.  “There’s not a major panic, it’s just more or less trying to get ahead of any event.”
The case in Erie County is a reminder that highly vaccinated counties can still experience measles outbreaks.
“We kind of break [vaccination rates] down county by county, but we see people travel across counties all the time,” said Dr. Patrick Gavigan, an infectious disease expert at Penn State Health in Hershey. “People are so connected, so it’s easy for cases to spread.”
Dauphin County, where Gavigan works, only has an 88.9% Measles, Mumps and Rubella (MMR) vaccination rate among kindergarten students, a 92.5% rate among 7th grade students, and a 95% rate among 12th graders. 
It’s one of 8 counties with a kindergarten measles vaccination rate below 90%, and one of 45 with a rate below the 95% herd immunity target.
Pennsylvania also has seven counties where 7th grade MMR vaccination rates are below 90% and 25 below 95%. Among 12th graders, only one county, Tioga, had a vaccination rate below 90%. 


“The lower that number gets, the higher the risk for outbreaks and spread,” Gavigan said. Though Gavigan cautioned that grade-wide measurements are not necessarily indicative of community vaccination rates, which are the most important factors.
Still, Gavigan says that most parents, even in such areas, shouldn’t be worried about their children. “They can get their children vaccinated and feel very comfortable that they’re going to prevent infection and serious disease,” he said.
But his concern lies with the parents of infants, and for people who are immunocompromised. Cancer patients, for example, often have their immune systems weakened by chemotherapy and other treatments, and can be prone to infection even if they’ve been vaccinated.

Gavigan said parents of infants in areas with low measles vaccination rates can consider vaccinating their children as young as six-months old. While the recommended age to vaccinate children is one, there is no harm in vaccinating a child early. However, antibodies passed down from a vaccinated mother may still exist in the child, which could potentially make the vaccine less effective. But, Gavigan cautioned, no one should make that division without consulting with their pediatrician.
“Herd immunity is so important to the 3 to 5% of kids who don’t respond to the measles vaccine, and to that group that is not able to get vaccinated or is immunosuppressed,” Gavigan said. “It’s one of the most effective vaccines we have.”
“We’ve created this situation”
There is no cure for measles. And the only effective way to prevent the disease is with a vaccine. However, measles vaccination rates have been declining for several years, both in Pennsylvania and the U.S. more broadly.
“In some ways, low vaccination rates are almost a product of the success of vaccines, because no one sees measles,” Gavigan said. “So the need for vaccines becomes less apparent to most people. There’s also been more spread of misinformation surrounding vaccines. And then I think the COVID pandemic itself disrupted a lot of regular medical visits.”
Dr. Jahre attributed the drop in vaccination rates among children to the politicization of vaccines.
“We’ve created this situation,” Jahre said. “COVID was one of the first situations where health information and vaccinations became a political football, and it still is to this day.”
But Jahre said the U.S. Health agencies and officials who led the COVID-19 pandemic response are not blameless.
“There was a lot of information that was put out that was said to be absolute when it shouldn’t have been,” Jahre said. “There was a failure, in some cases, to admit what wasn’t known, and an effort to make things sound like one-size-fits-all. When you do that, and you have this discordance, people end up saying, ‘I don’t know what to believe.’”
Jahre pointed to a string of high-profile communication failures during the pandemic. That included conflicting statements about the effectiveness of masking in preventing COVID-19, and overstatements of the effectiveness of the mRNA vaccines in preventing the disease.
On the flip side, Jahre said, the current U.S. Secretary of Health, Robert F. Kennedy, a long-time leader in the anti-vaccine movement, has overemphasized the risks of vaccinations, and has a history of amplifying misinformation and casting doubt on their effectiveness.
“Recently he did come out and say that your best bet to prevent measles is to get the vaccine, Jahre said. “But he needs to say it loudly, clearly, repetitively, and try to mitigate some of the information that he gave before, which in a lot of cases, was just provocative and not necessarily true.”

Kennedy has downplayed the severity of the ongoing measles outbreak and has advocated for unproven and sometimes dangerous treatments. While he has encouraged people to get the MMR vaccine, in an interview on Fox News, Kennedy falsely suggested the vaccine does not provide lifetime immunity and warned it “causes all the illnesses that measles itself causes.”
The measles vaccine is between 95% and 97% effective, and vaccinated people who do catch the disease, are far less likely to develop complications. While there have been rare cases of febrile seizures linked to the MMR vaccine, they are unlikely to cause long-term health impacts and there is a far lower risk of complication from the vaccine than the disease itself. There have been no deaths in healthy children linked to properly administered MMR vaccines, according to the Infectious Disease Society of America, a collective of 13,000 doctors and infectious disease experts. 
Children who develop measles have a far greater risk of serious complications, and face a one to three in 1,000 chance of dying.
In Pennsylvania, the statewide rate of MMR vaccination among kindergarteners dipped below the 95% herd immunity threshold in the 2022-2023 school year, dropping to 94%.That was down from 95.1% the previous year, and from over 96% in the 2019-2020 school year, when the COVID pandemic broke out.
While most states allow for religious exemptions to vaccine requirements, Pennsylvania is one of 15 that also allows parents to reject vaccines on philosophical or personal grounds. And the rate at which children are claiming those objections has risen. 
In the 2020-2021 school year, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, 1.2% of kindergarten students claimed a philosophical exemption to vaccine requirements and 1.2% claimed a religious one. In the 2022-2023 school year those numbers rose to 1.5% and 2.2%, respectively. In 2023, it was 1.8% and 2%.
Jahre believes the law should be changed to get rid of the philosophical exemption.
“We support individual rights,” Jahre said. “But when individual rights may infringe on others and create harm, that’s where we draw the line.”
He compared this to laws requiring car inspections. “It’s not just a question of, if your breaks are bad, that you put yourself in harm’s way. But obviously, you can then put others in harm’s way. The same is true with certain infectious diseases, measles being one of those.”
33% of 483 confirmed measles cases in the country, as of March 27, were among children under 5-years-old. Another 42% were among children between 5 and 19-years-old, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control.
A quarter of infected children under 5 — 40 out of 157 in total — were hospitalized, and that accounts for half of all measles hospitalizations in the country this year.
“It’s frustrating and discouraging, especially with something like measles, where we could have effectively prevented it in the U.S.” Gavigan said about the recent cases. “We have something available that is extremely effective and extremely safe. And, as opposed to COVID where it was this new vaccine, we’ve got years and decades of data to support the effectiveness of this measles vaccine.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/measles-vaccine-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 06:02:04.433083

(Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images)Federal inspectors conducted more than 300 safety inspections at coal mines in Harlan County over a recent 14 month-period, checking that toxic gases were ventilated, flammable materials under control and equipment working safely. Such inspections could become less frequent if the Trump administration carries out a plan to terminate the leases of dozens of mine safety field offices, warn advocates for miners.
The inspectors conducting those hundreds of inspections in Harlan County traveled from offices in Barbourville and Harlan, both of which are on a list of seven in Kentucky slated for closure by the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). That’s according to an analysis of federal Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) data by the nonprofit Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center.
Closing those offices, the analysis says, could turn a 30-minute drive to inspect a rural coal mine into a three- or four-hour round trip.
“We are really worried that any kind of cutting to field office capacity or requiring longer commutes of these inspectors just means that they’re spending less time at the mines,” said Rebecca Shelton, the center’s director of policy.
Especially worrying, Shelton said, is the possibility that inspectors would no longer have time to conduct inspections that are classified as discretionary but are “critical” to worker safety in one of the country’s most hazardous occupations. She said discretionary inspections can be made in response to complaints from miners to the agency about mine hazards or when an inspector decides a follow-up visit is needed after noticing an issue. Some inspections are required by federal law.

News outlets first reported last month that DOGE had listed the leases of dozens of MSHA field offices across the country among numerous “lease cancellations” for federal agencies. The lease terminations are part of cost-cutting efforts to eliminate waste, fraud and abuse, according to Trump officials and Trump adviser Elon Musk who’s played a leading role at DOGE.
If the government cancels the leases on the list, MSHA would be left with Kentucky offices in Lexington and Pikeville.
A spokesperson for MSHA did not directly answer questions from the Lantern about the status of MSHA offices that were on the DOGE list or if and when the offices’ leases would be terminated. 
“Mine Safety and Health Administration inspectors continue to conduct legally required inspections and remain focused on MSHA’s core mission to prevent death, illness, and injury from mining and promote safe and healthful workplaces for U.S. miners,” a U.S. Department of Labor spokesperson said in a statement. 
The Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, based in Whitesburg, compiled and analyzed data from the federal Mine Data Retrieval System on the number of inspections conducted and cumulative hours worked by inspectors at each of the 33 MSHA field offices designated for lease cancellation by DOGE. The analysis looked at the first two months of this year and all of 2024. Offices slated to have their leases terminated stretch across the country and are concentrated in Appalachia and the Ohio Valley. 
While thousands of coal-mining jobs have been lost in recent decades, MSHA inspectors remain busy, the analysis found. Out of the 33 MSHA field offices listed by DOGE, 16,639 inspections were conducted accounting for more than “234,000 hours on site at mines and over 399,000 total hours completing inspection duties.” 
Willie Dodson, the coal impacts program manager for the environmental advocacy nonprofit Appalachian Voices, told the Lantern last month that MSHA operates under a legal and regulatory framework that came from “massive grassroots movements” in the 1960s and 1970s to address dangerous working conditions in mines. Congress created MSHA as part of the Mine Safety Act of 1977 after the deaths of 26 miners in two underground explosions at the Scotia Mine in Letcher County the year before.
The rate of mining fatalities and injuries has plummeted since MSHA was established in 1977, Dodson said.
Dodson said new regulatory obligations being taken on by MSHA to monitor and control silica dust in mines that’s contributing to a surge in cases of the occupational disease coal workers’ pneumoconiosis — commonly known as “black lung” — is coinciding with a decline in staffing at MSHA over the past decade. Shelton also pointed to the firing of federal researchers who were studying “black lung” as another safeguard for miners that is “on the chopping block.” 
Adding the potential termination of field office leases to the mix makes Dodson say “the math doesn’t work out” for regulating active mines.
“I am very concerned that certain inspections just aren’t going to happen, or inspectors are going to be so rushed that they’re going to miss things that they need to take note of,” Dodson said.

“She’s like, ‘They’re preparing. They’re building bomb shelters,’” Smekodub said. “I’m like, ‘Your sister is off her rocker. She’s nuts. This is never gonna happen.’”
This was back three years ago, but she remembers the conversation vividly. Not because her sister-in-law said something crazy, but because she was right.
War was coming.
On Feb. 24, 2022, Russia launched a full invasion of Ukraine.
“It was unbelievable,” Smekdub said. “It’s still unbelievable.”
Smekodub, who moved to the United States from Ukraine when she was nine, is married to a Russian, Alexii Chankov, who immigrated to America from Moscow when he was 20. The two met in New York and recently settled in Gouldsboro, in Wayne County.
Despite coming from two countries at war, there is no tension between the two over the conflict. They consider themselves Americans now.
Three years later, Pennsylvanians with connections to Ukraine feel a mix of emotions as the war has dragged on and the Trump administration has taken office.

Pennsylvania has the second-largest population of Ukrainians and Ukrainian Americans in the country with more than 150,000 people living in the state. Schuylkill County in the northeastern part of the state is the bedrock – with four of the top 10 communities in the country with Ukrainian roots.
Starting in the late 1800s many immigrants from Eastern Europe, including from the region that would later become Ukraine, moved to the northeast part of Pennsylvania, seeking work in the anthracite coal mines. The immigrants set up a strong presence in the region, establishing Ukrainian churches and cultural centers. Throughout the next century, the area continued to attract more Ukrainian immigrants during both World Wars and the country’s fight for independence at the end of the Cold War.
While many who spoke with the Pennsylvania Capital-Star said they are holding onto hope that there will be a resolution, most do not see the current peace talks working out. Some also said they have experienced more negative remarks about their native country since Trump returned to the White House.
But none of them has lost hope that Ukraine will win.
Shifting Stances
For Alex Groysman, one moment is stuck in his mind as the point when everything changed.
CNN’s Matthew Chance was standing on top of a building in Kyiv, as explosions could be heard in the background. Then, he ducked down to put on a helmet and vest.
There it was on his television. Russian forces on Ukrainian soil.
Groysman moved to the United States from Kyiv around the time the Soviet Union fell in 1991. He was 10.
“We were hoping that there’s no way this is going to happen,” Groysman said. “There’s no way they’re gonna start bombing my home city, the capital.”
Now living in Scranton, he started a fundraiser, Scranton 4 Ukraine, in the months after the invasion, to help raise money for humanitarian causes in Ukraine. Groysman said the 5K race – held in August – has seen a decline in participation since its inauguration. But this year, he is anticipating an increase in numbers with the current state of political and international affairs.

Over the past two months, the Trump administration has spoken with both Ukraine and Russia separately trying to fulfill one of President Donald Trump’s campaign promises – to end the war.
Amid the early chaos of Trump’s second tenure, the war has taken center stage at times, with administration leaders travelling to Saudi Arabia to meet with Russian officials without Kyiv. In late February, the relationship between the U.S. and Ukraine appeared strained when Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky traveled to talk with Trump, but left early after a meeting at the White House descended into arguments with Trump and Vice President JD Vance. Trump announced soon after his administration would stop sending military aid and sharing intelligence with Ukraine. When Zelensky agreed to a ceasefire proposal, the U.S. agreed to restart cooperation.
“It’s been chaotic,” said Groysman.
While the majority of Scrantonians have been supportive, Groysman said he has experienced more people reacting angrily when he has a Ukrainian flag.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“When I first encountered it, I didn’t expect it,” Groysman said. “I was shocked by it. But now, whenever I’m running out there with my flag, I expect nasty things to be said. And if I go for a run and I didn’t get one bad word, that’s a win for me.”
Groysman said people yell, ‘Go back to Russia” out of their vehicles as they drive past him.
He said he tries to stay hopeful for Ukraine’s future and believes in the importance of Ukraine defending itself.
His home in South Scranton has a Ukrainian flag that hangs off of the corner of his white porch. Inside the window to the right of the porch is a sign that says “Stand with Ukraine” with a soldier on it, and if you look close enough at the corner of his fence there is a strip of blue and yellow tape for the Ukrainian colors.
While he sometimes struggles with guilt for not being there to fight, he will continue with his Scranton 4 Ukraine fundraiser to send financial support to those in need. He said the organization has raised more than $35,000 to send humanitarian supplies over since it launched in 2022.
He said that he admires Zelenskyy’s resolve as the war has continued and made sure to show support for the Ukrainian president during his visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant last September.
The factory produces 155 millimeter howitzer rounds and has ramped up production since Russia’s full-scale invasion back in 2022. The plant is one of three production facilities in the state that combined is now putting out 36,000 rounds a month. From 2009 to 2017 the output was at about 9,000 rounds a month. A representative with the company that owns the factory, General Dynamics and Tactical Systems, said they cannot share the exact numbers of how many jobs have been added to meet the demand, but he did say that the increase in the production of the artillery metal parts at the Scranton plant from 2022 to now has resulted in over 100 jobs.

According to a representative with the U.S. Army Joint Military Command, production has not been slowed in the last few weeks with the current political climate.
Even though Groysman did not see Zelenskyy in the vehicles that drove by he said that he was happy to be outside the plant wearing Ukrainian colors. Later, Groysman said he saw Zelenskyy comment online about seeing the group in Ukrainian colors and thanking them for being there. And that was enough for him.
Here vs. There
After service on a Sunday in late March, Ruslan Boroyvyi sat in front of a wall covered in photo collages, Ukrainian colors, and the unmistakable Ukrainian ‘trident’, talking about his loved ones back in Ukraine.
He is pastor for the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church who moved to Philadelphia in 2021 from the southwestern part of Ukraine. But that weekend he was at the Ukrainian Homestead in Lehighton, in Carbon County for a retreat for Ukrainians.
By the door sat a large plastic tub waiting to be filled with money to support people in Ukraine.
Borovyi said his home country feels a little betrayed by the shifting stances in the United States.
And as for the fighting, he said people have gotten used to life under wartime conditions and that scares him.
“It’s not normal…the whole situation, but it’s a normal reaction of people to just get used to it and try to live their lives under this circumstance,” Boroyvi said.

Borovyi tries to preach hope to his parishioners. But he said hope is not knowing that everything will be all right, but believing that the steps people take matter.
As the war drags on, many Ukrainian Americans said they will keep doing what they can to help their former home from Pennsylvania.
Ulana Prociuk’s parents came to the United States after World War II. She is still in touch with her Ukrainian heritage and works as an administrator for the Ukrainian Homestead.
Prociuk grew up hearing about Russian and German tanks moving across the country during World War II and just talking about the three-year war now makes her tear up. She has family in Ukraine and said they are scared. But she said she believes the Ukrainian people are resilient and will fight for as long as it takes to defend their freedom.
After hearing her parents’ stories about living under the Soviet Union’s iron fist, she feels blessed to enjoy the freedoms offered to her here. She had family, including her grandmother, sent to Siberia as punishment back then. It was a trip her grandmother did not survive. She died on the cattle car and “they just threw her (body) out,” Prociuk said.
To her, many Americans do not understand what it was like under a communist regime and why stopping Russia from taking over Ukraine is so important.
After Borovyi’s service, Eugenia Podalak sat on a chair resting both hands on top of her cane, talking about her childhood.
She said Ukrainians only want to live free, while not giving up their independence as a country. Her family left Ukraine in 1945 and moved to America in 1949. She first settled in Philadelphia before moving to Lehighton.
Like Prociuk, Podalak had family members sent to Siberia as punishment.

Now 87, Podalak remembers living in occupied Ukraine and bombings by both the Germans and Russians. One of her most vivid childhood memories is going to the basement of her house only minutes before one bomb landed in the family kitchen.
“I just hope people in the United States understand that Ukrainians, we want our own country,” Podalak said.
She is American but remains connected to her home country and its traditions. Her children and grandchildren all speak Ukrainian.
As the war drags on
Sitting outside of a Starbucks in Dickson City on an overcast Monday, Alexii Chankov is dressed in a New York City Ranger’s sweatshirt and hat. He’s getting the attention of at least one other Rangers fan who called to Chankov at the table as he was getting into his car in the parking lot.
He grew up playing hockey in Russia and the New York City team was a natural fit when he moved there. And his love for New York sports goes beyond just the Rangers as he jokes that his favorite football team is the worst in the league– the New York Jets.
His wife, Yelena Smekodub, sat next to him in a grey sweatshirt, occasionally translating for her husband who moved to the country more recently than she did.
Watching the war drag on has been taxing for the two. They wish people would understand Ukrainians did not ask for the war, that it must defend itself, and ultimately the people just want peace. But neither has much hope in negotiations or faith that Russian President Vladimir Putin will abide by any peace agreements.

Russian citizens are also struggling with the cost of war – a conflict most of them did not want either, Smekodub and Chankov said.
In Russia, Chankov said prices for goods are soaring, putting tremendous strain on the population. Chankov also said he has a teenage nephew who’s afraid to be outside, because he might be taken to go fight in the war.
And the mental toll is getting to Russian parents as well. Chankov said a school friend who lost a son in the war was outside demanding to know where her son was and was arrested. Russia uses mass graves, so it is hard to find the dead, he said.
The divide that is forming between Russia and Ukraine is sad to both. Smekodub moved to the U.S. when it was still the Soviet Union. But even when the Soviet Union fell, she said people freely traveled between Russia and Ukraine. She compared it to traveling between Canada and the U.S.
When Russia invaded, she had an uncle in Moscow and her father was in Dnipro which is on the eastern side of Ukraine. And the Ukrainian side is now angry with the Russian side. She said her family in Ukraine often goes without electricity or running water.
“All of a sudden you have these people going, ‘Oh, we hate Ukrainians? Since when?,” Smekodub said. “And Ukrainians go, ‘We hate you Russians.’ Since when?”
To them, the problem is Putin, not the people.
One common refrain from Ukrainian Americans who spoke with Pennsylvania Capital-Star is the one good thing the Trump administration seems to have done is that it has caused the rest of Europe to come to the realization they can no longer depend on the United States.
“It’s nice to see Europe waking up because they know what’s at stake,” Groysman said.

The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is known for responding to extreme weather like hurricanes and wildfires — the kinds of disasters that are becoming more intense and common as climate change gets worse. But the agency also has a program that sends billions of dollars to communities, municipalities, and states proactively so that they can prepare for these events before they hit.
In an internal FEMA memorandum obtained and first reported by Grist, the Trump administration announced its plans to dismantle that program — the biggest climate adaptation initiative the federal government has ever funded — even as disasters incur hundreds of billions of dollars worth of damages across the United States. The decision comes as at least seven people were killed this week as tornadoes and catastrophic flooding descended on the central United States in what meteorologists called a once in a generation event.
The Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, or BRIC, was established in 2018 during President Donald Trump’s first term, replacing a similar FEMA initiative. BRIC’s first round of funding was launched in 2020, when Trump was still in office, and in 2023, the program awarded close to a billion dollars to scores of communities, states, and tribal nations across the country. In January, before Trump began his second term, the agency opened its fiscal year 2024 notice of funding, with $750 million in matching grants made available to applicants from areas that received a major disaster declaration within the past seven years.
But FEMA now aims to cancel those grants and any other BRIC grants that have not been paid out yet by the federal government, according to the pre-decisional memo dated April 2 from Cameron Hamilton, a Trump administration official who is serving as FEMA administrator until the president appoints a permanent head of the agency.
“Following the administration’s direction, FEMA is working to … implement the principles of cost efficiency and common sense to our approaches and investments,” the memo says. BRIC generally shoulders 75 percent of the cost of a given resilience project, and up to 90 percent of the cost of projects in disadvantaged communities. The program’s emphasis on equity is what may have marked it for demolition — the Trump administration has been systematically dismantling Biden-era efforts to infuse equity into governmental programs and direct more climate spending toward underrepresented groups.
FEMA employees disputed Hamilton’s argument in the memo that BRIC grants “have not enhanced the level of hazard mitigation as much as desired.”
“I don’t know where that came from,” said one agency employee who preferred to stay anonymous.

According to a source within the agency, the Trump administration asked BRIC staffers to offer justification for the program and its Direct Technical Assistance sister initiative, which offers non-financial support to help communities navigate the BRIC funding process and identify the hazards they face. The request was made on April 1 with an April 2  deadline.
With a tight turnaround, staffers offered success stories from across the country. BRIC awards have helped communities bury power lines, build culverts, protect wastewater facilities from being inundated by flooding, and upgrade power stations. If BRIC is frozen, communities will no longer be able to apply for the grants for fiscal year 2024 made available in January. Projects that have been selected in past years but not yet disbursed funds will no longer receive payment. Partially completed projects will be scrutinized and reviewed, the memo said.
“The administration now has one of FEMA’s most effective grant programs on the chopping block,” said Shana Udvardy, a senior climate resilience policy analyst with the Climate and Energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists. “It’s oversubscribed almost every single year.” In fiscal year 2023, FEMA received more than 1,200 subapplications across all 50 states, 35 tribes, five territories, and Washington, D.C., totaling more than $5.6 billion in requests. It was able to provide less than a fifth of the money requested.
A looming question is whether FEMA can yank grants that are being funded with money appropriated by Congress. The 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, also known as the bipartisan infrastructure law, allocated approximately $6.8 billion to FEMA for community-wide mitigation efforts, with a portion of this funding directed to the BRIC program. “If this administration does away with the program, it goes against a law that Congress passed,” Udvardy said, “so there’s a concern there to be raised.”

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) Accessing quality care in Kentucky is a daily challenge. The state is ranked ninth worst in the country for overall health and sixth worse in overall health for women and children.
Planned Parenthood has been a trusted safety net provider in Kentucky since 1932, helping fill gaps in a state where there are already far too few options for essential care, providing services like birth control, wellness exams and preventive screenings. Thousands of people, 52% of whom live under the federal poverty line, see us every year in Louisville and Lexington, often traveling great distances from across the state to receive care. Yet today, these critical services for Kentuckians are under attack at every level of government.
Title X is under attack: The Trump administration is withholding tens of millions of dollars of Title X funding from Planned Parenthood affiliates nationwide, including here in Kentucky. This attack on the nation’s only family planning program will lead to more than 3,500 Kentuckians with low incomes facing increased barriers to care — or the possible loss of their health care options altogether.
Title X funds a wide range of essential health services for people who often rely on Planned Parenthood as their sole provider for care. For many of our patients, care supported by Title X funding may be the only affordable option.
Medicaid is also at risk: Politicians are spreading exaggerations and falsehoods, trivializing the successes of Medicaid and working hard to strip affordable health care away from those who need it most. In Congress, it has been widely reported that Republican leaders are weighing enormous cuts to Medicaid to pay for an extension of tax cuts for the wealthy.
In Kentucky, Planned Parenthood is a key provider of essential care for Medicaid recipients, which covers 45% of births statewide.
At the same time, last week the U.S. Supreme Court heard a case out of South Carolina that threatens Planned Parenthood’s role in Medicaid. Federal law requires that Medicaid include “any qualified provider” in the program. But in South Carolina, lawmakers are attempting to cut Planned Parenthood out, solely because of its association with abortion care. 
If the Supreme Court allows states to target a trusted provider solely based on politics, it’s a safe bet that Kentucky will follow suit. Since 2017, the state has prohibited spending state dollars outside Medicaid on any Planned Parenthood services. They’ve also passed recent bills targeting other parts of Medicaid, including work requirements and gender-affirming care. Carving us out of Medicaid altogether will make the state less free and less healthy. Inevitably, Kentucky would experience more unintended pregnancies, missed cancer diagnoses and untreated sexually transmitted infections.
If any of these efforts succeed, the consequences for Kentucky will be catastrophic. The state simply cannot afford to lose Planned Parenthood’s services. If Congress cuts Medicaid funding, or if Kentucky copies South Carolina to block Medicaid patients from accessing Planned Parenthood, this combined with the Title X cuts mean other providers will not be able to absorb the patient load.
The politicians pushing for Medicaid and Title X cuts and blocking free choice of patients to choose Planned Parenthood don’t seem to care. They also don’t care that because of the harmful Hyde amendment, Title X and Medicaid already don’t cover abortions. What they do care about is punishment: punishing Planned Parenthood, punishing our patients, and punishing people with low incomes — all to appease their anti-abortion backers.
To our patients, please know that we are fighting this every step of the way — no matter what. Medicaid and Title X are critical programs in Kentucky and across the country, and if politicians do the right thing, they can continue to be for years to come.

(Capital-Star photo by John Cole)Pennsylvania Republicans secured big victories in the 2024 election, but 2026 was clearly on the minds of a few potential candidates for governor at an annual gathering of conservatives in the suburbs of Harrisburg.
“Next November, the Keystone State will send a Republican to the governor’s mansion,” said state Treasurer Stacy Garrity.
“In order for us to have an America First agenda, we’ve got to have the governor’s office,” U.S. Rep. Dan Meuser (R-9th District) said. “My friends, we definitely need a governor who has a plan for Pennsylvania, not a plan for Pennsylvania Avenue.”
Both elected officials and potential 2026 hopefuls delivered speeches at the 36th annual Pennsylvania Leadership Conference in Camp Hill, Cumberland County, and mingled with conservative activists. Over the past few months, both have said that they are considering challenging Gov. Josh Shapiro in the 2026 race.
During the successful 2024 election for Republicans which saw Donald Trump carry the White House, and Dave McCormick defeat longtime incumbent U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Garrity secured a second term to serve as state treasurer. She broke the record for most votes received in a statewide election during her victory over Democratic challenger Erin McClelland.
Meuser, who was first elected to Congress in 2018, cruised to reelection in November to represent the conservative 9th Congressional District, which spans a large portion of central and northeast Pennsylvania.
Both are allies of President Trump.
They both spoke at length about their support for Trump’s agenda, including his administration’s actions on the economy, support for natural gas, immigration, and foreign policy.
Garrity, serving her second term as state Treasurer, and Meuser, who was the Secretary of Revenue under former Gov. Tom Corbett, both touted their experience with leading offices tasked with handling taxpayer dollars.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
They talked about that as an asset for Pennsylvanians, while also promoting the cuts to the federal government made by billionaire Elon Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).
“Who here is excited about what Elon and DOGE are doing,” Garrity asked to the crowd which applauded. “Well, guess what? My office is doing that right here in Pennsylvania.”
Meuser also applauded DOGE for “attacking debt, overspending, and government expansion.”
“The left and the swamp are fighting back like their life depends upon it, because I think it does,” Meuser said about DOGE.
Following their speeches, Garrity and Meuser confirmed their interest in potentially running for governor and said they’d have to make a decision in the next few months.
“It’s really an honor that so many people have asked me to think about it,” Garrity told the Capital-Star on Saturday. “We’d have to make a decision, probably in the summer.”
“I think the personal decision needs to be made relatively soon,” Meuser told reporters on Saturday. “And the rest of the pieces of the plan need to be brought together, but I would imagine just a public announcement can wait until mid-summer, so maybe August 1, or something like that.”

“I’m also aware of the demands of those who want to support from the party as well as President Trump,” he added. “So, I wouldn’t run without his support.”
Meuser added that he thinks it’ll be difficult to defeat any incumbent governor, which is why he believes the party needs to be united in order to defeat Shapiro.
During the 2022 primary election, the Pennsylvania Republican Party did not endorse a candidate for governor in the crowded race, while Trump delivered a last minute endorsement to state Sen. Doug Mastriano.
After Democrats won three straight gubernatorial races in Pennsylvania, all nearly by double digits, Garrity and Meuser believe the Commonwealth needs a change.
Garrity said she thinks the message should be the party asking voters if they are happy with the way things are going in the state.
“I mean, we spend, every year, billions more, I mean billions: This year, $3.5 billion more than what we bring in,” Garrity told the Capital-Star.
Meuser also argued that there’s been “no results” in Pennsylvania.
“There’s a lot of talk. There’s little action,” Meuser told reporters. “What is better in Pennsylvania over the last 10 years, except we have a $51 billion spending.”
Meuser also claimed Pennsylvania would be better off with a “pro-energy governor.”
“We’re being left behind,” Meuser said.
However, Shapiro has consistently held a positive approval rating.
Mastriano, the GOP nominee for governor in 2022 who lost to Shapiro by double digits, is also reportedly weighing another run for the office. He was not in attendance.
In a recent radio interview with WJFP-AM 740, Mastriano floated teaming up with Garrity to run as a ticket, saying the two would be “unbeatable.”
Candidates for governor and lieutenant governor run in separate primaries in Pennsylvania, although some endorse one another in those races. In 2022, Shapiro endorsed Austin Davis for lieutenant governor, who won the Democratic Party primary over state Rep. Brian Sims and Ray Sosa. Mastriano endorsed Teddy Daniels for lieutenant governor, who ended up finishing in third place in the nine-candidate GOP race.

Garrity told the Capital-Star on Saturday that “we really haven’t had any conversations,” when asked about teaming up with Mastriano to run.
“I have a great working relationship with the senator,” Garrity said. “He does a lot of good things for veterans, and I like what he’s doing, but we have not talked about it.”
During Mastriano’s 2022 bid for governor, Shapiro’s campaign spent money on an ad that ran during the GOP primary linking Mastriano to Trump.
Mastriano helped organize panels that falsely questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election, and buses to attend Trump’s rally on January 6, 2021, before a mob attacked the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential results and keep a defeated president in power. Mastriano said he did not enter the Capitol building that day or cross police lines, although some of his Democratic colleagues in the state Senate called for him to resign for being in attendance at the rally.
Following Trump’s 2020 defeat to Joe Biden, Meuser joined seven of his Pennsylvania Republican colleagues in voting against certifying the election results, despite no evidence supporting any election fraud claims that would have changed the outcome of the election.
Garrity also seemingly questioned the legitimacy of the 2020 election during a speech in January 2021, but has since walked those comments back.
Garrity and Meuser support Trump’s tariffs
Trump’s recent announcement of taxing imported products from around the world was not a major theme at the conservative gathering. However, Garrity and Meuser both expressed their support for Trump’s tariff policy during their speeches to attendees. 
Business owners who purchase goods from outside the U.S. will have to pay the increased duty rates to bring the products over the border, unless Trump carves out exceptions for certain industries.
“He’s restoring fair trade balance with the United States and our trading partners by putting tariffs on countries that place tariffs on American goods,” Garrity said on Friday.

She described his tariff policy, along with other parts of his agenda as “common sense measures” that are good for the American people and a “death sentence for the evil forces at play within our own country and abroad.”
“Tariffs, we’ve heard a little bit about lately, are being used to increase domestic production,” Meuser said on Saturday. “And ladies and gentlemen, seriously, over the last 25 years, free trade has been equivalent to unfair trade for the United States of America, and we’re correcting it, and we’re correcting it on Trump time.”
“The markets are having a tough time dealing with that, but he’s got his fingers on the pulse of this situation, and I do believe it’s going to work out in the manner that it’s intended,” he added.
Following Trump’s tariff announcement on Wednesday, it was the worst week for the United States stock market since the coronavirus pandemic.
Garrity expressed optimism that Trump’s tariff policies will benefit the American worker, saying “these countries, you can see it already, they are going to work with us.”
“I come from the private sector, and we had to shut down a business unit, 250 jobs. You know where they went? China,” she added. “I think anything that we’re doing to bring manufacturing jobs back into America is a great thing.”
Meuser said the markets reacting the past few days is “obviously not a favorable situation,” but said Trump’s plan is a good one. He believes the trade agreements and tariffs are “going to open up new markets” for the United States.
“So, what we’re going to do is work through the tariffs. We’re going to negotiate what’s best for America, but equivalent for the world,” Meuser told reporters. “In the past, it was very imbalanced. So, we need to create the balance.”
According to reporting by States Newsroom, rising prices under Trump’s tariff scenario are likely to cost an extra $2,400 to $3,400 per family, according to the Yale Budget Lab, with most of the financial burden falling on the lowest-income households.
An analysis from the Peterson Institute on International Economics estimated the typical American household would lose over $1,200, just from the 25% tariffs already imposed on China, Canada and Mexico.
Supporters of Trump argue that the tariffs levied against foreign countries will help promote American manufacturing and jobs.
Shapiro blasted Trump’s tariff stance on Wednesday, calling it “disastrous, reckless policy” and expressed concern about how it will impact businesses and consumers in the state.
“I just wish the president wasn’t working against us as recklessly as he is,” Shapiro said Wednesday. “This tariff war that he is starting, this button that he is pushing is going to have one effect, and that effect is to drive up costs on consumers and businesses throughout Pennsylvania at a time where we can’t afford that, and it’s going to make our lives way more difficult.”
Never say never,” Pa. Senator Scott Martin says.
State Sen. Scott Martin (R-Lancaster) also delivered an address at the conference on Friday. As the Chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, he spent the bulk of his speech talking about the upcoming budget and expressing his concerns about Shapiro’s spending proposal.
“We’re kind of standing on an edge of a cliff,” Martin said. “Are we going to turn around and walk back down to a healthy Pennsylvania? Or are we going to allow this governor, his insatiable appetite to just keep spending more money, help take us over the cliff?”
In the previous gubernatorial race, Martin considered a run for the office and even launched an exploratory committee, but ultimately decided against joining the race in 2022 after breaking his leg.
Martin told reporters on Friday that he was in attendance at the conference to outline the goals of the Senate Republican Caucus, but said he isn’t ruling out a run just yet for 2026.
“I’m not going to ever get ahead of my family on something like that either, but people are talking to me about it, but we’ll take it as it goes and see where the winds blow,” Martin said. “But right now, I’m really focused in my current role.”
“You never say never for anything,” he added, “but at the end of the day, there’s a lot to weigh out with that.”
Are Democrats gaining momentum? 
While the 2024 election was a success for Republicans in the Keystone State, Democrats in the state have already secured two special election victories this year. Democrat Dan Goughnour’s victory for the state House’s 35th District ensured that Republicans will remain in the minority in that chamber.
However, Democrat James Malone’s victory in a special election for the state Senate’s 36th District over Lancaster County Republican Commissioner Josh Parsons has garnered national attention, since Trump won the district over Vice President Kamala Harris by more than 15% in November. It’s also the first time since 1879 that a Democrat will represent Lancaster County in the Pennsylvania Senate.
Despite the upset victory, Republicans said they are confident it’s not a sign of things to come, with some citing voter registration gains made by the party in recent years.

Garrity wins straw poll
As-is tradition at Pennsylvania Leadership Conference, results of a straw poll of attendees are announced at the conclusion of the three-day gathering.
Scott Davis, President and CEO of the Cybersecurity Association of Pennsylvania, polled attendees on a wide range of issues, including the GOP race for governor. He said 267 people participated.
Garrity led the way with 41.1% of attendees saying she should be the GOP candidate for governor in 2026, followed by Meuser with 9.13%, and Mastriano in 3rd place with 6.39%. State Sens. Kristin Phillips-Hill (R-York) and Martin were tied with 2.28% of the vote.
Garrity also topped the previous year’s straw poll, although it was much more divided with her only tallying 7% of the vote. 
2021 was the last time PA Leadership Conference conducted a poll one year prior to a gubernatorial race. Mastriano was the preferred GOP candidate in that poll, who later became the nominee one year later.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1_720.jpg,,,2025-04-07 06:02:04.433083

The platform has helped connect military veterans to employment resources, provided tutoring services for children and tools to learn different languages, all for free — federal funding through IMLS offsets the costs of the $1.6 million system. 
“All of these resources, which would ordinarily cost individual libraries or even individuals a lot of money if they wanted access, are shared here as a resource with all public libraries,” said Lisa Varga, executive director for the Virginia Library Association.
She added that the platform is also available to Virginia’s schools and is “an incredible asset, because there are so many schools, like rural schools, that don’t have the money for these databases.” IMLS grants make it possible for every student in the state to have access to programs and services like FindItVirginia, Varga said.
 Federal agencies in the crosshairs

The Institute of Museum and Library Services, the primary source of federal support for the nation’s museums and libraries, is one of the several entities included for elimination in Trump’s March 14 executive order to cut government waste, along with the United States Interagency Council on Homelessness and the Minority Business Development Agency.
In the order, Trump directed the government entities to be “eliminated to the maximum extent consistent with applicable law” and to “reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel” to the minimum required by law. 
The order also directed the offices to “reject” funding requests if they were inconsistent with the president’s directive. The office had seven days to file a plan, but Trump appointed a new IMLS director in the closing days, which could have led to the office’s delay in submitting its plans. 
The public learned later that officials placed staff on administrative leave before the end of March.
Varga said, as of last week, she was unaware of any plan IMLS may have drawn up or submitted. In the meantime, libraries are now “scrambling” to ensure they can still provide resources.
“The hard part is not knowing, and we don’t know what to plan for,” Varga said. 
Virginia received at least $6 million in grants from IMLS in 2024 to help fund educational programs and digitize historical records, according to agency records. Those funds were provided through the Library Services and Technology Act, which is designed to support library services, technology, access and literacy programs for underserved communities.
The funding has also supported higher education institutions like Old Dominion University, Virginia Tech’s libraries, Virginia Union University’s Center for African American History and Culture & Library Services, George Mason University’s Virtual Library of Virginia and the University of Virginia Library.
 Statewide implications for universities, museums and libraries

In 2024, the Children’s Museum of Richmond received a $188,000 grant from the Museums for America Grant fund to expand its school readiness programs and resources in the Richmond area. The grant will also help educators with Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Education to gather insights.
Sarah Newman, a spokeswoman for the Children’s Museum of Richmond, said the organization is still assessing the implications of the IMLS suspension. Other institutions, including the Christiansburg Institute and the Virginia Museum of Contemporary Art, are doing the same.
Newman said that nearly half of Virginia’s kindergartners still need to build literacy, math, self-regulation and social development skills. In response, the museum supports families preparing children for kindergarten through its Trailblazer Club. She said the disparities are even more alarming for Hispanic and English language learners. The threat of losing funding could devastate the program and several others.
“As a small nonprofit, this funding is not just meaningful—-it’s essential. The Museums for America grant enables us to commit staff time, develop curriculum, offer materials to families, and build lasting partnerships with early learning providers. Without this investment, the Trailblazer Club would not be possible at its current scale.”
Annually, IMLS awards funding to states including Virginia from the Grants to State Library Administrative Agencies fund, which is the largest source of federal dollars for library services in the U.S.
Last year, the Library of Virginia (LVA) received $9.7 million from IMLS, including $4.3 million dedicated to supporting the library’s goals over the next five years: developing community libraries for “lifelong learning” and “civic engagement”; providing access to information and cultural heritage to develop an informed community; and enhancing training for library leadership and staff to adapt to a changing environment.
The grant funding has supported the state’s newspaper archive program, adult services consulting and public library infrastructure.

Dennis Clark, the Librarian of Virginia, stated that it is “extremely unlikely” the Library of Virginia would be able to make up any funding cuts to its statewide initiatives. He noted that 16% of the library’s budget comes from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, and this funding supports between 30 and 35 positions, which accounts for 25% of the Library of Virginia’s workforce.
“Rural public and school libraries in particular depend on the online databases, summer reading programs, and interlibrary loans that IMLS funding provides,” Clark said in a statement. “Libraries are the nexus of community and civic engagement, and are available to every Virginian, regardless of education, income, or status and the elimination of the IMLS puts that in jeopardy.”
Clark said the library expects the funding from the grants to remain available through the end of the fiscal year, which closes Sept. 30. However, as of Friday afternoon, the library has not received its last funding infusion. 
“All other funding — the majority of what Virginia receives — would likely be considered discretionary, and it’s unlikely that those obligations will be met, as there are no longer active IMLS employees,” Clark said. 
He said given that the Museum and Library Services Act expires this year, and the intent of Trump’s executive order, the act “seems unlikely to be reauthorized.”

The Rhode Island Clean Water Association is hosting a series of open houses at five local wastewater treatment plans starting Tuesday. The public events aim to promote awareness and understanding of the typically closed-door process responsible for turning wastewater into clean water, able to be discharged without environmental or human health consequences.
“This is some major infrastructure that is hidden in plain sight and taken for granted,” Peter Connell, president of the Clean Water Association, said in a statement. “You really need to see the process to appreciate what happens after you flush the toilet.”
Rhode Island’s 19 treatment plants, known as water resource recovery facilities, process more than 120 million gallons of wastewater each day, ensuring that the water returned to the environment is clean and safe. All facilities are permitted and inspected by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management for compliance with state environmental regulations.
Open house dates and locations are:

10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Tuesday April 8, at the Bristol Wastewater Treatment Facility at 2 Plant St., Bristol
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Wednesday, April 9, at the Newport Wastewater Treatment Facility at JT Connell Highway, Newport
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Thursday, April 10, at the Quonset Point Wastewater Treatment Facility at 150 Zarbo Ave., North Kingstown
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, April 12, at the Fields Point Wastewater Treatment Facility at 2 Ernest St., Providence
10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday, April 12, at the Warwick Wastewater Treatment Facility at 125 Arthur W. Devine Boulevard, Warwick (rain date, April 19)

Tours will be offered throughout the designated time frames and last 45 minutes. Visitors are asked to avoid wearing open-toed or high-heeled shoes or flip-flops.
More information is available on the Rhode Island Clean Water Association website.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)The U.S. Justice Department announced last week that it will surge FBI assets across the country to address unresolved violent crimes in areas with high Native American populations, including crimes related to missing and murdered Indigenous people.
The FBI will send 60 personnel, rotating in 90-day temporary duty assignments over a six-month period. A news release described the effort as “Operation Not Forgotten” and said it will be “the longest and most intense national deployment of FBI resources to address Indian Country crime to date.”
FBI personnel will support field offices in Albuquerque; Denver; Detroit; Jackson, Mississippi; Minneapolis; Oklahoma City; Phoenix; Portland, Oregon; Seattle; and Salt Lake City. The FBI will work in partnership with other federal and tribal law enforcement agencies across jurisdictions, the Justice Department said, including the Bureau of Indian Affairs Missing and Murdered Unit.
The territory of the FBI’s Minneapolis office includes North Dakota.
At the beginning of fiscal year 2025, the FBI’s Indian Country program had approximately 4,300 open investigations, including over 900 death investigations, 1,000 child abuse investigations, and more than 500 domestic violence and adult sexual abuse investigations, according to the news release.
“Crime rates in American Indian and Alaska Native communities are unacceptably high,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in the release. “By surging FBI resources and collaborating closely with U.S. attorneys and tribal law enforcement to prosecute cases, the Department of Justice will help deliver the accountability that these communities deserve.”
FBI director Kash Patel said in the news release that “the FBI will manhunt violent criminals on all lands” and also “find those who have gone missing.”

(Helaina Thompson/Courtesy of Over the Moon Farm)Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.



North Carolina food banks, small farms will suffer
Trump administration cuts have North Carolina food assistance programs and farmers confused and worried. As Raleigh’s News & Observer reported in March, the cuts will eliminate around $11.4 million from the state’s share of the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement Program and $19 million from the Local Food for Schools Cooperative Agreement Program.
Amy Beros, CEO of the nonprofit Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina, told the N&O that “It’s [the Trump administration action] going to take healthy food away from children and funds away from family farms.”
Likewise, Patrick Brown, a small farmer from Henderson, said, “I couldn’t believe the program was going to be killed.”
– Rob Schofield



Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
A mixed response from states
The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.











A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture



“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
Creating a new food system
In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

For over a decade I have helped lead an annual trip of community leaders from western Colorado to meet with federal agencies and our members of Congress. We travel to Washington, D.C., because the U.S. Constitution established the need for a compact and independent seat for the federal government.
In contrast, Project 2025 — the current administration’s top-down blueprint to dismantle government and inspire “trauma” in its workforce — undermines this critical foundation of our republic.
Project 2025 attacks many things, including America’s public lands. It would open up our national estate to increased privatization, industrialization and outright liquidation. In its section on the Department of Interior, Project 2025 specifically states: “(The Bureau of Land Management) headquarters belongs in the American West.” But my own experience has led me to think otherwise, and to conclude that America’s Founders who debated, drafted and then agreed on our Constitution, are instead the ones who are correct.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Each year, we travel from our valley to meet with leadership at agencies and with all our federal elected officials or offices. In just a few days we can meet with the Interior Department and its agencies like the bureaus of Land Management and of Reclamation to talk about public lands and irrigation projects.
Our rural delegation, which includes farmers, can meet with U.S. Department of Agriculture, and agencies such as the Natural Resources Conservation Service to talk about soil health funding and program priorities, and with the Forest Service to talk about managing the local watersheds. Within a few days we bring concerns and questions directly to top leaders of several agencies and to our representatives only because we are able to visit a single seat of government.
I feel confident that this is as the Founders intended.
The rationale for relocating BLM headquarters — to better serve public lands stakeholders — is dubious. Project 2025 itself admits that the agency is already highly decentralized, writing that “97 percent of BLM employees are located in the American West.” These state and field offices, and agency employees who staff them, are indeed critical. But Project 2025 also demands vast federal workforce reductions. This transparent bad-faith argument made by Project 2025 should be a warning to any and all who want to see the efficient and proper management of our public lands.
BLM headquarters belongs with its department, which belongs with fellow federal departments in the independent and compact seat of government. This most efficiently allows states, citizens and stakeholders from across a far-flung nation the opportunity to petition the government for redress. And it better meets other purposes for which businesses, states and localities, and citizens might have to meet, share information, and work with the variety of agencies that make up our national government.
Like most of the parts of our Constitution, the idea and particulars of a federal seat of government and its agencies was discussed and debated. In the Federalist Papers, James Madison emphasized the necessity of complete authority at the seat of government to ensure its independence and effectiveness. “… but a dependence of the general government on the State (that holds the seat of authority) … for protection in the exercise of their duty, might bring on the national councils an imputation of awe or influence, equally dishonorable to the (federal government) and dissatisfactory to the other (states).”
The American republic is a union of free and sovereign states. As Madison and the Founders rightfully concluded, a functional federal government protects the individual sovereignty of all the states and of all its citizens. States, and the people, serve to check overreach by the federal government. And the federal government is also sovereign, as a necessary force to provide balance among the needs and perspectives of the varied states.
Madison saw a federal seat of government and its agencies as key to protecting the republic’s own independence, which in turn best guards the equal footing of the states. One can suppose that the Constitution’s authors wanted to ensure that the presence of the federal government in any of the various states could not compromise the nation’s ability to perform its duties with impartiality.
That federal functions not be paired closely with particular states “has the more weight, as the gradual accumulation of public improvements at the stationary residence of the government would be both too great a public pledge to be left in the hands of a single State,” Madison wrote.
Project 2025 does not seek to create more efficiency, but to deconstruct the federal government and to privatize public lands and resources so that a narrow set of wealthy interests can take an even greater share. Madison correctly saw peril in a weak federal government and intended for the national capital to serve as its “stationary residence.” The establishment of major national agencies outside of this seat runs contrary to that purpose and need.
Project 2025 stands contrary to the shared American project. Project 2025 is not interested in better management for our public lands, more public engagement in decision-making, or even that these lands, or much of the government, remain public at all. Moving the BLM headquarters away from its department and all its sister agencies is part and parcel of the Project 2025 plan.
And no one who cherishes our national public lands ought to be fooled one bit, or for one moment, otherwise.

(Screencap/CapitolTV)From mid-December to January, workers in the Department of Human Services (DHS) were forced to process public benefits like food stamps the old fashioned way — on paper — after its system was hacked by cybercriminals.
Now, nearly four months after RIBridges — the system used to manage eligibility and applications for social services as well as the state’s health insurance marketplace — was taken offline, everything is in its right place again. 
“I would say we’re back to full system operation,” Kimberly Merolla-Brito, DHS director, told the state representatives on the health and human services subcommittee of the House Committee on Finance at a hearing last Wednesday.   
During the four-hour meeting last week, the subcommittee heard from DHS, the state’s Medicaid office, and the parent agency of both entities, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services (EOHHS), about their respective agencies’ budgetary needs and predicted challenges in the upcoming fiscal year, which begins July 1. The Rhode Island House of Representatives drives the budget-making process after the governor’s office submits its spending proposal in January.   
As the state’s health and human services agencies get back on their feet after the massive cyberattack which put the personal data of hundreds of thousands of Rhode Islanders at risk, officials continue to have a lot of tech on their wish lists. 
“I see it all through EOHHS’ budget…it’s just the unbelievable amount of technology that we’re bringing into the state,” said Rep. Teresa Tanzi, a South Kingstown Democrat, about a $31 million capital plan request to replace RIKidsBridge, which child welfare workers use to manage cases.
Other big asks include $62 million from EOHHS to modernize its Medicaid information management system, with $6.2 million coming from state revenue and the rest coming from federal funding.
The state has already encountered problems with implementing one initiative: An income verification system that would automate eligibility checks for benefits applicants. It is contracted for $8.9 million, according to the EOHHS presentation, but the contract with Experian has not yet been inked, and the initiative is not likely to take effect this year as originally intended.
There have also been issues with a $91 million initiative to replace the state’s payroll system.
There could also be trouble down the road for the state’s modernization projects for Medicaid and RIBridges, according to Linda Haley, principal legislative analyst in the House Fiscal Advisory Staff. She told lawmakers in her presentation on the EOHHS budget that the federal match rate for Medicaid funding projects may be reduced soon — from the feds supplying 75% to 90% of funding to offering a 50% match instead. 
Rhode Island, like other states, is waiting to see what the fallout will be from a Republican Congressional budget that opponents strongly suspect will have to slash Medicaid to meet its spending goals. 
But for Rhode Island residents, the state’s current technology is at least working as it should, and access to public benefits is smoother than it was in December. Merolla-Brito said her agency acknowledged customers’ access to benefits as “a guiding principle,” and DHS managed to avoid interruption of people’s benefits over the duration of the network outage.
“But we did have some bumps in the road with some of the provider payments,” Merolla-Brito said.
RIBridges was brought back online in phases starting in January, with the employee backend coming first, followed by the online interface for customers. 
As of March 29, the HealthyRhode mobile app used to access the benefits portal is back online, and has been uploaded to the Google Play store and Apple’s App Store in an updated version. An EOHHS newsletter sent to providers in March showed the HealthyRhode app has also been outfitted with a number of user-friendly improvements.
But some distrust of the service remains among users, even if things are back to normal.
“We have seen a decrease in use of the mobile app … and we have seen a decrease in use of the customer portal,” Merolla-Brito said. “So there are efforts in motion for technology adoption, to rebuild trust and to get customers back into using these technologies.”

During the summer of 2024, countless transgender and gender expansive patients expressed to me fears about what might happen to their access to gender affirming medical care if a conservative administration were to win the White House. This worst-case scenario became reality in the first weeks of 2025, when President Donald Trump signed an executive order redefining legal gender identity as a strict binary of male and female — effectively erasing recognition of nonbinary and transgender individuals and interrupting federal funding to institutions providing gender-affirming health care.
As a transgender health program intern, I have seen providers try to reassure patients of their well-being and safety while they themselves fear how their job will be affected if the laws would drastically alter the way we practice medicine.
As a gay man about to enter the medical profession, I am afraid. The recent wave of anti-trans initiatives pushed by this administration is part of a much broader effort to dismantle diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) programs across the country under the guise of “restoring meritocracy” and “leveling the playing field.” But in health care, the playing field has never been level. Minority populations continue to face disproportionate health risks and barriers to care.
DEIB is the foundation of medical education. It teaches future physicians how to address these disparities and combat the structural inequities that put vulnerable patients at risk. Studies show medical students have felt unprepared to manage transgender and gender expansive patients upon graduation. One study even claimed that only 27% of students were confident in their knowledge of the health needs of transgender patients. Beyond that, they could not correctly answer questions about race-related medical history despite affirming that understanding historical context is important in medicine. This lack of education was always a problem, and efforts were underway to solve it. Eliminating DEIB would not only erode this progress but set us back behind where we were even before we started.
In 2020, the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) rolled out the Structural Competency Curriculum which aims to train providers “to recognize and respond to the impact of upstream, structural factors on patient health and health care.” Since then, medical schools around the country have adopted the values of this curriculum and incorporated it throughout the course of their students’ training. Health equity is a core pillar of medical students’ professional development and should be embedded into the culture of patient-centric care.
When DEIB is dismantled, programs like these disappear, and awareness of health disparities among marginalized patient populations fades from the culture of those whose job is to provide the proper care and treatment.
If physicians are not trained on specific health risks that directly impact transgender patients, how can we provide adequate care? If we are not taught about racial health disparities, how will we work to combat them? If we stop prioritizing inclusion, how can we ensure equal health care for all?
Everyone deserves to be treated with respect and dignity. Legislation cannot change a person’s identity, but it will change their access to health care. Medical schools need to teach this, and we as students want to learn. Future doctors like me are watching everything that is happening, and we are worried. When students apply to medical school, the number one question they are asked is, “Why medicine?” While the answer to this question can take many different forms, the bottom line is pretty simple: We want to help people. Medical schools can make a monumental difference in how future doctors navigate this political environment and provide care to patients. We urge medical schools to keep teaching us how to do that for all patients.

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)New Hampshire reduced its business profits tax from 8.5% to 7.5% and its business enterprise tax from .75% to .55% in a series of cuts spanning from 2016 to 2024. The result, according to new research from the New Hampshire Fiscal Policy Institute, was somewhere between $795 million and $1.17 billion in forgone revenue.
“The rate reductions do not appear to have provided clear, unambiguous economic benefits to the state,” Phil Sletten, author of the study and research director at the Fiscal Policy Institute, said. “They may have, but we have not been able to measure those economic impacts in a way that is directly identifiable as a result of the tax rate reductions. However, the state not having sufficient revenue to fund existing services is a clearly identifiable risk associated with having fewer public dollars available, including from business tax revenues.”
While the timing of the study wasn’t intended to correlate with the state’s budget season — Sletten said his team was awaiting final audited figures for fiscal year 2024 to be released in March — it comes in the middle of a challenging fiscal environment for lawmakers. In February, Gov. Kelly Ayotte released her proposal for a nearly $16 billion two-year budget, which lawmakers in the state House of Representatives subsequently began debating and amending. Ayotte’s budget relies on optimistic fiscal projections that predict the state’s tax revenues will rebound sharply after years of lagging. However, the House Ways and Means Committee estimated these revenues would come in hundreds of millions of dollars lower than the governor did, and the House Finance Committee has been hacking away at the budget to make it fit into that lower projection.
In the study, Sletten explained that his team built off a similar analysis it did in 2023, adding in newly available data, and examined New Hampshire job growth, personal income growth, and overall economic growth. They compared those data points across different time periods before and after cuts and to different parts of the country with different tax rates.
“There’s not a clear pattern that would provide evidence of a direct and overriding causal relationship between business profits tax rate levels and either higher or lower in job growth in the state’s economy,” he said.
Sletten said that they created their range — $795 million to $1.17 billion — by using two different recuperation rates. In other words, if the state was able to recoup 0% of the revenue it lost from these cuts through increased economic growth, it likely would have lost out on $1.17 billion. If it had recouped 32% — a figure Sletten called “relatively high” — the state likely would’ve lost out on $795 million. Sletten said that because New Hampshire is a small state it is possible more businesses are able to travel across borders, hence the high maximum recuperation rate.
Proponents of the tax cuts said they’d spur economic growth, which would offset the loss and result in higher revenue. However, what the Fiscal Policy Institute found, Sletten said, was that there was no correlation between these tax rate reductions and economic performance, relative to other parts of the country. This does not mean the state’s total revenue decreased during that time. It actually increased, but this analysis found that those increases weren’t higher than other parts of the country without similar tax rate reductions, and they found no evidence that the tax reductions were the cause of these increases as proponents argued they would be.
“The increases that New Hampshire has seen in state corporate tax revenues are not unique to New Hampshire,” Sletten said. “If the changes were driven by state policy in New Hampshire, then New Hampshire might be breaking a trend that we’d see relative to what we see in other states. However, we see that tax revenues for state corporate taxes nationwide have increased substantially during this time period.”
In fact, he said, state business tax revenues across the country have increased even higher than in New Hampshire alone. From fiscal years 2015 to 2023, New Hampshire’s combined business tax revenues saw a 124% increase. Nationwide during this period, all 50 states collectively saw a 192% increase. The Fiscal Policy Institute also looked specifically at New Hampshire’s neighbors. Vermont saw a 166% increase and Maine saw a 167% increase during this period. Across the entirety of New England, excluding New Hampshire, there was a 172% increase during this period. However, New Hampshire did outperform Massachusetts, which saw a 105% increase.
“We can’t definitively say that there is no economic impact from the business profits or business enterprise tax rate reductions,” Sletten said. “However, it is not clear that there is an economic impact. For the business tax rate reductions to have spurred enough economic activity to generate more revenue, we would have seen those impacts in job growth, in personal income growth, in growth in the size of the economy overall in a manner that would have been much clearer than the lack of correlation that we saw.”
Sletten also explained that a huge portion of the revenue generated from the business profits tax comes from a small number of large multistate and multinational corporations. These are corporations less affected by New Hampshire policy alone, but rather by national and other state policies as well. This means the increase in their economic performance and the amount of revenue they generate for the state might not be as much a result of New Hampshire policy. It also means that the benefits of these tax cuts disproportionately went to out-of-state corporations.
“There is some significant evidence that the revenue would likely flow to shareholders or owners of the company, which may include shareholders,” he said. “Shareholders could be anywhere in the world or anywhere, depending on the company, that shares are accessible for people to buy, right? So to the extent that a business profit tax rate reduction benefits shareholders by increasing profits and those profits are then distributed to the people who own the company — whether it’s publicly traded or a private entity — those individuals don’t necessarily live in New Hampshire, right? Or have to live in New Hampshire to receive those benefits. So they could be anywhere in the world. There is some significant research … regarding who benefits when there’s a business profit tax rate reduction. And there is some component that goes to workers. But it’s generally considered by the research a relatively small share that goes to pay employees. Now that could be different in different economic environments. However, the research suggests that when a portion goes to employee pay, there’s one study that estimated that a very sizable percentage of that benefit would go to employees at the top end of the income scale in a company.”
Free-market and fiscal conservatives still argue the merits of these tax reductions.
“The purpose of business tax cuts was not to generate more state revenue,” Andrew Cline, president of the New Hampshire-based conservative think tank Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, said in an email to the Bulletin. “It was to reduce the tax burden and make New Hampshire more economically competitive, which it did.”
Cline, who said he hadn’t yet read the full study when he wrote to the Bulletin, pointed out that New Hampshire now ranks above Texas in lowest tax burden. He also pointed out that then-Gov. Maggie Hassan predicted business tax revenues would decrease after these rate reductions. They increased.
“People will debate how much of New Hampshire’s rising revenues can be attributed to the tax cuts,” Cline said. “It’s interesting that opponents claim no effect from those cuts while giving credit instead to the growing national economy, which received a boost from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. At least they’re acknowledging, even if they don’t realize it, that tax cuts have positive economic effects.”
He also argued that the increase in the number of registered businesses in good standing in New Hampshire is evidence that the tax cuts were not simply benefitting large, out-of-state corporations but were also enabling local business growth.
The Fiscal Policy Institute’s study did not examine the impacts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, a hallmark action of President Donald Trump’s first term in office. Additionally, that federal tax cut package impacted all 50 states. And New Hampshire’s further tax cuts did not give it an edge over the rest of the country, which also saw these federal cuts, the study found.
Meanwhile, Sletten prefers direct investment in citizens and cuts targeted at the least wealthy.
“If we look at the economic literature available regarding which policies do provide effective economic stimulus,” Sletten said, “policies that direct more resources and assistance to residents with low and moderate incomes, whether that’s a tax rate reduction that’s targeted at individuals with low and moderate incomes or services that support individuals or families with low and moderate incomes, those are estimated to, based on the economic modeling and evidence collected by both public and private sector entities, have a more substantial economic impact in terms of stimulating the economy per dollar invested by a public entity, such as state government or the federal government.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/biztaxescuts-1024x573.jpg,,,2025-04-07 06:02:04.433083

Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people [&#8230;]","A woman sits with her daughters at a clinic operated by a community health center in New Orleans. Such centers rely on funding from Medicaid, which congressional Republicans want to cut. (Mario Tama/Getty Images) Republicans in Congress are eyeing $880 billion in cuts to Medicaid, the joint federal-state government health care program for lower-income people.
Depending on how states respond, a Republican proposal that would slash the 90% federal contribution to states’ expanded Medicaid programs would end coverage for as many as 20 million of the 72 million people on Medicaid — or cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep them on the rolls. More than 5 million people could lose coverage if the feds impose work requirements.
In recent months, this complicated government program has increasingly come under the spotlight, so Stateline has put together a guide explaining what Medicaid is and how it operates.
1. Medicaid is not Medicare. 
Medicaid serves people with lower incomes or who have a disability. Medicare focuses primarily on older people, no matter their income.
Medicaid and Medicare were created in 1965 under President Lyndon B. Johnson. Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 or older, though younger people with special circumstances, such as permanent kidney failure or ALS, may be eligible earlier.
Medicare is a supplemental insurance program that’s limited in scope. It doesn’t pay for long-term care, most dental care or routine physical exams. Around 68.4 million people are enrolled in Medicare.
Medicaid is a more comprehensive government insurance plan that’s jointly funded by the federal government and states. Medicaid covers most nursing home care as well as home- and community-based long-term care. People on Medicaid generally don’t have any copayments. Only people and families with incomes under certain thresholds are eligible for Medicaid. About 72 million people, or a fifth of people living in the United States, receive Medicaid benefits.
2. Medicaid eligibility varies from state to state. 
In its original form, Medicaid was generally only available to children and parents or caretakers of eligible children with household incomes below 100% of the federal poverty line ($32,150 for a family of four in 2025). Over the years, the program was expanded to include some pregnant women, older adults, blind people and people with disabilities.
More than 5M could lose Medicaid coverage if feds impose work requirements

States have to follow broad federal guidelines to receive federal funding. But they have significant flexibility in how they design and administer their programs, and they have different eligibility rules and offer varying benefits.
In 2010, President Barack Obama signed into law the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, which allowed states to expand their eligibility thresholds to cover adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty line (about $21,000 for one person today), in exchange for greater federal matching funds. The District of Columbia covers parents and caretakers who earn up to 221% of the federal poverty line.
Only 10 states (Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin and Wyoming) have chosen not to expand coverage. In the non-expansion states, eligibility for caretakers and parents ranges from 15% of the federal poverty line in Texas to 105% in Tennessee. In Alabama, people can only get Medicaid if they earn at or below 18% of the federal poverty line — $4,678 a year for a three-person household.
3. Traditional Medicaid exists alongside a health insurance program for children called CHIP.
Low-income children have always been eligible for Medicaid. But in 1997, Congress created CHIP, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program. The law gave states an opportunity to draw down enhanced federal matching funds to extend Medicaid coverage to children within families who earn too much money to qualify for traditional Medicaid coverage, but make too little money to afford commercial health care.
Like Medicaid, CHIP is jointly funded by the federal government and states, but it’s not an entitlement program. CHIP is a block grant program, meaning states receive a fixed amount of federal money every year and aren’t obligated to cover everyone who meets the eligibility requirements. States get to decide, within broad federal guidelines, how their CHIP programs will work and what the income limits will be. Some states have chosen to keep their CHIP and Medicaid programs separate, while others have decided to combine them by using CHIP funds to expand Medicaid eligibility.
4. Medicaid and CHIP are significant portions of state budgets. 
In 2024, the federal government spent less on Medicaid and CHIP than on Medicare, with Medicare spending accounting for 12%, or $847.5 billion, of the federal benefit budget, and Medicaid and CHIP accounting for 8%, or $584.5 billion.
But at the same time, Medicaid is the largest source of federal funds for states, accounting for about a third of state budgets, on average, and 57% of all federal funding the states received last year.
5. Federal funding varies by state. 
Before the Affordable Care Act, federal Medicaid funding to states mostly depended on a formula known as the FMAP, or the federal medical assistance percentage, which is based on the average personal income of residents. States with lower average incomes get more financial assistance. For example, the federal government reimburses Mississippi, which is relatively poor, nearly $8 for every $10 it spends, for a net state cost of $2. But New York is only reimbursed $5. By law the FMAP can’t be less than 50%.
Medicaid cuts could hurt older adults who rely on home care, nursing homes

The ACA offered states the opportunity to expand eligibility and receive an even greater federal matching rate. In expansion states, the federal government covers 90% of costs for expansion adults. If Republicans in Congress reduce that percentage, states would have to use their own money to make up for lost federal dollars. They might have to scale back Medicaid coverage for some groups, eliminate optional benefits or reduce provider payment rates. Alternatively, they could raise taxes or make cuts in other large budget items, such as education.
Another possibility is that states that have adopted Medicaid expansion would reverse it. Nine states (Arizona, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Montana, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia) already have “trigger” laws in place that would automatically rescind expansion if the federal match rate dips below 90%. Other states are considering similar legislation.
One new analysis from KFF, a health research policy group, found that if Congress reduced the federal match for the expansion population to the percentages states get for the traditional Medicaid population — 50% for the wealthiest states and 77% for the poorest ones — it would cost states $626 billion over the next decade to keep everyone eligible under Medicaid expansion on the rolls.
6. Medicaid is the largest source of health coverage, especially for people with low incomes.
Medicaid is the single largest health payer in the nation, and is particularly important for people in poverty. Almost a fifth of people living in the United States are covered through Medicaid. But nearly half of all adults with incomes at or below the federal poverty line are insured through the program. Medicaid covers 4 out of every 10 children overall, but it covers 8 out of every 10 children below the federal poverty line. Medicaid also provides coverage for people experiencing homelessness or who are leaving incarceration.
7. Medicaid covers essential services, such as childbirth.
In exchange for receiving federal funds, states are obligated to cover essential health care services, including inpatient and outpatient hospital services, doctor visits, laboratory work and home health services, among other things. States get to decide which optional services, such as prescription drugs and physical therapy, they want to cover.
Medicaid is a significant payer of essential services. For example, the program covers 41% of all childbirths in the U.S. and covers health care services for the 40% of all adults ages 19-65 with HIV.
8. The majority of Medicaid spending goes to people with disabilities and to pay for long-term care.
ACA expansion adults — about 1 out of every 4 enrollees — accounted for 21% of total Medicaid expenditures in 2021. Children, who make up about 1 out of every 3 enrollees, only accounted for 14% of spending.
People who qualify for Medicaid because of a disability or because they are over the age of 65 make up about 1 out of every 4 enrollees. But they accounted for more than half of all Medicaid spending. That’s because these populations typically experience higher rates of chronic illness and require more complex medical care. Older people are also more likely to use nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, which can be expensive.
Cuts could also mean that older people relying on Medicaid for home-based care and long-term nursing home services could be significantly affected.
9. Some state Medicaid programs cover people who are living in the country illegally.
People who are in the country illegally are ineligible for traditional Medicaid or CHIP. But some states have carved out exceptions to extend coverage to them using state dollars.
As of January, 14 states and the District of Columbia provide Medicaid coverage to children regardless of their immigration status. And 23 states plus the District of Columbia use CHIP to cover pregnant enrollees regardless of their immigration status.
Also, seven states provide Medicaid to some adults who are here illegally. New York opted to cover those who meet the income requirements and are over the age of 65, regardless of immigration status And California provides coverage to any adults ages 19-65 who are under the income threshold, regardless of immigration status.
10. The majority of the public holds favorable views of Medicaid.
According to surveys from KFF, two-thirds of Americans say that someone close to them has received health coverage from Medicaid at some point in their lives. Half of the public also say they or someone in their family have been covered through Medicaid.
Generally, around 3 out of every 4 people — regardless of political party — say that Medicaid is very important, though Republicans are less likely than Democrats and independents to share that opinion. At the same time, a third or less of people want to see any decrease in spending on the Medicaid program. In fact, the majority of people living in states that have not expanded Medicaid under the ACA want their states to do so.

DemasThis article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. Sign up for their newsletter here.
Illinois boasts 63 miles of coastline along Lake Michigan’s southwestern shore, nearly all of which is fortified by metal breakwaters, concrete seawalls and even swaths of land built out into the lake.
These structures are meant to protect the city of Chicago and its suburbs from coastal erosion. But according to Hillary Glandon, a scientist at the Lake Michigan Biological Station in Zion, Illinois, this fortification is “part of the problem.”
“You have protection structure after protection structure after protection structure, and it has really disrupted the natural flow and processes that occur in these coastal zones,” Glandon said.
With water levels that can vary by several feet from year to year—and climate change making these variations even more unpredictable—cities across the Great Lakes are working to fortify their coastlines and prevent erosion. But traditional coastal infrastructure like breakwalls can cost tens of millions of dollars, making them a heavy financial lift for local governments. And while these breakwalls help retain sand and build up the coastline directly inland of where they’re constructed, they also block currents from carrying sediment farther down the coast, compounding the effects of erosion downstream.
Glandon and her team have a solution: Install artificial reefs in the lake’s shallows to temper the intensity of waves and preserve the shoreline directly inland. Through a federally funded pilot project, the team is studying two artificial reefs—one at Illinois Beach State Park in Zion, and another at Fort Sheridan in nearby Highland Park. They’re hoping to collect data on how these reefs impact the local shoreline to see if artificial reefs are a scalable solution to coastal erosion in the Great Lakes.
“This project was hoping to come up with some softer designs, not necessarily fully stopping that movement of sand and water, but also a more cost effective design,” Glandon said. The two reefs she’s studying are both made entirely of natural materials and built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. The reef at Fort Sheridan was built in 2020, while the one at Illinois Beach State Park was built the following year, designed as part of the University of Pennsylvania’s Healthy Port Futures program. Their approach, called “rubble ridges,” is relatively simple and involves piling dredged sand and limestone beneath the surface to block waves.
While artificial reefs have been used around the world to bolster biodiversity, their use for erosion control is new. Lake Michigan is already home to a handful of artificial reefs, most of which are located farther from shore as a habitat for marine life.
Some researchers in the U.S., though, say these could serve the dual purpose of boosting fish populations and preventing erosion, disrupting waves so that they’re less intense when they crash ashore.
“It’s a hydrodynamic optimization to get the wave energy that’’s coming into these reef structures,” said Ansel Garcia-Langley, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who’s working on another architected reef design. “As the waves hit these pillars, it forces the waves into different directions, so that they spin off into these vortices. So a lot of the energy coming in is dissipated in on itself.”
Garcia-Langley and his colleagues at MIT wrapped up their initial study of architected reefs last March, and found promising results. His team, headed by ocean science and engineering professor Michael Triantafyllou, created a unique cylindrical reef design that is intended to maximize drag on wave energy, forcing the waves through cracks in the structure to lower that energy before it hits the coast.
Reefs like these help preserve the natural flow of sand and sediment along coasts. Structures like seawalls can create what Garcia-Langley called “dead zones,” where this flow reaches a standstill, redirecting increased wave energy to the surrounding areas.
For local governments jockeying for control over the Lake Michigan shoreline, avoiding these dead zones is critical.
“The lake is valuable, right? People want to live near the lake. They want to be able to go to the beach,” Glandon said. “And so removing that possibility from a landowner due to actions upstream tends to cause some real tension.”
In Illinois, there are dozens of municipalities that border Lake Michigan, and hundreds of private landowners. Because the towns and property owners with a slice of that shoreline control their own infrastructure, shoreline protection can get heated. Sediment flows from north to south in Lake Michigan, so when one town installs a seawall, it can prevent sediment from reaching shores directly south, leaving those places more vulnerable.
This has led to heated debate between some shoreline towns, said Cody Eskew, a specialist in coastal studies with the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center. Eskew, who works closely with the Illinois Department of Natural Resources, has helped run IDNR’s Shoreline Management Working Group since 2015, holding biannual meetings with local governments who share Lake Michigan’s coastline to work through their shoreline protection plans.
“At first, I think there was just a lack of understanding of what the shoreline dynamics were in our region, especially the North Shore region,” Eskew said. “At Illinois Beach State Park, there’s a ton of sand there, but when you go a little bit farther south toward those North Shore neighborhoods, we found that there’s just not much naturally occurring sand on that piece of the shoreline. So communities are really limited in terms of, you know, what they can expect from their neighbor and getting sand from updrift.”
That makes artificial reefs particularly alluring in the Great Lakes—they’re a way to block wave energy without making erosion worse for neighbors, and they’re far cheaper than traditional infrastructure. For instance, the Illinois Department of Natural Resources recently funded a project building 22 breakwalls off the coast of Illinois Beach State Park, which cost about $73 million. Installing the beach’s rubble ridges cost $1.4 million, according to Eskew.
“The typical community is not going to have in their capital budget to be able to install something that large,” he said of the breakwalls. “So they are really looking into those more hybrid structures.”
The costs aren’t set and can vary widely, said Juliet Simpson, a coastal ecologist with MIT’s Sea Grant program who also works on their architected reefs project with Garcia-Langley. Last year, the team estimated their model to cost about $6 million per mile, while Simpson noted that other reef models can cost upwards of $10 million per mile. The team is hoping to slash that cost even further to make these protections affordable for coastal communities.
So what’s keeping this new approach to artificial reefs from taking off? According to Sean Burkholder, who heads the UPenn Healthy Port Futures team that helped design the rubble ridges, it’s simply a lack of familiarity.
“We’ve lived on shorelines that have been protected by seawalls for hundreds of years, and we kind of know that they work,” Burkholder said. “We also kind of know when they fail, and how they’re going to fail. Any type of nature-based infrastructure, they’re not super well proven.”
To prove the concept, Glandon and her team are meticulously collecting data on how the artificial reefs at Illinois Beach and Fort Sheridan impact their respective shorelines over the course of five years.
The data is already showing promising results—and according to Eskew, it’s been drawing attention from officials working on shoreline management all over Lake Michigan. If all goes well, these rubble ridges could soon appear beneath the surface of many of the Great Lakes.
“Often these types of structures are built, and there’s very few requirements for post construction monitoring.” Glandon said. “I think this is a really quantitative picture of shoreline change and aquatic habitat creation as a result of these nearshore breakwaters.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/IMG_0564-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-04-07 06:02:04.433083

(Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images)As Ohio lawmakers decide the fate of Cleveland Browns stadium funding, the Ohio Capital Journal reviewed political donations to lawmakers from Browns owners Jimmy and Dee Haslam over the last 15 months, and asked lawmakers if it would impact their decision-making.
Multiple representatives for Haslam Sports Group were contacted by email and on social media but did not respond. An inquiry to the contact information on the group’s website also did not receive a response.
Background
Ohio House Republicans unveiled its version of the state budget on April 1.It included $600 million in state-backed bonds for a new domed stadium in Brook Park for the Cleveland Browns. 
Calling it “a once-in-a-lifetime project,” House Finance Committee Chair Brian Stewart, R-Ashville, praised the deal, suggesting the stadium and similar projects, are “huge economic drivers.”
The proposal was first announced last year, with the Browns looking to leave their current home at Huntington Bank Field on the lakefront in downtown Cleveland. The team is asking for $1.2 billion in taxpayer money to help pay for the project, which may cost $2.4 billion to build. Under their plan, $600 million would come from the state in the form of bonds, and be paid back by tax revenues. 
Brook Park and Cuyahoga County would be asked for another $600 million in bonds, to be covered by parking, admissions, and income tax. The rest would be paid for by the Haslam Sports Group, which owns the Cleveland Browns, and if all goes well, the stadium will be open by 2029. 
State, county, and city officials have condemned the plan. 
Gov. Mike DeWine recommends raising the sports betting tax and using the money to create a fund that all sports teams can use. DeWine has also argued that Ohio doesn’t have the money for such a project, saying “We can’t really afford to continue to put money in sports stadiums out of a general fund.”
Ohio House Speaker Matt Huffman, R-Lima, has said the state can’t afford to fully fund public education. Last week, he submitted a proposed budget decimating the amount called for under the Fair School Funding Plan by about two-thirds, to $226 million.
Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine trying to sack lawmakers’ proposal to give $600 million to Browns

Cleveland Mayor Justin Bibb also criticized the idea, and Cuyahoga County Executive Chris Ronayne called the proposal “a risky bet with taxpayer dollars.” He believes the data isn’t there to justify his county’s investment. 
Jimmy Haslam is the Chairman and Managing Partner of the Haslam Sports Group, and his wife Susan “Dee” Haslam is CEO. They own the Browns, co-own the Milwaukee Bucks, and have operating rights to the Columbus Crew. Jimmy Haslam’s personal net worth is $8.5 billion, and the Haslam family overall is valued at $14.4billion. 
Aside from owning the Browns, the Haslams are also significant political donors. They’ve contributed millions to federal and statewide causes over the years, and most recently were among the largest individual donors opposing this past November’s Issue 1 amendment against gerrymandering. Voters rejected the amendment, which sought to remove politicians from the map-making process.
Now, several of the lawmakers who will determine if the stadium proposal ends up in the state budget have received contributions from the Haslam family. 
The Ohio Capital Journal reviewed campaign finance reports from Jan.1 2024 to April 3 2025, and asked lawmakers if this cash would impact their decision-making. 
Republicans
The majority of Haslam family donations were to Republican politicians. Jimmy and Dee Haslam held a fundraiser for J.D. Vance during his 2022 Senate race, and another for current Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno. 
The state official who has benefitted most from the Haslam family’s largesse is Huffman, the House speaker who wants to slash funding for public education. 
Between Jan. 1, 2024 and March 24, 2025, Huffman’s political action committee (PAC) Huffman for Ohio accepted $60,999 from Jimmy and Dee Haslam, according to campaign finance reports. The couple are among the Ohio House speaker’s largest individual donors. 
Huffman has voiced support for the Brook Park stadium idea. 
“I’ve heard mostly positive things from our Republican caucus about it, so we’ll see what happens here,” the news organization Signal Cleveland quoted Huffman as saying. 
“Campaign contributions do not influence policy decisions,” Huffman’s office said when asked about the donations.

Stewart, chairman of the House Finance Committee, didn’t receive donations from the Haslams directly, but his largest contribution was from Huffman’s PAC, $15,499 on Feb. 7.
 “This is going to be a destination center,” The Columbus Dispatch quoted Stewart as saying about the project. “I really do think when the ribbon is cut and people walk in the door, I think people are going to be happy that this is in Ohio.”
House Finance Committee Vice Chair Mike Dovilla, R-Berea, received $2,500  from Dee Haslam and Jimmy Haslam on Aug. 16, 2024, in two separate donations worth $1,250.
There are twenty-one Republicans on the House Finance Committee. Including Dovilla, four have accepted direct contributions from the Haslams:

Rep. Gayle Manning, R-North Ridgeville: $2,500
Rep.  Sharon Ray, R-Wadsworth: $2,500
Rep. Jamie Callender, R-Concord: $2,500

Manning’s donation was accepted most recently, on Sept. 13, while Dovilla’s was delivered on Aug. 16. 
Of the nine Republicans on the House Arts, Athletics and Tourism Committee, Committee Chair Melanie Miller, R-Ashland, and Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, have accepted direct contributions from the Haslams.  Miller was given $1,250 on Aug. 19 last year by Jimmy Haslam, and Rep. Thomas received $2,500 from Jimmy and Dee on the same date. 
“Campaign contributions do not influence my policy decisions,” replied Rep. Miller in an email. 
Ohio Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, has voiced skepticism about the Haslams’  proposal, saying “I’m not in favor of something that would just simply be a handout. There would have to be an ability to be paid back.” 
McColley received $30,999 from Jimmy and Dee Haslam last year, according to campaign finance reports. 
Sen. Jerry Cirino, R-Kirkland, was appointed Senate Finance Committee Chair in January. 
“It is imperative we are good stewards of your taxpayer dollars and make sure those funds are properly utilized,” Cirino said when given the position. “I look forward to working with my colleagues to accomplish our goals for our state’s continued prosperity and progress.”
Reports show Jimmy and Dee Haslam gave Cirino $15,000 in August of last year, and attended an event supporting Cirino on Aug. 29.
Three other Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee have received donations from Jimmy and Dee Haslam within the last year. They are:

Sen. Nathan Manning, R-North Ridgeville: $5,000
Sen. Tom Patton, R-Strongsville: $5,000
Sen. Mark Romanchuk, R-Ontario: $2,500

Democrats
Only five Democrats appeared on the list of candidates to whom the Haslams have donated. Rep.Bride Rose Sweeney, D-Westlake, is a ranking member on the House Finance Committee. She accepted $5,000 from Jimmy and Dee Haslam last year. Rep. Terrence Upchurch, D-Cleveland, serves on the Arts, Athletics and Tourism Committee. He was given $1,250 by Jimmy Haslam on Aug. 27, 2024.
Should Ohio taxpayers give Jimmy Haslam $600 million for a new Cleveland Browns stadium?

Upchurch, along with Reps. Dani Issacsohn, D-Cincinnati, and Dontavius Jarrells, D-Columbus, issued a statement calling for a pause on the stadium plan, writing, “Elected officials have a responsibility to the people we represent – not to developers, not to sports owners, but to working families.”
Three other Democrats are beneficiaries of contributions: 

House Minority Leader Allison Russo, D-Upper Arlington:$2,500
Senate Minority Leader Nickie Antonio, D-Lakewood: $2,500
Rep. Darnell Brewer, D-Cleveland: $2,500

Does money influence policy?
Common Cause Ohio Executive Director Catherine Turcer said that major donors to candidates often consider these contributions an investment in their business.
“Ohioans aren’t naive. It’s not hard to connect the dots,” she said. “The legislators are considering cuts in education and services that impact our daily life. Campaign cash is the only reason our legislators would consider corporate welfare to the tune of $600 million.”
Political activity in Ohio increasingly requires large sums of money. Last year, the pro- and anti-Issue 1 campaigns raised a combined $42,600,000 from donors and dark money groups, while $113.2 million was raised in the race for Sherrod Brown’s Senate seat, now occupied by Republican Bernie Moreno. 
Money can often be wielded to pressure politicians. The Ohio House Bill 6 scandal, which led to the incarceration of former House Speaker Larry Householder, and the Cincinnati City Hall bribery investigation are recent examples. 
Both cases involved bribery and quid pro quos — neither of which can be proven by just a campaign contribution. 
In Turcer’s view, even if donations don’t constitute bribery, campaign cash is essential to a lawmaker’s survival, and generosity from donors or corporations often hangs over their heads. 
“Campaign contributions influence public policy with a wink and a nod. The avalanche of dark money or secret money doesn’t mean that our representatives aren’t influenced by it,” she said. “It just means that it’s harder for the public to clearly identify shenanigans. The role of money in elections is so pervasive that many seeking office just think of it as just business as usual.”

Last Friday, a pair of GOP state Court of Appeals judges accepted Griffin’s ridiculous theory that sixty-five thousand registered North Carolina voters who complied with all voting rules, including providing a valid photo ID, must still nonetheless come forward and again prove their identity, or have their votes thrown out.
The ruling is a stunning assault on democracy. As Judge Tobias Hampson wrote in a long and scathing dissent, quote “changing the rules by which these lawful voters took part in our electoral process after the election to discard their otherwise valid votes – in an attempt to alter the outcome of only one race among many on the ballot – is directly counter to law, equity, and the Constitution.”
The bottom line: Hampson is right. The voters have spoken in the Riggs-Griffin contest, and this rogue ruling cannot be allowed to stand.

The Ohio Housing Trust Fund was created in 1991 and is administered by the Ohio Department of Development. It is funded by a portion of the fees collected by county recorders, with half of the fees staying with the county and the other half going back to the Ohio Housing Trust Fund — which requires at least 50% of the funds be spent in non-urban areas.

“Through the Trust Fund, it funds homeless services, home modifications and repairs for homeowners, usually individuals who are aging,” said Coalition on Homelessness and Housing in Ohio’s Executive Director Amy Riegel. “It also provides gap financing for housing development and affordable housing development across the state.” 
The House budget proposal would remove the requirement for county recorders to send the Department of Development money to reallocate the funds, making it less effective across the state.
“Each county, whatever their receipts are, that’s the funding they have, and that’s all the funding that they have,” Riegel said. “It is a significant change.”
She was surprised to see this in the House’s budget proposal. 
“When the state is able to aggregate those dollars, they are then able to put it back out into communities where it is most needed at that time, and there are not enough resources,” Riegel said. “The Trust Fund could be 10 times what it is today, and we still wouldn’t be able to solve every housing issue across the state, but it is very effective, very useful dollars. … This is a program that actually works really well, that’s very strong, and we only have the hope to continue to strengthen it.”
Ohio is lacking more than 264,000 affordable rental units, according to the 2025 Gap Report released by the National Low Income Housing Coalition and coalition on housing and homelessness. Ohioans make at least $20.81 an hour working a full-time job to be able to afford a “modest” two-bedroom apartment, according to the 2024 Out of Reach Ohio report.
Ohio House lawmakers also nixed Gov. Mike DeWine’s Ohio Housing Investment Opportunity Program in the budget that would have invested $100 million in fiscal year 2026 to help increase single and multi-family housing in rural areas. 
“That would have helped individuals build all types of homes,” Riegel said. “I know that was something that the home builders have really advocated for, so disappointing to see that not included.”
The House’s proposed version of the budget would give the Ohio Housing Finance Agency $18.9 million for fiscal year 2026 and $19.6 for fiscal year 2027, the same as DeWine’s proposal. 
The House is set to vote on its version on the budget soon. The budget will then go to the Senate before going back to DeWine’s desk where it must be signed into law by June 30.

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish only with original story.)Food assistance programs in the state would see large cuts and changes under the Ohio House’s budget plan. Meanwhile, a bipartisan pair of lawmakers are trying to prevent electronic benefit card fraud by equipping them with chip technology.
As the House released its proposed spending priorities for the next two years, its Agriculture Committee heard about plans to help Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) participants, and a rundown of the Ohioans who could be impacted by those changes.
“As a health care provider, I am acutely aware that food security is a fundamental social determinant of health,” said state Rep. Kellie Deeter, R-Norwalk.
Deeter and Rep. Tristan Rader, D-Lakewood, are co-sponsors of House Bill 163, which would enhance SNAP benefit cards with chip technology similar to that on most debit and credit cards.
According to the bill sponsors, $17 million in SNAP benefits were stolen from Ohio residents from June 2023 to January 2025. That money was reimbursed through a federal program, but that program ended in 2025.
“That means when SNAP benefits are stolen now, families will shoulder the loss,” Deeter said. “These are real Ohioans who suddenly find themselves without the means to buy groceries, through no fault of their own.”
Rader is also sponsoring a bill with Rep. Desiree Tims, D-Dayton, that would establish a state program to replace SNAP benefits for victims of electronic benefit theft, hoping to appropriate $17 million from the General Revenue Fund for that cause.
“This came through a conversation because I continue to get calls from constituents who have lost their benefits, often disabled veterans, often senior citizens, who are in a panic on how they’re going to access food because of the SNAP threat and the (electronic benefit transfer) theft,” Tims said.
In fiscal year 2022, Ohio households received $306 per month in average SNAP benefits. Households with older adults received $155 per month on average, according to research by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

In an analysis of state and federal SNAP data from fiscal year 2024, the center’s research showed that, of the nearly 1.4 million Ohio residents using SNAP, more than 43% are families with older adults or disabled individuals. That’s higher than the national rate of 37%.
Families with children make up the largest group, with more than 62% of SNAP participants falling into that category, the same as the national rate. The center also found that 35% of SNAP recipients are members of working families.
Legislators are fighting to see those benefits returned as the legislature debates cuts to hunger assistance even beyond the federal program, along with work requirements for SNAP recipients.
Ohio hunger budget
 
The SNAP work requirements in the Ohio House’s draft budget weren’t part of Gov. Mike DeWine’s executive proposal.
If the House’s version of the work requirements become law, the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services would be prohibited from “seeking, applying for, or renewing a waiver from the work requirements that apply to able-bodied adults without dependents,” budget documents say.
The Department of Job and Family Services also couldn’t implement a “federal option” to grant exemptions from SNAP work requirements, though the draft budget noted that SNAP benefits are funded by the federal government, so the work requirement doesn’t impact the state budget funds.
The House draft budget kept language from DeWine’s proposal regarding the assessment of SNAP participants who may be eligible for a work requirement waiver. The provision allows the state job and family services agency to refer participants in SNAP and the Ohio Works First programs who are “claiming a mental or physical illness or impairment” to the Opportunities for Ohioans with Disabilities office for “vocational rehabilitation assessment and support.”
Unless Ohioans are unable to meet minimum work requirements, as determined by the disability agency, they would be required to meet work requirements to receive benefits, according to the proposal.
The House budget also would require recipients to report “changes in circumstances that may affect eligibility for continued receipt of benefits” within 30 days of the change, a provision that also bars the job and family services department from “implementing simplified or quarterly reporting procedures for households receiving SNAP benefits.”
Food fight
Advocates for the hungry have said increased support for SNAP benefits is critical for Ohioans who need food assistance, especially as the current SNAP levels often need to be supplemented by food banks and other programs.
“The relationship between food banking and public assistance, particularly … SNAP, is relatively straightforward: SNAP provides more meals than we ever could,” said Hope Lane-Gavin, director of nutrition policy and programs for the Ohio Association of Food Banks, in testimony supporting another piece of anti-fraud legislation, a Senate resolution to urge Congress to restore stolen SNAP benefits.
Lane-Gavin also said significant changes in SNAP can affect “everything from the benefit allotment itself to changes in accessibility in the program’s application and interview.” Those changes are felt throughout the food assistance system, including food banks, she said.
“I offer that to say, even when the program is working as intended, for many Ohio families receiving SNAP benefits, the benefit itself is woefully inadequate.”
Food banks may have to brace for more cuts, as the House’s proposal chopped funding allotted to the Children’s Hunger Alliance via Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) dollars. DeWine’s executive proposal maintained the current funding of $7.5 million over the next two years, but the House proposal slashes it to just $3 million.
The alliance said in a statement that the reduction would cut 2.8 million meals throughout the state, and double the number of schools on a waitlist to participate in alliance programs.
“Across Ohio’s 32 Appalachian counties, children bear the brunt of hunger, and we provide food at 338 sites,” alliance president and CEO Michelle Brown wrote in a call-to-action email sent on Thursday. “In Columbiana and Athens counties alone, this cut represents about 150,000 meals.”
The Ohio Association of Foodbanks has previously pleaded with legislators to help, because the organization couldn’t afford to provide for another increase in hungry families in the state. Federal-level cuts could also be looming.
The House’s version of the budget took up DeWine’s proposal to earmark $44.1 million in TANF funds over the next two years for the association. The governor specified those funds should be used not only to purchase and distribute food, but also for SNAP outreach, along with summer meal programs, free tax filing services and “capacity building equipment.”
The budget also includes a proposal for a sub-grant agreement with the food banks association to distribute food to low-income families and support “transportation of meals for the Governor’s Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives Innovative Summer Meals program.”
Through the agreement, the association would be required to purchase food for state food programs, support a capacity-building grant program and pay for equipment for “partner agencies that is needed to increase their capacity to serve more families eligible under the TANF program.”
The Ohio Senate will draft its own budget before the House and Senate drafts can be combined and sent to the governor. The deadline for approval the state budget is June 30.

They filled the streets in Topeka, in Lawrence, in Wichita, in Kansas City and elsewhere. They marched, they chanted, they waved signs. They spoke out loudly against the unprecedented authoritarian threat emanating from Washington, D.C., where President Donald Trump and Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency have mangled constructional norms.
These thousands of Kansans showed, over the course of one inspirational day, that Americans will not roll over and accept a would-be dictator. For those who have hesitated to speak, or felt reluctant to share opinions, let these protesters inspire you.
Free speech will only die if we let it.
That same day, Kansas Reflector staff members appeared for a town hall at the Lawrence Public Library, sponsored by the Women for Kansas of Lawrence/Douglas County. Nearly 70 folks attended, many coming straight from the protest. While I could sense optimism and enthusiasm from the crowd, a dark river of fear still flowed beneath the surface. Not everyone in the United States, or Kansas, can count on their safety these days.
We have watched the government snatch students from the streets. We have seen visas and green cards rescinded on a whim. And those who previously wouldn’t have thought twice about traveling to or from the United States must now weigh the potential risks of doing so.

As columnist Eric Thomas wrote Friday, this complicates matters for those of us who work as journalists or train would-be journalists. Certain subjects — the Israel-Hamas war — and certain categories of people — immigrants, students, professors — have been targeted by the D.C. cartel. I couldn’t in good conscience tell a student on a visa from the Middle East to write about pro-Palestinian protests. As a journalist I would have to weigh carefully telling the story of an immigrant who might be the target of a deportation order.
In some situations, the risk might be worth it. But I wouldn’t want to make that decision for anyone.
As I told the crowd at the Lawrence library, this puts responsibility on the rest of us. My family has lived in the United States for generations. I’m still, as far as I know, a white male. That doesn’t mean I should take comfort in the threats emanating from our nation’s capital. It means that I — and others like me — have a greater responsibility to speak in support of those under threat.
Not that you would know from the lousy examples set by those in high places.
An epidemic of spinelessness has spread throughout this country’s power centers. You can hardly visit the website of a news organization without reading headlines like “‘The Terror Is Real’: An Appalled Tech Industry Is Scared to Criticize Elon Musk” or “Law firms refuse to represent Trump opponents in the wake of his attacks.” Closer to home, we have this one from yours truly: “Trump’s tariffs will wreck Kansas economy. Gutless wonders at the Statehouse won’t even protest.”



What do they fear? A mean tweet from a real estate developer? Primary election challengers? Losing a few dollars?



Our nation’s elites have picked cowering over courage.
What do the Saturday crowds prove? They proved that Americans have decided en masse to solve the collective action problem posed by the Trump administration. That means that while it’s in everyone’s best interests to resist, doing so individually carries too much perceived risk. So folks worked together.
Crowd of energized Kansans carrying homemade signs and showing their refusal to be cowed by one man in the Oval Office should give us all hope. Democrats, independents and, yes, Republicans should all cheer the use of peaceful, nonviolent protest (as covered by the First Amendment of the Constitution we all revere). We don’t want the alternative.
Most of all, though, this uprising should stiffen the spine and set the jaws of those who previously feared to speak. Your fellow Americans are worth it. Responsive government is worth it. The Constitution is worth it. Free speech is worth it.
Freedom is worth it.

When presidents try to make big changes through executive orders, they often hit a roadblock: A single federal judge, whether located in Seattle or Miami or anywhere in between, can stop these policies across the entire country.
These court orders have increasingly become a political battleground, increasingly sought by both Republicans and Democrats to fight presidential policies they oppose.
This explains why the Trump administration recently asked the Supreme Court to limit judges’ power to issue what legal experts call “nationwide preliminary injunctions.” Congress also held hearings on curtailing judges’ ability to issue the injunctions.
But what exactly are these injunctions, and why do they matter to everyday Americans?
 Immediate, irreparable harm

When the government creates a policy that might violate the Constitution or federal law, affected people can sue in federal court to stop it. While these lawsuits work their way through the courts – a process that often takes years – judges can issue what are called “preliminary injunctions” to temporarily pause the policy if they determine it might cause immediate, irreparable harm.
A “nationwide” injunction – sometimes called a “universal” injunction – goes further by stopping the policy for everyone across the country, not just for the people who filed the lawsuit.
Importantly, these injunctions are designed to be temporary. They merely preserve the status quo until courts can fully examine the case’s merits. But in practice, litigation proceeds so slowly that executive actions blocked by the courts often expire when successor administrations abandon the policies.
 More executive orders, more injunctions

Nationwide injunctions aren’t new, but several things have made them more contentious recently.
First, since a closely divided and polarized Congress rarely passes major legislation anymore, presidents rely more on executive orders to get substantive things done. This creates more opportunities to challenge presidential actions in court.
Second, lawyers who want to challenge these orders have gotten better at “judge shopping” – filing cases in districts where they’re likely to get judges who agree with their client’s views.
Third, with growing political division, both parties aim to use these injunctions more aggressively whenever the other party controls the White House.
 Affecting real people

These legal fights have tangible consequences for millions of Americans.
Take DACA, the common name for the program formally called Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which protects about 500,000 young immigrants from deportation. For more than 10 years, these young immigrants, known as “Dreamers,” have faced constant uncertainty.
That’s because, when President Barack Obama created DACA in 2012 and sought to expand it via executive order in 2015, a Texas judge blocked the expansion with a nationwide injunction. When Trump tried to end DACA, judges in California, New York and Washington, D.C. blocked that move. The program, and the legal challenges to it, continued under President Joe Biden. Now, the second Trump administration faces continued legal challenges over the constitutionality of the DACA program.
More recently, judges have used nationwide injunctions to block several Donald Trump policies. Three different courts stopped the president’s attempt to deny citizenship to babies born to mothers who lack legal permanent residency in the United States. Judges have also temporarily blocked Trump’s efforts to ban transgender people from serving in the military and to freeze some federal funding for a variety of programs.
While much of the current debate focuses on presidential policies, nationwide injunctions have also blocked congressional legislation.
The Corporate Transparency Act, passed in 2021 and originally scheduled to go into effect in 2024, combats financial crimes by requiring businesses to disclose their true owners to the government. A Texas judge blocked this law in 2024 after gun stores challenged it.
In early 2025, the Supreme Court allowed the law to take effect, but the Trump administration announced it simply wouldn’t enforce it – showing how these legal battles can become political power struggles.
 Too much power or necessary protection?

Some critics say nationwide injunctions give too much power to a single judge. If lawyers can pick which judges hear their cases, this raises serious questions about fairness.
Supporters argue that these injunctions protect important rights. For example, without nationwide injunctions in the citizenship cases, babies born to mothers without legal permanent residency would be American citizens in some states but not others – an impossible situation.
Congress is considering legislation to limit judges’ ability to grant nationwide injunctions.
The Trump administration has also tried to make it expensive and difficult to challenge its policies in court. In March 2025, Trump ordered government lawyers to demand large cash deposits – called “security bonds” – from anyone seeking an injunction. Though these bonds are already part of existing court rules, judges usually set them at just a few hundred dollars or waive them entirely when people raise constitutional concerns.
Under the new policy, critics worry that “plaintiffs who sue the government could be forced to put up enormous sums of money in order to proceed with their cases.”
Another way to address the concerns about a single judge blocking government action would be to require a three-judge panel to hear cases involving nationwide injunctions, requiring at least two of them to agree. This is similar to how courts handled major civil rights cases in the 1950s and 1960s.
My research on this topic suggests that three judges working together would be less likely to make partisan decisions, while still being able to protect constitutional rights when necessary. Today’s technology also makes it easier for judges in different locations to work together than it was decades ago.
As the Supreme Court weighs in on this debate, the outcome will affect how presidents can implement policies and how much power individual judges have to stop them. Though it might seem like a technical legal issue, it will shape how government works for years to come – as well as the lives of those who live in the U.S.

Anna Pesek saw a federal program supporting local food purchases as much more than a boost to her Iowa pork and poultry farm.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture grant program that allowed schools and food banks to buy fresh products from small farms helped her forge new business relationships. It allowed her to spend more with local feed mills and butchers, and was starting to build a stronger supply chain of local foods.
But now that the Trump administration has yanked the funding, she worries that rural economic boost might end too.
“With the razor-thin margins on both sides, those partnerships are just really hard, if not impossible, to sustain,” she said.
The co-owner of Over the Moon Farm, Pesek said her operation was never entirely reliant on the local food programs; it represented about 10% of her business. While she knew the federal money wouldn’t last forever, she was planning on the funding lasting through 2028 — but then the Trump administration last month nixed more than $1 billion for local food programs.
The federally funded Local Food Purchase Assistance and the Local Food for Schools programs, both begun during the pandemic, focused on small, local farms in aims of building stronger domestic food supply chains. Grants allowed schools and food banks to buy meat, dairy and produce from small farms — including many healthy products that are often too expensive for those institutions.
USDA’s local food programs specifically aided some of the nation’s most disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, including newcomers, small farmers and those who have faced racial discrimination.
Federal cuts squeeze already-struggling food banks, school lunch programs

The local food programs were initially funded by 2021’s American Rescue Plan Act but were later expanded by the Biden administration. The Trump administration, though, has cut the funding that went to thousands of small farms, saying that it’s instead “prioritizing stable, proven solutions that deliver lasting impact.”
Pesek noted that the federal government has subsidized commodity agriculture like corn and soybeans for more than a century.
“It’s not a novel idea, right? This is how the relationship between the federal government and farmers has looked,” she said. “And so all this program did was allocate some of the funds to go to different kinds of farmers versus just commodity farmers.”
Just after cutting the local food programs, USDA announced it was expediting $10 billion in direct payments to commodity farmers through the Emergency Commodity Assistance Program, which helps farmers offset high input prices and low sale prices for crops. The White House is reportedly considering billions more in farm subsidies as President Donald Trump escalates global trade wars.
Andy Ollove, food access program director at Fresh Approach, a California nonprofit that works on building a healthier and more resilient food system, said the government’s long-standing farm subsidies flow to some of the nation’s biggest operators. Conversely, the local food programs benefited small farmers and communities directly.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
“The economic multiplier to this program just seems way more impactful than the traditional subsidy model of the USDA that the administration is continuing to invest in,” he said. “It’s just a giveaway.”
Fresh Approach has helped administer the food bank program in California. While implementation delays mean farmers won’t lose access to the program as quickly as in other states, he expects elimination of the program to put small farmers out of business across the country.
Some states have launched their own local food programs, but nothing on the scale of the federal investment. That’s left advocates for small farmers, local foods and food banks pushing for reinstatement of the federal program or getting it included in the next round of farm bill negotiations, when Congress outlines a five- or six-year spending plan for the nation’s food policy and agriculture sector.
Ollove expects philanthropists will fund parts of California’s program after federal money is depleted. But it won’t have the same reach.
“I do feel confident that these types of programs will continue in California … sporadically and piecemeal,” he said. “But not in the way that we’re administering it, in a way that I think is changing a lot of things and improving the food system.”
 A mixed response from states

The noncompetitive USDA local food grants allowed many new farmers to break into markets. And the aid for food hubs, which link small producers to larger markets, helped farmers distribute products to schools and food banks.
In Wisconsin, for example, more than half of the nearly 300 farmers who benefited from the food bank program were early career farmers, according to state officials.
In Illinois, the state prioritized funds toward socially disadvantaged farmers, such as those who have faced racial or ethnic prejudice.
“Attacking this program was really an attack on Illinois’ most vulnerable, whether it’s a socially disadvantaged farmer or the food recipient,” said Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture.
Her department administered the federal food bank program, which helped beginning farmers get their businesses off the ground.
“A lot of these farmers, they’re living their dreams,” she said. “They are living their goals because of this program.”
Illinois had been planning on nearly $15 million from the next round of funding for the food bank program. Jones said farmers already had begun planning and spending on seeds and equipment.










A lot of these farmers, they're living their dreams.


– Kristi Jones, deputy director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture


“You just don’t put something on the ground and have the product the next day,” she said. “ … So that uncertainty was incredibly challenging for farmers who already deal with enough uncertainty.”
Democratic leaders have bashed the Trump administration’s decision: Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker, for example, called it “a slap in the face to Illinois farmers and the communities they feed.”
But conservative leaders in other states have downplayed the cuts.
In Texas, Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller characterized USDA’s decision as “a reassessment.”
He said the state was not dependent on the federal funds and would continue its Farm to School and Farm to Food Bank programs, which encourage the local purchase of Texas agricultural products.
“There’s always room for refinement, and we may see a revised version of the policy down the road that is even better for agriculture producers,” he said in a statement last month.
Texas funds programs to help distribute excess food to schools, food banks and charities. But it does not have a grant program like USDA’s to help those organizations purchase local food, said Marshall Webb, spokesperson for the state agriculture department.
Iowa’s agriculture department recently started its own local food program.
The Choose Iowa program has made about $300,000 available to support local food purchases — though the state lost out on about $11.3 million because of the federal cuts.
Don McDowell, spokesperson for the Iowa Department of Agriculture & Land Stewardship, said the agency would continue to ask lawmakers to expand funding for the Choose Iowa program.
“Programs designed to forge relationships between Iowa farmers, food hubs, food banks and schools are important to our farmers and communities,” he said.
Iowa Farmers Union President Aaron Heley Lehman said his organization, which represents family farmers and ranchers, would like to see the state step in to fill the void.
“But we don’t anticipate that that’s going to be an easy thing for the state of Iowa to do,” he said. “So not only is it local farmers that are feeling like they’ve had the rug pulled out from underneath them, but the state of Iowa has, too.”
 Creating a new food system

In Southern California, Dickinson Family Farms has worked to gather produce from dozens of small farms across the region, allowing even the smallest operators without distribution capabilities to sell to local food banks.
Democrats and Republicans take on soda, but they’re using different tactics

Andrew Dickinson, who owns the farm with his father, said the federal local food program also helped reduce food waste. Farmers were able to get fair market prices for vegetables with cosmetic damage or fruits deemed too small or large for grocery store shelves.
Dickinson said the federal program has provided a reliable marketplace for small operators that otherwise depend on more inconsistent sales streams like farmers markets.
“It will create a vacuum,” he said.
About 60 miles east of Los Angeles, sixth-generation farmer Anna Knight said the federal funds were much more than a handout to farmers. To her, they were about creating a new kind of food system.
She said supporting local producers creates more supply chain resilience — something many people didn’t appreciate until the pandemic.
“We don’t want to go back to that world,” she said. “When we invest in our local food system, we’re really investing on onshoring our food production system, on making new food systems local and increasing their resiliency in moments of crisis.”
Old Grove Orange, her California farm, has been supplying citrus to some local school systems for years. But she said the federal funds were the “single biggest changemaker” for pushing schools to buy local for the first time.
To her, that’s key in promoting lifelong healthy eating: Local produce like her freshly picked oranges pack more of a nutritional punch and just taste better than produce that takes weeks to ship from abroad.
“When you are giving a child a delicious piece of fruit, you are really cultivating their palate for life,” she said. “You are setting this expectation of what a fruit is supposed to taste like, and you are sparking this love for fruits and vegetables for the rest of their life.”
Knight said the nation doesn’t have to choose between big and small farms. But small farms are vanishing all around her.
“This is a ticking bomb,” she said. “The clock is running out if we don’t really find a way to help make these small, medium-sized farms sustainable.”

(Getty Images)We “celebrated” April Fools last week, pranking, getting pranked or observing from a safe distance. I once wrote an April Fools column that ended up passed around on the floor of the Nebraska Legislature, prompted an angry call from the head of the Nebraska School Administrators Association and caused four subscribers to the Grand Island Independent to cancel their subscriptions. 
Geesh, who knew? I retired from the prankster game after that folderol.
Few, however, know that April 2, the day after our annual descent into tomfoolery is known as International Fact-Checking Day. The brainchild of the International Fact-Checking Network, which supports more than 170 fact-checking organizations, International Fact-Checking Day is held each year to remind us of the critical nature of getting the facts right, supporting honest public discourse, invalidating myths and underscoring accountability in journalism.
Libraries matter
Fact-checking has become a life preserver in today’s ocean of disinformation where we often find ourselves treading water to stay informed and afloat. In the modern maze one must navigate to find and embrace the truth, one place remains a bulwark against the propagandists: the library.
But now perhaps, librarians may be hobbled in their work. Among the president’s recent barrage of executive orders (109 as of April 1, including going after of all places, the Smithsonian) is the gutting of the small agency that supports American libraries and museums. The entire staff at the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) is on paid administrative leave, which may disproportionately affect small rural libraries and museums.
Nebraska has benefited from the IMLS. In an interview with The Conversation, Devon Akron, Director of the MSU Museum at Michigan State University said that in 2019 the IMLS awarded funds to libraries in Nebraska to support economic development in 30 rural communities. “The project created rotating “innovation studios” in local libraries and provided residents with tools, instructional materials and programming to foster entrepreneurship and creativity. The IMLS supports libraries of all types — public, academic, school and research … It is the only federal agency dedicated to sustaining the entire museum and library ecosystem in the United States.”
The American Library Association said the executive order “would decimate services such as early literacy development and reading programs, high-speed internet access, employment assistance, homework and research resources and accessible reading materials.” Its own internal research indicated that “89 percent of voters and 92 percent of parents believe local public libraries have an important role to play in communities.”
Trump administration defends cuts
The Trump administration said the cuts would “strengthen IMLS’s ability to serve the American people with integrity and purpose. President Trump was given a clear mandate by the American people, and his executive order delivers on that by reducing federal bureaucracy. This restructure is a necessary step to fulfill that order and ensure hard-earned tax dollars are not diverted to discriminatory DEI initiatives or divisive, anti-American programming in our cultural institutions.”
Mandate? At 49.81 percent of the vote? Seriously? And again with the DEI? What exactly was the “anti-Americanism” or “discrimination” or any other divisive behavior? Libraries and museums are by design filled with diversity in ideas, culture and art. They are at their best when they provide the truth, fire our imaginations, build communities and remain a repository of exploration and wonder for all ages, whether through a book, a computer screen, a class or the myriad of programs you can find.
Full disclosure: I am a lifelong fan of libraries, starting with the Carnegie Library in Grand Island where I checked out my first book as a little guy and where I loved spending time among the stacks of titles, the quiet like a friend, the musty smell of something old and important. I often spent time at the Fairfax Branch of the Los Angeles City Library during my decade in the City of Angels, browsing, reading and writing. And when I moved to Lincoln last fall, my first stop — before a new driver’s license or a utility account or a new dentist — was the library near my home for a new card.
My own biases aside, I’ve yet to see how cutting a small agency that supports libraries and museums could benefit Americans.
By the way, last Friday was National Tell a Lie Day, a fitting bookend to the week. But if you want to be sure your friend or coworker or state senator or congressman or president is telling the truth, I suppose you have a few options: Google, Facebook, TikTok, etc.
Or the one you can count on: a library.",https://nebraskaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/library-books-3.jpeg,,,2025-04-07 04:58:09.658431

Mia Love and offer their condolences to her family. 
Love is survived by an extensive family including her husband Jason, daughters Abigale and Alessa, and son Peyton, who greeted guests at the Capitol as Love lay in state.
Love’s career was marked by important firsts, including being the first Black woman elected as mayor in Utah, when she was chosen to lead Saratoga Springs, and as the first Black Utahn elected to Congress. When she took her place in the U.S. House, she was the first Black Republican congresswoman.
She died March 23 at the age of 49 after battling a rare form of brain cancer.

As they shared memories of Love on Sunday, some who came to honor her recalled her energy for her work and her commitment to Utahns.
“Mia was, I think, groundbreaking in a number of different ways. She had the energy to do the job, but she wanted to do it in a way that made a difference to people and that meant representing all the people,” said Richard Piatt, Love’s former communications director. “She would meet with anyone that wanted to meet with her, and she made friends with a lot of people. I think that that’s probably one of her biggest legacies is that she didn’t mind taking on issues that she knew mattered to Utah, and mattered for the 4th District.”
Others described Love’s knack for connecting with those she met and her dedication to service.
“If you talk to just about anybody here, they will tell you that they were best friends with Mia. She was everybody’s best friend,” said DeLaina Tonks, a longtime friend of Love. “Her dad told her ‘You must give back.’ That was his thing that he told her after coming to the states from Haiti, and she has taken that to heart. That’s what she taught her children, it’s what she taught my children, it’s what she taught all of her friends is that we’re here to make a difference, to change the world and to make the world a better place.”
Love will be remembered in funeral services Monday at 10 a.m. at The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints’ Institute building at the University of Utah. A live stream can be viewed on YouTube.

But with the Kentucky River expected to crest at a record level of 49.5 feet following several days of unrelenting rain, her family and friends worked Sunday afternoon to move couches, tables and more from the home along Murray Street.
Just a couple houses over, the swollen river had already partially submerged the homes of people Bobbitt, 64, says she knows from growing up together. The river’s expected crest Monday morning would beat the previous record by a foot if realized, according to a projection by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
“I just hate that all these people down here — we grew up with them,” Bobbitt said. “I just pray for our community.”

The state capital of Frankfort is one of a number of communities across Kentucky grappling with a deluge of flash flooding from torrential rainfall over the past several days — more than a foot of rain in some parts of the state — that’s now caused rivers to rise leading to evacuations along the Kentucky River in Frankfort and in the Pendleton County cities of Falmouth and Butler along the Licking River. 
In Carroll County, the deputy judge-executive Sunday afternoon ordered the mandatory evacuation of some areas because of a release of water from gates on Dix Dam along the Kentucky River. Robb Adams, the mayor of the Carroll County seat of Carrollton, in a livestreamed video on Facebook said the water release was planned.
Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear closed all state offices Monday given that flooding is limiting the available water supply in Frankfort, and he urged Frankfort residents to conserve water. The city utility Frankfort Plant Board in a Sunday morning Facebook post wrote electrical equipment used to pump water from the river had to be turned off due to the flooding and that the city was relying on water storage tanks.

The widespread flooding across Central and Western Kentucky has caused numerous roadway closures and has, so far, killed two people: a nine-year-old child was swept away by floodwaters in Frankfort and a Nelson County man was found submerged in his car. 
Ben Bramble, a 21-year-old lifelong resident of Frankfort, was moving furniture Sunday afternoon out of his rental duplex in the rain along East 3rd Street with the help of his family.

With the expected record river crest and floodwaters surrounding homes just a couple blocks away, he wasn’t sure what he will come back to when the river finally recedes. Bramble said flooding is a “recurring problem” for the state. But no matter how many floods you’ve experienced, there’s nothing to be done once you’ve been told to evacuate. 
“It’s going to be higher than we could ever have thought,” Bramble said. “I really just hope that we can come back to our house and have it still here.”
