RUTLAND CITY — On a freezing Monday morning, around six dozen people were forced out of their Sheldon Towers apartments after an isolated stove top fire set off the sprinkler system, causing significant water damage throughout the building.
The Rutland City Fire Department responded to the scene Monday morning around 11 am, and found the sprinkler system extinguished the fire on the sixth floor, said Fire Department Chief William Lovett. The tenant of the unit with the fire had some smoke inhalation, but otherwise no one was harmed by the fire, Lovett said. 
“We had all of our crews come in, and then we also asked the Rutland Town Fire (Department) to come in so that we could help limit the amount of damage done to the building and get the people out of the building safely,” Lovett said. 
Sheldon Towers is a 10-story building with 74 units, owned and managed by Rutland Housing Authority. The building, located near the intersection of Route 7 and Route 4 in Rutland City, primarily serves older adults and people with disabilities.
Housing Authority’s executive director and CEO Kevin Loso said 73 people were displaced on Monday, and the Authority has been working to find residents emergency motel housing if they were not able to stay with family or friends. The Authority also helped residents gain access to medications and shelter for pets. 
“We secured housing for everyone last night that needed it,” Loso said. “We were able to secure the necessary resources to ensure that immediate needs were met.”
While no one was harmed, Loso said a few residents were brought to the Rutland Regional Medical Center due to anxiety from the event or pre-existing medical conditions. 
Loso said he hopes the Authority will get the go-ahead to open up 50 units by the end of the day Tuesday, but at least 18 units have significant electrical damage, and some units may need to be cleared out for remediation.
A local firm called G.W. Savage is conducting the water damage assessment and restoration work, Loso said. 
The water damage primarily impacted the units from the sixth floor down to the second floor, Loso said. But, the Authority cannot reenergize housing units until the electrical damage is fully assessed by the Division of Fire Safety, Building Inspector and the Authority’s electrician, he said.
The Rutland Area community mobilization effort was “extraordinary,” Loso said. 
Along with the local fire departments and Rutland City’s Emergency Management Services’ response, the American Red Cross and the Open Door Mission help provide “food and blankets and everything else that was needed in order to get people through yesterday,” Loso said.

Jerry Laktonen is a fisherman and boatbuilder who began carving in his 40s and has become a leading voice in the revival of Alutiiq carving traditions. His masks and ceremonial paddles are celebrated nationally, and his colorful, powerful works greet visitors at the Smithsonian’s National Museum of the American Indian. His works  have earned first-place awards at the Santa Fe Indian Market, the Heard Museum Fair in Phoenix, and other major Indigenous art shows across the country.
Most recently, he has also won the Distinguished Artist Award as part of the Rasmuson Foundation’s Individual Artist Awards program. The award, which includes a $50,000 grant, honors his lifetime of creative excellence and cultural leadership, the foundation’s highest recognition for an Alaskan artist.

This recognition shines a light on the broader role of Alaska Native artists: sustaining Indigenous identity, mentoring the next generation and contributing significantly to Alaska’s economy. Traditional Native artists are central to cultural revitalization and the strength of Alaska’s Indigenous communities. Laktonen’s carvings include ceremonial Alutiiq paddles and expressive masks.
“Jerry Laktonen brings intention and integrity to every piece he creates,” said Gretchen Guess, president and Chief Executive Officer of Rasmuson Foundation. “He has worked tirelessly to ensure Alaska Native artists are recognized and respected. His commitment to authenticity has left a lasting mark on both his community and the field. Artists like Jerry Laktonen remind us that culture is not only preserved. It is lived, shared, and continually reimagined,” added Guess.
What does it mean to win this award?
A self-taught artist who began carving in his mid 40s, Laktonen turned to art after the Exxon Valdez oil spill disrupted his fishing livelihood to express his creativity in a new way.

“When I first started it out at ground zero, not having a lot of money and having to make something with my hands in order to have some security to just live and to not be stressed out all the time,” Laktonen told ICT. “I had to stick my neck out quite a bit to increase my visibility and give myself more of a chance of having success.”
A move to Washington state from Alaska helped his transition.
“That was when I moved south to Washington state and made it easier for me to be able to go to major shows in the major markets in the United States,” Laktonen said. “That was often done with an awful lot of hope involved because I didn’t have any money to be able to do anything extra except just make something that I thought I could sell and also take care of my other needs.”

But desperation and necessity are often at the forefront of invention.

“That stress actually brought out something in me that I didn’t know I had and that was resourcefulness or maybe talent,” Laktonen said. “I was surprised at what I was able to come up with as far as ideas and ways of expressing what I wanted to express in my culture.”
Laktonen says he felt  blessed to learn about carvings, the innovation of the people that came before, which inspired his own creativity.
In trying to create his own style of the traditional Alutiiq carving art form, he ran into creative roadblocks that were partly mental and partly from the art world.
“There was always the danger of misrepresenting what was known about from the past,“ Laktonen says, “I wanted to bring out the elements of what I was available a long time ago and express it without manipulating it too much. I think almost without any doubt I did go a little bit too far sometimes, but that was a little bit of what I thought was my duty as an expressive artist.”

He says that there was a lot going on between survival and his personal expression creating a balancing act to stay alive.
“Maybe getting the award affirmed to me that I may have been on the right track,” Laktonen says. “I don’t know, but with the way things have been going I’m optimistic.”
After many years of working as an artist, the recent award money will allow him to produce work in a more sustainable way that allows for rest.
“As far as volume of work my hope is that I can decline in volume but increase my expressiveness,” he says “I’m looking forward to what might happen now being creative and not feeling the pressure as much. I hope that I was able to express what I thought were the elements of the Alutiiq culture, at least as I saw it.”
Looking over his body of work Laktonen says he is both impressed but a little bit disappointed he wasn’t able to put more energy into it at times. He says when he looks back at his work he thinks it was “fantastic” and  believes carving and making artwork is a good way for people to understand themselves and learn what’s going on inside of their own head.
“I will continue to make my usual masks and paddles,” Laktonen says “And try and make them exceptional and spend more time on them because I won’t be pressured to try and make money to stay above water.”

Clements’ last day will be Dec. 31. The college’s governing board is expected to appoint Provost Bob Jones as interim president as it searches for a new leader.
“Serving Clemson University has been one of the greatest privileges of my life. I am deeply grateful for the trust and friendship you have shown me and my family over the years,” Clements wrote in a letter that went out to students and employees Tuesday. “After much consideration and prayer, I have come to the conclusion that it is time for me to step aside and allow the University to begin its next chapter.”
Clements’ retirement comes a year after the board approved him for a contract extension through 2031. He is 61 years old.
As president, Clements’ total compensation is $1.5 million.
Before Clemson hired Clements, he spent about five years as president of West Virginia University. Now, with 17 years of university leadership on his resume, Clements said he is ready to spend more time with family.
“There comes a time when health and family must take precedence,” Clements said. “Clemson has been my home and passion, yet my greatest love is for my wife, Beth, and our children and grandchildren. Life moves quickly, and I don’t want to miss what truly matters – the major milestones and the quiet, everyday joys.”
In his letter, Clements touted university accomplishments, including Clemson’s designation as a top-tier research university, setting records for the number of applications submitted by prospective students hoping to gain admittance and football championships.
“President Clements has been more than a leader — he has been a mentor, a friend and an advocate for every member of the Clemson Family,” board chairwoman Kim Wilkerson said in a statement. “While we will certainly miss his guidance and enthusiasm, we also deeply respect and understand his decision to focus on his priorities.”
Wilkerson said the board plans to start the search process immediately and she hopes the board can select the college’s 16th president in time for the fall 2026 semester.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/President-Jim-Clements_028a_AJ-1-scaled-e1765310252375-1024x702.jpg,,,2025-12-09 15:56:55.807754

[…],"Wind turbines generate electricity at the Block Island Wind Farm in 2022 near Block Island, Rhode Island. (Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)A federal judge on Monday agreed with more than a dozen states that early actions from the Trump administration to halt offshore wind development were unlawful. 
On day one of his second term President Donald Trump issued an executive order that froze permitting for offshore wind and asked for a federal review of the process. That order was challenged in court by seventeen states, including Maine, and Washington, D.C. 
The states argued they would be harmed by the pause because of the investments their governments had already made into wind developments and the potential to jeopardize future energy supply. 
Judge Patti B. Saris of the Massachusetts U.S. District Court said the states provided “ample evidence” showing that they would face negative consequences from the executive order.. 
In a statement Tuesday, Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey said he was grateful the court agreed that the Trump administration overstepped with the executive order. 
“Whatever the federal administration’s position is on wind power, it does not have the right to arbitrarily ban development of this sustainable energy resource,” Frey said, adding that he and other attorneys general will continue to work to hold the federal government accountable.
Developing offshore wind as a power source has been at the crux of Maine’s clean energy and climate goals, though that planning has had several fits and starts. 
In 2010, the state worked on a $120 million offshore wind pilot project that never came to fruition. But a decade later, Gov. Janet Mills signed a law that not only pumped new life into the effort, but did so with high labor and environmental standards, which she said would create quality jobs while building the infrastructure to produce three gigawatts of low emission energy — enough to power between 675,000 and 900,000 homes — by the end of 2040.
Last year, the state announced its preference to build a new port on Sears Island to support the budding industry, and the Maine Legislature took efforts to protect those plans. Under the Biden administration, the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the agency within the U.S. Department of Interior responsible for managing energy resources on the outer shelf, outlined eight lease areas off the coast of Maine, Massachusetts and New Hampshire for wind development. 
But following Trump’s executive order, one of the project’s key developers paused talks in April, citing “recent shifts in the energy landscape.”
Republican legislators have thanked Trump for the executive order freezing permitting and asked him to go a step further to revoke existing leases and permits in the Gulf of Maine.
They argue offshore wind would put Maine’s fishing industry at risk. However, the lease areas avoid the vital fishing area known as Lobster Management Area 1, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Jared Golden introduced legislation to codify those protections into federal law.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/GettyImages-1407548865-2048x1349-1-1024x675.jpg,,,2025-12-09 15:56:55.807754

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso/New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey’s Supreme Court declined to take up a case that challenged a state law barring candidates from running under the banner of more than one party, ending efforts to overturn the more than a century-old ban through the courts.
The Moderate Party had argued that the state’s ban on fusion voting, which allows candidates to appear on a ballot multiple times on different parties’ tickets, ran afoul of rights to free speech, association, assembly, and equal protection guaranteed by the New Jersey Constitution.
Supporters of fusion voting, which is allowed in New York, have argued that the state’s ban on the practice deliberately excludes “new ideas and new parties from the political marketplace.” 
The party sued after Secretary of State Tahesha Way declined to list then-Rep. Tom Malinowski as its nominee for the 2022 general election. Malinowski was then the 7th Congressional District’s Democratic nominee, and state law barred him from also running as the Moderate Party’s nominee.
The U.S. Supreme Court has ruled fusion voting bans are not unconstitutional. An appellate court in February declined to depart from the higher court’s ruling, noting that language in the state’s constitution is similar enough to language in the U.S. Constitution.
The appellate judges said state interests in the administration of elections outweighed the Moderate Party’s constitutional claims. The party, the three-judge panel said, could still endorse and support its chosen candidates, but they could not place a candidate’s name on the ballot for the same office a second time.
The Supreme Court’s choice not to take up the case means that the ruling will stand.

Jeff Landry's administration has partially reversed course and decided to cut one Medicaid plan instead of two in 2026. (Photo by Michelle Liu/Verite News)Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration partially pulled back on its plan to cancel two of the state’s six Medicaid contracts with private companies that provide health insurance to hundreds of thousands of Louisiana residents. 

The Louisiana Department of Health announced Tuesday morning it would end only one of its deals with a managed care organization instead of two as originally planned.  
The state will continue to work with Aetna Better Health of Louisiana, which covers 157,000 Louisiana residents on Medicaid, despite sending notice to the company a week ago saying its contract would end Dec. 31. 
“After discussions between the State of Louisiana and Aetna Better Health of Louisiana, LDH will renew its contract with Aetna as a Medicaid Managed Care Organization (MCO),” state Medicaid Director Seth Gold wrote in a letter sent Tuesday to Aetna CEO Bridget Galatas. 
The Landry administration still plans to terminate its contract with UnitedHealthCare of Louisiana, which insures 330,700 Medicaid enrollees, at the end of month. Those who have a UnitedHealthCare plan will be reassigned to one of the five other companies offering Medicaid coverage in the next two weeks, Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said. 
The UnitedHealthCare contract would have been $4.2 billion for the 2026 calendar year. The company covers about a quarter of the 1.4 million Medicaid enrollees who are insured through a private company.

“[W}e remain committed to working with the Louisiana Department of Health through this transition,” said UnitedHealthCare spokeswoman Christina Witz in a written statement Tuesday. 
Attorney General Liz Murrill pushed the health department to end its agreement with UnitedHealthCare due to ongoing litigation she has with the company. 

In 2022 as attorney general, Landry sued UnitedHealthCare and its affiliated pharmacy benefits manager, OptumRx, for allegedly overcharging Louisiana’s Medicaid program for prescription drugs. Murrill took over that lawsuit when she succeeded the governor in the attorney general’s office in 2024. 
Murrill and Landry’s legal efforts to extract financial compensation from UnitedHealthCare recently suffered a setback. The Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal overturned a lower court ruling on Nov. 21 that had favored the state.

Just days after that court decision was released, the Landry administration halted its plans to move forward with a UnitedHealthCare contract extension for 2026. 
“They are violating the contracts and have refused to provide us with [documents] we have requested,” the attorney general wrote in a text message Monday. “United has engaged in frivolous attacks on the AGs contracting authority as well.”
Murrill said she was unavailable for an interview Tuesday because she is in Rome preparing for a human trafficking conference at the Vatican. 

The contract turnabout came as a surprise to lawmakers who had signed off on the UnitedHealthCare agreement at the urging of the Landry administration on Nov. 20, the day before the court ruling came out. 
During a nearly three-hour legislative hearing, Greenstein and health department undersecretary Drew Maranto, both Landry appointees, answered dozens of questions from lawmakers and never expressed reservations about continuing to work with UnitedHealthCare.
Greenstein even pushed back when legislators suggested during the hearing that the state reduce the number of Medicaid contracts with private companies. 
Lawmakers believe working with fewer businesses could lower the administrative costs in the Medicaid program, but Greenstein cast doubt on whether those benefits would be worth the upheaval in the program. 
“Each of the plans brings a different way of envisioning how to engage patients with certain medical complexities,” Greenstein told legislators. “Patients don’t generally switch their health plan very often.”
His remarks are likely why several lawmakers, reached Monday, said they were blindsided when they discovered the health department had canceled the contract extensions. The governor and the health department didn’t give legislators advance notice before they reversed course with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Medicaid-navigators-1-1024x768.webp,,,2025-12-09 15:56:55.807754
,DC,2025-12-09 19:54:13+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,Trump administration aims to officially scrap Biden-era student loan forgiveness program,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-administration-aims-officially-scrap-biden-era-student-loan-forgiveness-program,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Department of Education announced a proposed agreement Tuesday that would permanently axe an income-driven student loan repayment plan in which more than 7 million student loan borrowers are enrolled. Under a joint proposal with seven Republican-led states that challenged the program, the department would not enroll any new borrowers in the Saving on a Valuable Education, or SAVE, plan, deny any pending applications and place borrowers currently in the plan into legally compliant repayment plans.The program, introduced in 2023 under then-President Joe Biden’s administration, was hit with legal challenges from several GOP-led states, including Missouri, and has been blocked by the courts. The initiative sought to provide lower monthly loan payments for borrowers and forgive remaining debt after a certain period of time. If a Missouri federal court approves the agreement, the department said borrowers currently enrolled in the SAVE plan “will have a limited time to select a new, legal repayment plan and begin repaying their student loans.”The agreement stems from a legal challenge to the plan brought by Missouri, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, North Dakota, Ohio and Oklahoma in 2024.A ‘deceptive scheme’In a statement alongside the announcement, Under Secretary of Education Nicholas Kent said President Donald Trump’s administration “is righting this wrong and bringing an end to this deceptive scheme.” “The law is clear: if you take out a loan, you must pay it back,” Kent added. “Thanks to the State of Missouri and other states fighting against this egregious federal overreach, American taxpayers can now rest assured they will no longer be forced to serve as collateral for illegal and irresponsible student loan policies.” Republicans argued the permissive repayment plan let borrowers off the hook at the expense of federal taxpayers.Missouri Attorney General Catherine Hanaway said in a statement Tuesday her office “fought for hardworking Americans who were being preyed upon by Biden Administration bureaucrats, and we won in court every time.” “We appreciate President Trump’s real, long-term solutions instead of illegal student loan schemes,” Hanaway added. Student advocates, though, said the agreement would place an additional burden on student borrowers already struggling with a rising cost of living.Persis Yu, deputy executive director and managing counsel at the advocacy group Protect Borrowers, blasted the settlement agreement as “pure capitulation” in a Tuesday statement. “While millions of student loan borrowers struggle amidst the worsening affordability crisis ... billionaire Education Secretary, Linda McMahon chose to strike a back-room deal with a right-wing state Attorney General and strip borrowers of the most affordable repayment plan that would help millions to stay on track with their loans while keeping a roof over their head,” Yu said. Interest accumulatingIn February, a federal appeals court upheld a lower court injunction that blocked the SAVE plan from going into effect. Borrowers under the plan were placed in an interest-free forbearance last year amid legal limbo. But borrowers’ loans in the SAVE forbearance began to accrue interest Aug. 1 — a move the department announced in July to comply with court orders. The SAVE plan was already set to be phased out by July 2028 under congressional Republicans’ tax and spending cut bill that Trump signed into law this year.",,,,2025-12-09 14:58:27.140625

Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, asks University of Louisville President Kim Schatzel about the university’s diversity, equity and inclusion program during the a meeting of the Interim Joint Committee on Education, Sept. 17, 2024. (LRC Public Information)An Oldham County Republican will renew her push to end diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in Kentucky’s public schools in the legislative session that begins next month. 
Met with support from her party and opposition from Democrats, Sen. Lindsey Tichenor, R-Smithfield, presented a draft of a bill to end DEI in K-12 schools to the Interim Joint Committee on Education Tuesday. She called it “a measure to eliminate the wasteful, ineffective and divisive DEI initiatives that have become interwoven in K-12 institutions.

Tichenor was critical of investments by school districts and the Biden administration for financially supporting DEI programs in public schools and argued they did not close achievement gaps among students who are in minority groups or are economically disadvantaged. 
She also pointed to the state’s two largest school districts — Fayette and Jefferson counties — for not signing a form from the U.S. Department of Education to certify their compliance with the Trump administration’s interpretations of civil rights law earlier this year.
“DEI reinforces division rather than unity, and encourages students, teachers and staff to see each other through the lens of identity and creating group think instead of creating independent thinkers,” Tichenor said. 
When committee members were able to question the proposal, a few Democrats voiced opposition. Rep. Sarah Stalker, D-Louisville, said that by ending DEI in education, the General Assembly would be “missing an incredible opportunity.” As a white woman, she’s had moments to reflect on her own privilege that many of her colleagues, friends, family and more do not have. 
“I think we’re missing an opportunity when kids have a moment to reflect about how the color of their skin does and does not allow them to move through the world,” Stalker said. “Running to them and trying to stifle that and trying to say, ‘You shouldn’t feel bad, so we don’t want to ever expose you to something that is going to make you have to pause and have maybe some internal feelings.’ It’s a missed opportunity for some really good dialog.”
Stalker added: “It’s not about making people feel bad about being white. I think it’s about acknowledging the historical privilege that white people have always had in this country.” 
Tichenor filed a similar bill during the 2025 legislative session, but it did not get a committee hearing. However, Republicans, who hold a supermajority in both the House and Senate, easily passed a law to end DEI in Kentucky’s public universities and colleges.
The senator was joined by Michael Frazier, the executive director of the Kentucky Student Rights Coalition, who backed the law to end DEI in higher education. He said that while DEI began with “good intentions” it has changed. 
The primary sponsor of the higher education law, Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, said the committee “already heard today the start of what will be countless hours — countless hours — of advocacy against this bill that will bear no relationship to the bill.” Decker’s proposal was hotly debated this year, with college students traveling to Frankfort to oppose the bill in committee meetings and Democrats in the House and Senate speaking against the bill during hour-long floor debates in both chambers. 
“There will be discussions of violations of inclusion, for example, that as if the bill stops all inclusionary methodology. You will hear things that are specifically excluded being spoken of as a problem with the bill,” Decker said. “The bill does one thing, as I understand it, and that is stop unconstitutional practices that cannot be defended in the United States of America that are based on exclusionary preferences that will stop such things as methodologies that we’ve heard about that have been harmful to one minority community.” 
Tichenor said that her bill, which will be called the Kentucky Education Equality Protection Act, will “not affect instruction on the historical oppression of a particular group of people.” She also said that it will not impact freedom of speech or association of students, mental and physical health services, single gender schools, bona fide occupational qualifications and accommodations based on sex, or the ability of a school district or public school to comply with a federal mandate, provided compliance is narrowly tailored to the express and enforceable provision.

Boeing reports the total transaction value at $8.3 billion, which includes acquiring Spirit’s net debt.
“This is a pivotal moment in Boeing’s history and future success as we begin to integrate Spirit AeroSystems’ commercial and aftermarket operations and establish Spirit Defense,” said Kelly Ortberg, president and CEO of the Boeing Co., in a news release.
The transaction moved forward after the Federal Trade Commission approved the merger with stipulations that Boeing divest itself of some key Spirit businesses, a move designed to ensure Boeing doesn’t have a monopoly.
In an FTC docket, the agency said the market for commercial aircraft is highly concentrated, with Boeing and Airbus SE accounting for 95% of large commercial aircraft delivered on an annual basis.
“The divestitures resolve FTC allegations that Boeing’s acquisition of Spirit would give Boeing the ability and incentive to raise the cost or degrade Airbus’ access to inputs for its competing aircraft,” an FTC news release said.
The acquisition includes all of Spirit’s Boeing-related commercial operations, which includes fuselages for the 737 program and major structures for the 767, 777 and 787 Dreamliner, the news release said.
Spirit Defense will continue as an independent supplier to the defense industry and will align to Boeing Defense, Space & Security for financial reporting and select enterprise functional and site support, but maintain independent governance and operations, Boeing announced.
Signs already were being replaced on Spirit AeroSystems buildings in Wichita, KWCH-TV reported.
“Boeing’s acquisition of Spirit AeroSystems will help build bridges between Seattle and Wichita and bring new opportunities to the Air Capital of the World,” said U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran in a news release.
U.S. Sen. Roger Marshall said the merger recognizes the “world-class talent” in Wichita.
“Our workers and the unions that represent them have kept America as the gold standard in aerospace, and they deserve to be at the center of any future investment,” he said in a news release. “I’m grateful that this agreement further solidifies Wichita’s prestige in the industry.”

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)A state government panel set up to evaluate judges’ pay recommends the Louisiana Legislature raise state judicial salaries — again. 

Louisiana’s Judicial Compensation Commission voted Monday to back a plan that would raise pay next year for district court judges by $25,414, appellate judges by $29,111 and state Supreme Court justices by $27,409. It also suggested smaller raises in 2027, 2028 and 2029, — ranging from $3,800 to $6,000 annually. 
The three judges who sit on the state Board of Tax Appeal, which meets between five and six days per month, would also see a pay hike of $35,800 in 2026 and subsequent salary increases of a little over $1,000 each year the next three years, under the commission’s recommendations. 
The panel followed a salary schedule created by economist Loren Scott, a retired LSU professor who state judges have paid to evaluate whether their compensation is adequate. Scott told the commission the salary increases, while hefty, would keep pace with inflation and other rising expenses. 

Louisiana trial court judges earn between $176,188 and $195,627, depending on whether they served at the district, appellate or Supreme Court level. Scott said the raises, which would run from 14% to 15.9% in the next year alone, would move the judges closer to the purchasing power they had in 1983. 
State judges have seen some form of an annual pay increase going back to at least 2019, when the first of five straight years of 2.5% hikes took effect. Even when legislators rejected permanent pay raises for judges over the past two years, they found a workaround to provide the judges with essentially the same increase, albeit on a temporary basis, through pay stipends. 
The commission’s newly adopted pay scales for the judges are only suggestions. Gov. Jeff Landry and Louisiana lawmakers ultimately have to weigh the higher salaries against other state expenses and decide whether to approve them. 

Yet legislators rarely turn down the judiciary request for pay raises. A critical mass of lawmakers from both political parties in the Louisiana Legislature are attorneys who have to appear in those judges’ courtrooms for their day jobs. 
The dynamic makes it awkward for lawmakers to reject judges’ requests for additional compensation.The legislature created the Judicial Compensation Commission, in part, to create a buffer between themselves and the judges to evaluate more independently what their pay should be. 

The 15 commission members include legislators, judges, attorneys and at least five members of the general public who must not be attorneys or elected officials. 

Some of those general public members have close ties to judges, however. For example, House Speaker Phillip DeVillier, R-Eunice, appointed Rebekah Cole, who is married to Supreme Court Justice Cade Cole, to one of the seats. 
The question of what is appropriate judicial compensation has become a touchier issue in recent years. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Weimer has made it a personal mission to rein in spending on judges’ salaries and other personal perks, such as state per diem payments they receive for travel and meals.
“The pennies become dollars and the dollars become millions over a period of time,” Weimer told the commission Monday. 
A study by the National Center for State Courts concluded Louisiana’s district court judges had the 17th highest compensation in 2023 compared to their peers in other states. Salaries for most other positions in Louisiana often fall well below the national average. 

But Scott and individual members of the judiciary have pushed back on the study’s conclusions. They said it doesn’t account for the financial perks judges receive in other states or the high rate at which judges are asked to pay into their retirement accounts.

“We are tens of thousands of dollars behind,” Supreme Court Associate Justice John Michael Guidry said in testimony before the commission. 

Guidry and several other judges vehemently disagree with Weimer that judicial compensation needs to be curbed, so much so that the chief justice regularly gets outvoted by his colleagues when it comes to budgetary matters. 
This year, Weimer tried a different tactic to get his message across to the compensation commission. He hired his own economist to counter Scott’s arguments and analysis, but the person didn’t come to the hearing to testify with Weimer. The chief justice withheld the economist’s name, saying he feared they might face retaliation from judges. 

Judicial compensation increases also affect far more than judges. A number of elected officials across the state, such as sheriffs and parish presidents, have their salaries tied to judiciary compensation in state law. When judges get a raise, many other public servants automatically see an increase in compensation as well, said former state Sen. Edwin Murray, D-New Orleans, who leads the commission.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/IMG_3663-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 14:58:27.140625

(Photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury)Virginia House Speaker Don Scott on Tuesday set a Jan. 6 special election in House District 77, hours after Del. Mike Jones, D-Richmond, resigned his seat following his win in the Democratic firehouse primary for the open Senate District 15.
Jones’ resignation creates a fast-moving contest in a district that spans parts of Richmond and Chesterfield County — and one that Democrats are eager to hold after expanding their House majority to 63 seats last month. 
The Senate seat Jones is seeking was vacated by Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi. And although he still faces Republican John Thomas — also on Jan. 6 — the district is widely viewed as safe Democratic. That political reality likely contributed to Jones stepping down early, giving Democrats time to mount a full campaign in his former House district.
So far, at least two Democrats have announced they’re running for the party’s nomination in District 77. Former Richmond city council member Michelle Mosby and attorney Charlie Schmidt will likely face off in another firehouse primary ahead of the special election. As of Tuesday afternoon, no Republican has declared a bid in the district.
Mosby, who represented the city’s 9th District on council and has long been active in Southside politics, framed her run as an extension of decades of community work. She said she has spent “more than two decades” serving Richmond and the Southside “as a public servant, small-business owner, nonprofit leader, and former President of Richmond City Council.”
Her campaign is emphasizing economic mobility, public safety and reentry, housing stability and youth support — issues she said she has worked on directly. 
“District 77 deserves a delegate who can be an authentic bridge — someone who knows the challenges families face, who has worked side-by-side with them, and who can deliver meaningful results in housing, public safety, reentry, youth supports, and economic development,” Mosby said.
Schmidt, a self-described progressive Democrat, attorney and longtime community activist, cast his candidacy as the next step in a career centered on public-interest work. 
“Throughout my life and my legal career, I have worked to protect the vulnerable, seek justice, and ensure our government is accountable to the people,” he said, adding that he hopes to bring that background to the state legislature. “Now I want to take that experience to the General Assembly.”
District 77, created during the 2021 redistricting process, is a safely Democratic seat that has remained in party hands since its creation. Jones was first elected there in 2023 before quickly rising as a party favorite in the race to replace Hashmi. Last month, he won his reelection bid unopposed. 
The Jan. 6 date means both chambers will hold special elections on the same day and in the same area. 
For Jones, the timing offers a likely path to the upper chamber. For Democratic hopefuls in District 77, it opens a rare, fast-track opportunity to join the General Assembly at the start of the 2026 session.

(Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)A nonprofit providing legal aid to low-income South Dakotans will retain its federal funding, despite claims of ineffectiveness from a fellow legal aid organization.
The decision leaves South Dakota’s legal aid landscape unchanged, but will increase scrutiny over Dakota Plains Legal Services operations over the next year.
Dakota Plains serves the western half of South Dakota, as well as Native Americans on and off tribal lands across the state. East River Legal Services, which serves the eastern part of the state, had said earlier this year that it would compete for Dakota Plains’ federal grant funding because the organization was not effectively serving clients.

Lea Wroblewski, executive director for East River Legal Services, said in July that some organizations working with low-income, vulnerable communities in Dakota Plains’ jurisdiction were unfamiliar with the nonprofit. She added that East River had “not been able to successfully refer a single housing case” to Dakota Plains in her three years on the job.
Representatives with the nationwide Legal Services Corporation spoke to members of the state Commission on Equal Access to Our Courts during a Tuesday virtual meeting. Corporation officials said they will award Dakota Plains one year’s worth of funding rather than a standard three-year grant. Dakota Plains will receive nearly $2 million in total grant funding for its geographical area and its services to Native Americans.
The organization will adhere to special grant conditions to centralize its intake system and involve leadership in a nationwide search for a permanent executive director. Interim Executive Director William Sulik requested another compliance review from the national corporation to assess the organization’s effectiveness and train staff members.
“I know that this is a trust given to us,” Sulik told commission members, “and we intend to keep that trust with the people of South Dakota.”
The commission also voted to award funding that was withheld from Dakota Plains while the corporation’s assessment was pending. The commission awarded Dakota Plains $154,000, with the stipulation that the organization’s Justice Bus operations are prioritized.
The Justice Bus launched at the beginning of this year and is the state’s first mobile legal aid office, meant to increase accessibility to legal aid services across the state — especially in legal deserts.

,DC,2025-12-09 18:59:46+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"No due process guarantee in fast-track removal proceedings, Trump administration argues",Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/no-due-process-guarantee-fast-track-removal-proceedings-trump-administration-argues,,"WASHINGTON — The Trump administration Tuesday defended the merits of its fast-track deportation policy before a panel of judges in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, saying immigrants who have been in the country for less than two years without legal authorization are not guaranteed due process.The suit, brought by immigration rights advocacy groups, challenges the Department of Homeland Security’s expanded expedited removal rule’s application to immigrants in the interior of the United States who cannot prove they have remained in the country for more than two years. The expanded policy, which allows the removal of immigrants without an appearance before an immigration judge, is a pillar of the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign. Arguing on behalf of the Trump administration, Drew Ensign from the U.S. Department of Justice said that immigrants cannot rely on due process rights granted in the Constitution because those rights are reserved for U.S. citizens. Congress and Supreme Court precedents restrict immigrants’ rights to due process, he said.Additionally, Ensign argued that because Congress authorized the DHS secretary to use expedited removal, the courts have no jurisdiction on the matter. Anand Balakrishnan, legal counsel for Make the Road New York, the immigrant rights advocacy group that brought the challenge, said the policy skirts a fair legal process for immigrants.Democratic state attorneys general also submitted a brief in support of the immigrant rights groups, arguing that the expanded use of expedited removal is unconstitutional. Those states include California, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai’i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Vermont and Washington state. Policy expanded to interiorFor decades, expedited removal has been used to apply to migrants apprehended at the U.S. border and quickly deported without appearing before an immigration judge. In January, the Trump administration expanded its scope to the interior of the country and applied it to any immigrant apprehended who cannot prove they have remained in the country for more than two years. An appeals court in late November declined the Trump administration's request to pause a district court's block of the policy while the appeal was pending. Tuesday's hearing was part of the Trump administration’s appeal on the merits of its policy before a different appeals panel, Judges Justin R. Walker, Neomi Rao and Robert L. Wilkins. President Donald Trump nominated Walker and Rao and former President Barack Obama nominated Wilkins.The panel appeared skeptical of the administration's argument that due process rights do not apply to immigrants who entered the U.S. without legal authorization.Duty to notifyThe judges seemed split, though, about if the government should be expected to explain the expedited removal statute to a person it is attempting to remove and what that person’s rights are to challenge their removal, or if the person should have to ask for their own due process rights. “Even if we accept your portrayal of how the due process works, … under that framing, there still has to be adequate notice (of removal),” Wilkins said to Ensign. Ensign argued that immigrants subject to expedited removal have sufficient notice they are being removed and can’t rely on the due process clause of the Constitution’s Fifth Amendment to challenge it. The executive branch has the authority to decide how to apply the clause to immigrants, he said.Wilkins pushed back on that argument, saying notices must meet minimum standards. “The notice (of removal) has to be sufficient,” he said to Ensign. “(It) has to inform you of at least what the procedures are or what you're facing.”Balakrishnan said a mere notice of removal is “inadequate.” An immigrant subject to expedited removal can be deported within hours and without having time to challenge their removal or even speak to an attorney, he said.Walker seemed skeptical that the burden of notifying an immigrant that they were subject to the policy fell to the government. “For someone who has chosen to be here illegally, in violation of our laws….from a due process perspective it’s not too much to ask that if someone here illegally wants the special non-expedited removal procedures that Congress has graciously afforded them, it's not too much to ask that they ask for them,” he said. Balakrishnan argued that wouldn’t be sufficient due process.“I think it's common sense that having even that bare amount of information, ‘if you've been here for over two years you're not subject to expedited removal’ would certainly decrease the risk of error,” Balakrishnan said. “I'm not sure how it would be overly burdensome for the government to do that.”",,,,2025-12-09 14:58:27.140625

Local communities around the country are seeking more input on where and how data centers are built. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)How unpopular are new data centers being designed to help train and run artificial intelligence models around the United States?
On Monday, six Florida organizations signed a letter sent to Congress by more than 200 other groups calling for a national moratorium on approval and construction of such facilities.
A typical A.I.-focused data center consumes as much electricity as 100,000 households, but the larger ones under construction will consume 20 times as much, according to the International Energy Agency.
“To say that data centers are unpopular right now is probably an understatement, to say the least,” admitted Dan Diorio, vice president for state policy for the Data Center Coalition, speaking beforethe Florida House Economic Infrastructure Committee Tuesday.
The industry has been “very responsive” to that public perception, Diorio said, and it’s important to inform local communities where such facilities might be located that data centers provide “significant job opportunities,” specifically in the skilled trades such as electricians, plumbers, and HVAC technicians.
“It’s about education and it’s about communication and upfront, honest conversations,” added Tiffany Cohen, VP with Florida Power & Light (FPL). “People want to be heard. The have valid concerns, and we need to address them.”
FPL is the state’s largest investor-owned utility, servicing more than 6 million individual accounts comprising around 12 million Floridians. The company has said it welcomes data centers to its service areas and supports their development.
Under questioning from Rep. Linda Chaney, R-Pinellas County, Cohen told lawmakers that the Florida Public Service Commission recently approved two new tariffs that will require that “large load” customers that create data centers in Florida to pay in advance for their expected energy costs, and not FPL’s ratepayers.
“Instead of our general body paying for that, customers have to pay for that upfront,” Cohen told the committee.
“In return, as their load materializes on our system, we will give them a refund of that money. It’s a state law, we can’t change the law, but we will refund the money to them as their load materializes. So, it ensures that they show up and that the amount of power that they say they’re going to take from us, they actually do, but it also forces them to pay those costs upfront. Which has never been done before.”
Data centers use large amounts of water, primarily for cooling servers. But Diorio said new closed-loop cooling systems enable use of both recycled wastewater and fresh water, allowing water supplies to be used multiple times.
Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis last week announced his proposal to protect Floridians from footing the bill for A.I. data centers and to empower local governments to reject their development in their communities. He wants to prohibit utilities from charging Florida residents to support hyperscale data center development, including electric, gas, and water utilities.
Tuesday’s committee hearing was the first of 14 the Florida House has scheduled through Thursday to discuss AI use in different facets of the Sunshine State’s industries.
The letter sent to Congress this week calling for a national moratorium on data centers was organized by Food & Water Watch.
“Floridians are facing some of the highest electricity bills in the country. The explosion of data centers driven by Big Tech’s greed represents an unprecedented threat to communities suffocating under a crushing affordability and climate crisis,” said Brooke Ward, senior Florida organizer for that organization, in a written statement.
“The only acceptable action to protect people and the environment is to halt the expansion of this unnecessary, dangerous, and under-researched industry in order to determine the true depth of harm. Floridians simply cannot afford a reckless ask-for-forgiveness-and-correct-later approach.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/data-centers-VA.jpg,,,2025-12-09 13:57:13.907869

(Photo: Cassandra Stephenson)The U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Monday that $12 billion will be available for one-time “bridge” payments to farmers who experienced trade market disruptions and increased production costs during the 2025 crop year.
The relief comes as Tennessee farmers are projected to lose $450 million this year, Gov. Bill Lee said during the Tennessee Farm Bureau’s annual meeting in Franklin on Tuesday.
Up to $11 billion in federal funding will be used for the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, which will provide relief payments to farmers who produce specific row crops, including soybeans, corn, cotton, and other crops widely grown in Tennessee. 
The remaining $1 billion will be reserved for specialty crops, sugar, and other commodities not covered in the Farmer Bridge Assistance program, but the distribution timeline for that funding is “still under development” and will “require additional understanding of market impacts and economic needs,” according to the USDA.
Payments will be based on planted acres.
TN Soybean farmers face ‘desperate situation’ amid inflation, weather extremes and tariffs

Farmers have until Dec. 19 at 5 p.m. to ensure their 2025 acreage reporting is accurate, and the USDA will announce the payment rate by crop the week of Dec. 22, according to Alison Slagell, senior policy advisor to the USDA secretary.
Producers must certify that their adjusted gross income is less than $900,000 to be eligible. The program will limit payments to up to $155,000 per person or legal entity, according to USDA Undersecretary Richard Fordyce. Producers are not required to hold crop insurance policies to receive payments.
Eligible farmers should expect to receive payments by Feb. 28.
“If you plant an eligible crop and you’ve taken a hit, you’ll receive support,” Fordyce said during a Monday news conference.
Covered crops include:

Barley
Chickpeas
Corn
Cotton
Lentils
Oats
Peanuts
Peas
Rice
Sorghum
Soybeans
Wheat
Canola
Crambe
Flax
Mustard
Rapeseed
Safflower

Lee said he is grateful for federal relief for farmers from the Trump administration.
“Our office has interacted with farmers in this state in order to advocate with the federal government for relief,” he said. “It’s a hard time, and you need to know that your elected officials understand that and are doing their best to navigate that in a way that’s gonna continue to help our industry.”
The payments are meant to “help address market disruptions, elevated input costs, persistent inflation, and market losses from foreign competitors engaging in unfair trade practices that impede exports,” according to the USDA. 
Fordyce described the program as an “economic loss” program spanning several factors that affected producers in the past year. When asked what portion of the payments are geared toward losses due to tariffs or trade deals, Fordyce said he is not sure about what portion of the payments were geared toward any one factor.










It’s hard to speculate the impact of a tariff policy. I do know that the plan for the impact of this tariff policy is actually to benefit producers, and this $12 billion relief package would be of great benefit to producers.


– Gov. Bill Lee


This year, Tennessee farmers growing soybeans, the state’s most prominent row crop, faced inflation, weather extremes and an unstable market amid tariff negotiations. In August, the University of Tennessee Institute of Agriculture projected that Tennessee soybean farmers would lose an estimated $110 million this year.
China — the United States’ largest soybean export partner — boycotted U.S. soybean purchases for several weeks in 2025 during negotiations with President Donald Trump, instead turning toward Brazil and Argentina for soybean imports.
China and Trump reached an agreement in October. China agreed to purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans before January, and at least 25 million metric tons each year from 2026 through 2028. 
From Oct. 30 through Dec. 8, China has purchased 2,845,000 metric tons of U.S. soybeans for the 2025-2026 marketing year, according to USDA data.
Asked whether Trump’s tariffs exacerbated farming losses in Tennessee, Lee said the tariffs generated money that will help offset the losses some producers suffered.
“It’s hard to speculate the impact of a tariff policy,” Lee said. “I do know that the plan for the impact of this tariff policy is actually to benefit producers, and this $12 billion relief package would be of great benefit to producers.”
“The tariff policy is complex and spans multiple industries,” Lee continued. “I can’t speculate as to the future there. But this plan is working, or is proposed to work. We’ll see how it works out.”
Fordyce and Luke Lindberg, the USDA undersecretary for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, blamed policies under the previous administration for the shaky farm economy. 
China has been investing more in soybeans from South America instead of U.S. soybeans since Trump’s first administration. China is also a key trade partner for other U.S. farm exports.
“I would not characterize our trade demand as only driven by China,” Lindberg said, adding that producers have not yet seen opportunities that were generated by Trump’s trade deals. “Certainly, they are an important buyer.”
Lindberg said the trade deal with China “specifies a floor” for soybean purchases, but Trump is “optimistic that the Chinese will buy more soybeans and other products than even indicated in the initial agreement.”
Regarding adherence to trade promises, Lindberg said Trump “has ways to create … historic leverage in trade negotiations.”
“I think folks that renege on their promises to American family farms run the risk of the president taking even more aggressive actions yet,” he said.

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel joined a letter with 20 other state attorneys general to U.S. congressional leadership from both parties, urging them to reject a proposal that would tie extended tax credits for the Affordable Care Act to a ban on coverage of abortion, calling it an “effort to implement a back-door federal abortion ban.”
Tax credit extensions for the Affordable Care Act were a key sticking point for Democrats that led to a record-long federal government shutdown this fall, which ended after parties agreed to renegotiate the tax credit. The letter characterized the move as “a brazen attempt to stymie extension of the tax credits by threatening access to critical healthcare in an already hostile environment.”
The attorneys general also emphasized the importance of states’ sovereignty in determining coverage under each state’s health care marketplace, which has long been a part of the Affordable Care Act’s structure.
“This attempt to use essential abortion care as a bargaining chip to extend ACA tax credits shows a blatant disregard for the health and rights of millions of Americans,” Nessel said in a press release from her office. “We’ve already seen the devastating consequences of gutting access to reproductive health care, and further restricting care would only make things worse. Congress must reject this latest concerted effort to interfere with personal medical decisions.” 
The letter also emphasized that federal dollars, under the initial passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2009 and 2010, are not used to fund abortion services except in very limited cases. 
The proposal comes just a week after a federal judge granted an injunction in a lawsuit filed by Nessel and leaders from other states that sought to block a provision of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” that would defund Planned Parenthood.

What this means, though, is unclear.
Board members during a Tuesday morning meeting expressed differing opinions on open enrollment,  a policy that broadly speaking would allow students to enroll in neighboring school districts. After debating the issue, the board initially seemed poised to remove it from its priorities for the upcoming legislative session but ultimately agreed to wave it through and make edits at a later date.
Board President Mary Schrag said the intention is to give the board and the Department of Elementary and Secondary Education a “seat at the table” as lawmakers consider provisions that alter how open enrollment would be administered.
“We don’t have to take a stance on (open enrollment),” she said. “I do think we need to make sure that we stay as a player and are at the table.”
State lawmakers have filed open enrollment bills for the past five years, passing out of the House each time but coming to a standstill in the Senate. The proposal has evolved over the years, with changes like a cap on the number of students that may leave a district and who is responsible for the cost of transportation.
Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger said if lawmakers move forward with open enrollment, she’d like the board to have a say in some of the details.
“(State lawmakers) continue to have conversations in the legislature about what is the best fit for Missouri and how do you create this opportunity for choice within the public system,” she said. “So, by having this board have an opinion that open enrollment is something we want to have a conversation about, it makes us relevant.”
She told state senators in a hearing about an unrelated issue last week that she “did not have a problem with” open enrollment as a concept.
“As a superintendent of schools, I can tell you that if a parent didn’t feel like that I met their needs, I want them to be able to go someplace,” she told the Senate Education Committee last Thursday.
Board member Pamela Westbrooks-Hodge, of Pasadena Hills, said Tuesday that she had concerns that she would like to enumerate in a clearer policy position.
“I want to be supportive of our board, but I am concerned about harming small communities, and that isn’t reflected in this language,” she said.
Board member Mike Matousek, of Kansas City, indicated that he supported the idea of open enrollment but he felt like approving the legislative priorities was premature.
“There are key issues that we just need to talk about first to understand what it is we’re actually supporting here, and what are our priorities,” he said.
He was the lone vote in opposition to approving the document.
Schrag said many of the priorities, like a focus on early childhood literacy, have come up in numerous board conversations.
“As board members, we are learning and absorbing and digging in all the time through all of our conversations,” she said. “It doesn’t require a specific agenda item, in some cases, to come to an understanding of a position.”
The board has approved legislative priorities for four years, focusing on improving the programs offered by the state’s education department.
Other priorities approved Tuesday include a recommendation to fully fund the formula that determines state aid for public schools and the creation of a program to improve math instruction statewide.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/090925_schrageslinger1-1024x614.jpg,,,2025-12-09 13:57:13.907869

(Getty Images)Lawmakers should reimplement the Presidential Fitness Test for students as a part of West Virginia’s application for funding through the federal Rural Health Transformation Program, legislators were told Tuesday.
Curtis Capehart, director of policy for Gov. Patrick Morrisey, gave an update on the program to the Legislative Oversight Commission on Health and Human Resources Accountability. 
The state submitted its application to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid for the program in November. West Virginia is eligible for more that $100 million per year over five years from the program, which aims to “transform the existing rural health care infrastructure and build sustainable health care systems that expand access, enhance quality of care, and improve outcomes for patients,” according to CMS. 
The federal government has said it would announce award funding for the program by Dec. 31. 
During the meeting, LOCHHRA chairman Del. Evan Worrell, R-Cabell, asked Capehart what priorities lawmakers should focus on during the 2026 legislative session for the application. 
“The one that immediately springs to mind is the Presidential Fitness Test,” Capehart said. “We would be asking to have that put into code so that that would come back.’
He added that there are no commitments relating to scope of practice and certificate of need in the state’s application. 
President Donald Trump issued an executive order July 31 reestablishing the Presidential  Fitness Test and the President’s Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. 
“As the United States prepares to celebrate its semiquincentennial anniversary in 2026, we must address the threat to the vitality and longevity of our country that is posed by America’s declining health and physical fitness,” the order says. “For far too long, the physical and mental health of the American people has been neglected. Rates of obesity, chronic disease, inactivity and poor nutrition are at crisis levels, particularly among our children. These trends weaken our economy, military readiness, academic performance and national morale.”
The school physical fitness exam was first established by President Dwight D. Eisenhower and was phased out during President Barack Obama’s administration. The components of the physical fitness test have changed over the years and include running, situps, pushups and stretching. 
Critics of the test say it caused embarrassment and shame for students.
Trump’s executive order does not say what metrics should be included on his version of the fitness test. 
The Rural Health Transformation program is a part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which Trump signed into law July 4. The bill makes historic cuts to Medicaid. Health care officials say the Rural Health Transformation Program will not make up for the approximately $1 billion per year that state hospitals are expected to lose once the legislation has been fully implemented.
The state has not yet released or published the application. Capehart said the application’s project narrative and supporting appendix documents would be made available online later this week.
According to a summary of the application, the state’s plan includes seven focus areas that include: building infrastructure to bring virtual and in-person care access to people on-demand; transporting residents to care when needed; recruiting, training and retaining health care workers in the state; supporting tech-enabled innovation and regulatory relief.
“West Virginia’s approach was deliberately structured for sustainability and will deliver on affordability and access,” Capehart told lawmakers Tuesday. “We’re confident that this plan will not end at the completion of the five-year grant cycle. It seeks to build a permanent infrastructure and programs that will strengthen health care in our state.”
The state will confront the health barriers that keep residents out of the workforce, he said. 
“Poor health is the single largest driver of low labor force participation and better health outcomes must be our primary focus moving forward,” Capehart said. “By moving toward investment in prevention as well, the state can restore more of our working-age population to health productivity, increasing fortunes of the entire state and all of our rural communities.”
Capehart said officials expect to hear how much funding the state will get on Dec. 31. Part of the funding is expected in the first few weeks of January 2026. Lawmakers would then appropriate the funding through legislation, Capehart said.

(Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)School districts — whether public or private — across the commonwealth may be required to draft a policy prohibiting student cellphones with limited exceptions following a unanimous vote in the state Senate Education Committee Tuesday. 
Sens. Devlin Robinson (R-Allegheny) and Steven Santarsiero (D-Bucks) introduced the bill to address the “growing issue” of cellphones in schools, where the devices can cause distractions and disrupt learning. 
“We know these devices are addictive. As adults, we know how difficult it is not to pick up our phones during meetings and other inopportune times. Imagine how difficult it is for children who are still developing self control,” said Robinson. 
Robinson, and others, shared concerns that students also missed out on social growth opportunities, such as face-to-face communication and teamwork. He pointed to studies linking screen time to emotional instability and disrupted brain development in teens.

Following an amendment, phones will be banned at the start of the 2027-28 school year, with exceptions for students with medical conditions or individualized education plans that require a communication device. 
Though committee members broadly supported the bipartisan proposal, several lawmakers pitched potential revisions. Sen. Dawn Keefer (R-York) wondered if some students might try to get an individualized education plan — which is often used for students with disabilities to get appropriate accommodations — in order to get phone access. 
“I wish the schools would take the initiative and do it themselves,” said Keefer, noting that some of her districts had different policies for middle grades versus high schools. “This is the problem with us doing one size fits all.” 
Sen. Lindsey Williams (D-Allegheny) said she had received “mixed feedback” on the proposal, and hoped a future version would better detail the process for public comment and include greater flexibility for exceptions.
“I just don’t believe that we have a crystal ball as legislators,” said Williams. 
The committee held a hearing on the topic this past October, while its House counterparts heard from parents and teachers last month.

The state and CAIR look to have a legal battle looming. (CAIR photo)Gov. Ron DeSantis said a lawsuit filed against him by a Muslim civil rights group he recently declared a terrorist organization is “very much welcome.”
Monday, DeSantis declared via executive order that the Muslim Brotherhood and the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) are foreign terrorist organizations. CAIR promised a lawsuit, alleging defamation and that the order is unconstitutional.
The governor during a news conference about water quality in North Miami Beach Tuesday said state Attorney General James Uthmeier “is ready, willing, and able to be fighting” the lawsuit.
DeSantis said the lawsuit will give the state discovery rights to the organization’s bank records and other information.
“They have every right to sue and then we’re going to have a right to get the information we need to make sure,” DeSantis said.
Florida’s executive order calls on state agencies to deny material support or resources to the organizations.
“The Muslim Brotherhood’s Islamist ideology is irreconcilable with foundational American principles of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness reflected in the Declaration of Independence and the United States Constitution, especially including the right to religious freedom and the equal protection of the laws,” the executive order states.

CAIR is a Muslim civil rights group. Its website says CAIR’s mission “is to protect civil rights, enhance understanding of Islam, promote justice, and empower American Muslims.”
CAIR is not on the federal government’s list of terrorist organizations.
In 2010, Pew Research called the Muslim Brotherhood “without question the world’s most influential modern islamist organization.”
“I think our executive order is kind of the beginning. I think you’re going to see statutory codification of how we handle different terror designations,” DeSantis said. On his social media, the governor posted that he hopes lawmakers proposing “to stop the creep of sharia law” “codify these protections for Floridians against CAIR and the Muslim Brotherhood.”
Last month, President Donald Trump signed an executive order declaring that “certain chapters or other subdivisions of the Muslim Brotherhood shall be considered for designation as Foreign Terrorist organizations.”
CAIR Florida interim Director Hiba Rahim released this statement following DeSantis’ executive order:
“An attack on our civil rights organization is a direct attack on our constitutional First Amendment rights and an attack on the civil rights of Florida’s Muslim community.
“Governor DeSantis’ executive order singles out and defames our community based on an ‘Israel First’ a political agenda. CAIR-Florida will not stand idly by while we are defamed and our rights re denied. We are taking legal action to ensure that all citizens, regardless of their background or political views, are protected equally under the law. We are upholding our commitment: See you in court.”

A sign in the mountain region heralds the coming hospital, but the site behind it is just a field of dirt. (Andrew Jones/KFF Health News)Madison County, tucked in the mountains of western North Carolina, has no hospital and just three ambulances serving its roughly 22,000 people.
The ambulances frequently travel back and forth to Mission Hospital in Asheville, the largest and most central hospital in the region. Trips can take more than two hours, according to Mark Snelson, director of Madison Medics EMS, the local emergency medical service.
“When we get busy and all three of them are gone, we have no ambulances in our county,” he said.
Snelson and others in Madison County aren’t seeking more ambulances. They want a hospital closer than Mission. And the state agrees. In 2022, North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services officials said Madison and three other mountain counties needed 67 more acute care hospital beds. The state raised that to 93 beds in 2024, then to 222 by Oct. 15.
But the only indication of a new hospital thus far is a 25-acre field of graded dirt with a sign planted beside the highway reading “FUTURE HOME OF AdventHealth Weaverville.”
For the past three years, Mission Hospital’s owner has contested Florida-headquartered AdventHealth’s attempt to build the hospital on land bought for $7.5 million in rural Weaverville, just minutes south of Madison County. It was supposed to open this year, an event that would have defied the national trend of rural hospital closures.
The irony is that the very law that calls for the new hospital — the state’s certificate of need, or CON, law — has been used to prevent further construction. Such laws are intended to cap unfettered health care expansion by allowing new hospitals and expansions only when a state can document a need for them. But the legal process has tied up the proposed Weaverville hospital in court, just as other such laws have done with projects in Tigard, Oregon; Connecticut; and Fort Mill, South Carolina.
All states had certificate of need laws until 1987, when the federal government repealed a mandate requiring them. Today, North Carolina is one of 35 states with the laws still on the books. Twelve others have repealed them or let them expire, and some, such as Montana and South Carolina, have significantly weakened theirs amid concerns they limit health care access and boost costs. President Donald Trump’s Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice are among those questioning the need for the laws.

In North Carolina, too, opposition to the state’s certificate of need law has surfaced in both the General Assembly, where a bill to repeal the law has been dormant since April, and more prominently in the state Superior Court.
But some hospital industry organizations, health care economists, and certificate of need lawyers argue that, though the laws create bureaucracy that can delay projects, that’s not justification to do away with them.
The principle behind certificates of need is to hold at bay what supporters say is unnecessary expansion and price inflation brought on by a free market, which makes health care more expensive for everyone.
“If the principle is worth preserving, don’t abandon the principle,” said Mark J. Silberman, a health care attorney with the Benesch law firm and former counsel for Illinois’ certificate of need board. “Improve the process to allow the principle to flourish.”
Who Should Fill the Need?
Mission Health is the largest health care network and the largest employer in the Tar Heel State’s share of the Appalachians. Nashville-based HCA Healthcare bought the century-old, nonprofit, six-hospital system for $1.5 billion in 2019, converting it to a for-profit operation that serves an 18-county region. (The Dogwood Health Trust, a nonprofit established as part of HCA’s purchase of Mission Health, helps fund KFF Health News’ coverage.)
Though AdventHealth already owns one hospital in the North Carolina mountains about a 30-minute drive from the Weaverville site, its bid to build a new one represents a threat to HCA’s stronghold. Mission argues it is best positioned to meet the needs the state says exist in the Madison County region.
“Not all acute care beds are the same,” Mission Health spokesperson Nancy Lindell said. “Instead of adding more beds at facilities that are unable to provide the complex medical and surgical care needed, the region would be better served by expanding bed capacity at Mission Hospital.”
An eastern North Carolina eye surgeon’s lawsuit filed in 2020 against the state’s health agency and top state officials alleged the state’s certificate of need law “has nothing to do with protecting the health or safety of real patients.” The ophthalmologist, Jay Singleton, has argued the law prevented him from performing surgeries at his own center because the state didn’t see a need to duplicate services already provided at the local hospital, where he was obligated to operate.
In early November, Republican state Treasurer Brad Briner, the State Employees Association of North Carolina, and several academics who study such laws nationally filed amicus briefs supporting Singleton’s case and urging a judge to reject the state’s attempt to dismiss it.
“I’ve characterized CON law as a permission slip to compete,” said Thomas Stratmann, a George Mason University economics and law professor who co-authored the brief. “It’s as if, when a McDonald’s wanted to open up a shop next to Burger King, they have to go to the state regulator to ask if that’s OK.”
Stratmann argued that, instead of raising prices, more competition would give hospitals and providers greater leverage in negotiating with insurance companies.
That view aligns with a stance the federal government has held for almost 40 years. With varying degrees of fervor under Democratic and Republican leadership, the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have argued that the laws are anticompetitive and bad for consumers. The Justice Department did not respond to questions about its current position, and the FTC declined to comment on the record.
“CON laws create barriers to entry and expansion, limit consumer choice, and stifle innovation,” the Federal Trade Commission wrote in an April letter to Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee, a Democrat, as the state’s legislature considered, but ultimately abandoned, amendments to its certificate of need law. “For these reasons, the Agencies have consistently suggested that states repeal or retrench their CON laws.”
‘It’s Personal’
In a June letter to Trump and congressional leaders, Senate Democrats named five North Carolina hospitals on a list of rural hospitals in danger of closing if the president’s then-pending spending and tax-cut legislation, called the One Big Beautiful Bill, became law, citing research from the University of North Carolina Sheps Center.
Two of the five North Carolina hospitals on that list, Angel Medical Center and Blue Ridge Regional Hospital, are part of the Mission Health system. Both had three consecutive years of negative profit margins, like hundreds of others on the list. Lindell, the Mission Health spokesperson, said HCA is committed to keeping those two facilities open.
Even so, Madison County Health Department Director Tammy Cody said the needs in the region remain and the certificate of need appeals process has slowed down getting help.
“This isn’t theoretical — it’s personal,” she said. “Every delay means a mother in labor risks a longer ride, an elder with chest pain waits longer for help, or a worker injured on the job faces unnecessary complications.”
AdventHealth spokesperson Victoria Dunkle said the hospital system supports the state’s law partly because it “protects rural access to health care and ensures the community has a voice in the process.” The legal process has kept families waiting, she said, but AdventHealth plans to move forward with the Weaverville hospital “as soon as possible.”
Snelson, the ambulance service director, voiced a question many in the region have asked since the hope of a new rural hospital surfaced.
“Why is it a bad thing for another hospital to come in here to take some of the stress off of Mission?” he asked. “Within a day of it opening, it’s going to be full.”

The law compels the U.S. Department of Justice to release nearly all investigative files in the government’s case against Epstein, who died in jail in 2019 awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges.The U.S. Department of Justice asked the court to release the records after Congress overwhelmingly passed the legislation last month requiring disclosure of “all unclassified records, documents, communications, and investigative materials in its possession that relate to Epstein or (co-conspirator Ghislaine) Maxwell.”Attorney General Pam Bondi must release the material by Dec. 19 in accordance with the law, which lawmakers dubbed the Epstein Files Transparency Act. Law covers grand jury materialEngelmayer described the act’s language as “strikingly broad” and wrote Congress was “undeniably aware” that grand jury materials in Maxwell’s case were in possession of the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of New York.“Its decision not to exclude grand jury materials despite knowledge as to their existence, while expressly excluding other categories of materials (such as classified information), indicates that the Act covers grand jury materials,” Engelmayer wrote.The order comes days after a Florida federal judge reached a similar conclusion Friday and ordered the unsealing of federal grand jury materials related to the government’s investigation of Epstein from 2005 to 2007.Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge for soliciting a minor for prostitution but avoided a federal probe when then-U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta cut a deal with state prosecutors. Acosta was later appointed secretary of Labor during Trump’s first administration.Florida interviewMaxwell is serving a 20-year prison sentence. The Trump administration recently transferred the sex offender to a minimum security prison shortly after Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche interviewed her in a Tallahassee, Florida, facility as pressure to release the Epstein files ramped up in Congress and among Trump’s base.According to transcripts, Maxwell told Blanche, Trump’s former personal defense attorney, that she “never witnessed the president in any inappropriate setting in any way. The president was never inappropriate with anybody. In the times that I was with him, he was a gentleman in all respects.”Trump had a well-documented friendship with Epstein but denies any involvement with Epstein’s alleged crimes. The president has said that he kicked Epstein out of his private Florida club, Mar-a-Lago, because Epstein had poached young female staffers from the club.Maxwell was convicted in December 2021, after a one-month jury trial, of conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts, conspiracy to transport minors to participate in illegal sex acts, transporting a minor to participate in illegal sex acts, sex trafficking conspiracy, and sex trafficking of a minor.The Justice Department maintains Epstein had over 1,000 victims.",,,,2025-12-09 13:57:13.907869

Due to advocacy work and successful legal challenges lodged against President Donald Trump’s administration, funding for several programs has been restored, allowing the Michigan College Access Network to relaunch the programs last month.

He noted the program’s support for the state’s goal to increase the number of working-age Michiganders with a skill certificate or college degree attainment to 60% by 2030. 
“With staff time being strained, a college adviser is crucial in meeting the needs of our students as they explore the transition to college,” Nelson said. “They provide focused, caring and relevant knowledge needed for students to be successful in education past high school.”

(Photo by John Moore/Getty Images)A federal judge struck down an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that indefinitely froze permits and leasing for wind energy projects, finding federal agencies had neither explained nor justified the regulatory about-face that followed the order.
Federal agencies’ decision to block leasing and permitting for wind projects was arbitrary and capricious because the agencies did not provide an explanation to justify reversing decades of past practice on wind energy permitting, the judge said.
“The Agency Defendants were required, at minimum, to ‘provide a reasoned explanation for the change’ and to ‘display awareness that [they were] changing position,’” Massachusetts District Court Judge Patti Saris ruled. “They failed to do so.”
Proposal for ratepayers to subsidize nuclear development gets cold reception

Saris’s order comes in response to a suit filed by New Jersey, 16 other states, the District of Columbia, and a New York clean energy group that collectively alleged federal authorities violated the Administrative Procedure Act, which governs how federal agencies can impose regulations.
State officials argued the feds failed to explain or justify reversing decades of regulatory policy around wind energy projects, a failure the plaintiffs said risked compounding recent rises in electricity costs.
“At a time when utility prices are skyrocketing, Trump’s job-killing freeze would only increase costs,” Attorney General Matt Platkin said in a social media post. “Proud to fight — and win — for NJ families in court.”
Spokespeople for Gov. Phil Murphy, who made wind a cornerstone of his energy policy, did not immediately return an email seeking comment.
The judge found a recent order from the U.S. Supreme Court that held agencies do not need a reasoned explanation to justify following executive orders stemming from authority explicitly and exclusively granted to the president by Congress does not apply in this case.
Unlike in that case, which turned on a challenge to a Trump executive order that ended a policy allowing transgender people to update gender markers on their passports, regulators in the wind matter were acting on their own authority at the president’s direction, Monday’s ruling says.
“Here, the Agency Defendants concede that no statute expressly requires them to follow rules prescribed by the President regarding wind energy authorizations,” the judge wrote.
Administration officials told the court that the review called for by Trump’s order was ongoing but could not provide any timeline for the probe, the judge said.
The freeze’s indefinite nature also violated the law, Saris said.
Portions of the Administrative Procedure Act require regulators to speedily process applications for permits and other licenses and rule on other matters before them within “a reasonable time.”
“While a President may direct a reappraisal of permitting practices after a change of administration … the Agency Defendants may not, as they have done here, decline to adjudicate applications altogether, for an unspecified time, pending the completion of a wide-ranging assessment with no anticipated end date,” the judge wrote.
The order itself presented no explanation for the freeze, Saris said. Instead, it cited vaguely defined potential issues with wind permitting and environmental reviews.
Trump’s order, issued on the day of his second inauguration, spelled doom for offshore wind projects that had already faced hurdles like rising costs, lengthy supply chain delays, and some local opposition from people who feared wind turbines’ effects on ocean views or marine mammals, though the latter has not been linked to wind projects.
Trump’s wind order froze permitting and leasing for all but one of New Jersey’s offshore wind projects.
In September, the administration intervened in a suit brought by state offshore wind opponents that sought to reverse approvals granted to Atlantic Shores South, a 2,800-megawatt offshore wind project that had secured permits and leases about a month before Trump took office.
The pause has affected that project too.
State energy regulators in August withdrew an order approving the construction of a 1,510-megawatt wind farm off the coast of Atlantic City in response to a request from Atlantic Shores. The company cited federal regulatory uncertainty among the barriers the project faced.
Like other wind projects, Atlantic Shores had faced rising costs and supply chain challenges stemming from the pandemic, but it had secured its permits and leases, completed surveying, and was approaching construction. It had been expected to begin delivering power by 2027.
“Those anticipated benefits are now jeopardized or deferred,” the judge wrote.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A debate on racism, sexism, and in-context quotations erupted Tuesday over a bill that would make Charlie Kirk only the second person — after Ronald Reagan — to be comemmorated in Florida statute.
Republican Sen. Jonathan Martin would memorialize Kirk’s birthday, Oct. 14, as “Charlie Kirk Day of Remembrance.” It comes three months after Kirk, a 31-year-old podcaster and right-wing debater, was assassinated while speaking at Utah Valley University.
It would slate him alongside Reagan as the only two people to have a special observance day in Florida law. Unlike holidays, observance days don’t allow for time off from school or work, and are generally just a day of recognition for a figure or event.
“I think that anybody who saw the video of Charlie Kirk getting — at his last speech, his last rally … ” Martin said before the Senate Governmental Oversight and Accountability Committee, appearing to get choked up as he took a lengthy pause and cleared his throat. “… Would agree that it’s important to remember somebody who lived a peaceful life.”
He continued, “I think that Ronald Reagan would be 100% OK with a Charlie Kirk Remembrance Day in the state of Florida.”
Following Kirk’s assassination on Sep. 10, Vice President J.D. Vance canceled his 9/11 memorial visit to fly out west. A week later, President Donald Trump and top Cabinet members spoke at his memorial service, held at the State Farm Stadium in Glendale, Arizona.
The political ramifications were massive. Teachers nationwide were suspended or fired for either applauding Kirk’s death or publicly claiming he was hateful. Some in the Trump administration, along with all of the Florida Cabinet, supported visa revocations for visa holders celebrating his death.
In Florida, pro-Kirk bills flooded in. Aside from Martin’s legislation, Rep. Kevin Steele — a candidate for chief financial officer — is sponsoring a measure to rename a road at every state university after Kirk. Sen. Ana Maria Rodriguez and Rep. Juan Porras have proposed a “Charlie Kirk Memorial Avenue” in Miami-Dade County. And Rep. Yvette Benarroch is carrying an identical form of Martin’s bill in the House.
‘Does not deserve the honor’
Although Martin emphasized that his bill was designed to signal to Floridians that political violence is wrong, Democrats raised serious concerns about some of Kirk’s comments — which Martin claimed were “spliced” and out-of-context.
They included quotes deriding Michelle Obama, Joy Reid, Sheila Jackson Lee, and Ketanji Brown Jackson as lacking “the brain processing power” to be taken seriously; claiming “prowling Blacks” target white Americans; questioning whether certain Black people received a job because of affirmative action; asking Taylor Swift to “submit” to Travis Kelce; and suggesting some gun deaths might be worth it to keep the Second Amendment “to protect our other God-given rights.”
“If you have to go through such mental and verbal gymnastics to explain away what this man said, how does he deserve a day of remembrance?” Sen. Tina Polsky asked.
“He was a provocateur. He was a podcaster. He did go on these college campuses, and it’s great that he was debating with people — that’s what we do all the time, that’s fine. But he’s still responsible for his own statements, no matter how you try to justify it,” she continued. “He does not deserve this honor.”
The bill passed along party lines, and will advance to the Education Postsecondary Committee.
“I went back and watched the debates,” Martin said. “If you look at the context, there’s not a single thing that he said that would disgust any reasonable American. … I don’t arrive at the same conclusion that those in the media that were trying to attack Charlie arrived at.”",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/charliekirk-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 12:58:03.202887

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A group pushing new congressional boundaries in the Hoosier state has created Fair Maps Indiana Action to engage in state legislative races. 
The independent, expenditure-only political action committee will boost members of the Indiana General Assembly who support new maps intended to maintain a Republican majority in the U.S. House. The entity will also target members who vote against redistricting by recruiting primary challengers and coordinating with other aligned groups.
A news release said the super PAC is planning to spend seven figures in key Indiana Senate and House districts in the 2026 primary elections.
It is an affiliate of Fair Maps Indiana, Inc., a project of the 501(c)(4) Defending America’s Comeback.


The Indiana House last week passed a new map that would give Republicans all nine congressional districts. The Senate moved it out of committee Monday, but it is unclear if there are enough votes to pass the full Senate chamber.
President Donald Trump has pushed GOP-led states to maximize their advantage by redistricting mid-cycle. Districts are usually drawn after the decennial census, which was last done in 2021. Trump and Vice President JD Vance, who visited Indiana twice to speak to Indiana Republicans, have specifically called out key Hoosier GOP leaders.
“The Indiana House came through and supported President Trump. The Senate needs to do the same,” the organization said in the news release. “For those that vote yes, we will be there to support their campaigns. For those that vote no, we will ensure that they will have a quality, well-funded opponent and those members are defeated in May.”
Indiana natives Marty Obst and Carlin Yoder will serve as chairman and treasurer of Fair Maps Indiana Action. Yoder served as Indiana chairman for the Trump-Vance 2024 campaign and is a former state senator.
Other team members include Chris LaCavita, Chip Englander, and John Brabender — all part of affiliate Fair Maps Indiana, Inc. That group has spent over $250,000 engaging with voters to promote Indiana redistricting, according to the news release. 
Super PACs make “independent” expenditures for communications expressly advocating the success or defeat of clearly identified candidates. But they can’t legally give directly to candidates or coordinate with a candidate campaign. Unlike traditional PACs, a super PAC may accept unlimited contributions from corporations and unions, and unlimited amounts from individual contributors so long as they are U.S. citizens or hold green cards.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC055820-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 12:58:03.202887

Richard Blumenthal joined nurses and labor leaders on Monday at the state Capitol in Hartford to assail a proposal by the Trump administration that could reduce the dollar amount nursing students and others can borrow for graduate degrees. 
“There are already enough roadblocks to becoming a nurse — financially, emotionally and academically,” Keisha Gartman, a registered nurse who started her nursing career 16 years ago as a certified nursing assistant, said during the press conference. “Yet instead of removing barriers, the government is adding new ones.”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, also referred to as H.R. 1, eliminates a program that allowed borrowers to take out federal student loans for graduate programs up to the full cost of tuition. Beginning in July 2026, there will be caps on federal borrowing for graduate degrees, with higher caps for “professional” degrees and lower caps for all others. 
The legislation charges the federal Department of Education with determining which types of degrees fall into each category.  A “consensus definition” released earlier this year by a panel convened by the Trump administration designated 11 programs, including law, medicine and dentistry as “professional.” 
Degrees in nursing — as well as physical therapy, public health and social work — were excluded, meaning they would be subject to the lower borrowing limit. 
Effective July 2026, students pursuing professional degrees can borrow up to $50,000 annually, or $200,000 total. Those pursuing graduate degrees not designated as “professional” will have a stricter limit: $20,500 annually, or $100,000 total. 
Gartman and several other nurses at the press conference said they would not have been able to get the education they have if the policy been in place when they were in school. 
Ellen Keast, press secretary for higher education at the U.S. Department of Education, said the policy is intended to curb the ballooning cost of graduate degrees.
“While still in development, the Trump Administration is implementing long-needed loan limits on graduate loans to drive down the cost of programs, and under the new limits,” stated Keast in emailed comments. “We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms.”
The department has yet to issue a proposed or final rule regarding which degrees qualify for the higher borrowing caps. Early next year, the Department will issue a notice of proposed rulemaking, which will initiate a 30-day public comment period. 
A graduate degree isn’t required for nursing. While roughly 17% of registered nurses hold a master’s degree or higher, the vast majority do not. And, according to a fact sheet about the new policy released by the Department of Education, “95% of nursing students borrow below the annual loan limit and therefore are not affected by the new caps.”
But the nurses at Monday’s press conference said certain roles in the industry — like becoming a nurse practitioner, as well as training, education or policy positions — require a master’s degree.  
Linda Wagner, executive director at the University of Bridgeport’s School of Nursing, said graduate-educated nurses play critical roles as providers and teachers.
“We see every day master’s-prepared nurses who serve as faculty, as well as advanced practice registered nurses who are the providers families know best,” Wagner said  in emailed comments. “When borrowing is restricted, it becomes harder for talented students to complete the training required for these essential nursing roles.”
Critics of the Trump proposal, including Blumenthal, say it restricts opportunities in the midst of a national nursing shortage. 
“Here is the definition of stupid: At a time when you have a shortage of nurses, put unrealistic, cruel, dumb caps on student loans for nurses,” Blumenthal said. “That’s what not to do. But that is exactly what the great, big, beautiful bill of Donald Trump is doing.”
Connecticut needs roughly 3,000 new registered nurses a year to make up for retirements — without factoring in nurses who leave the profession for other reasons, like burn out, according to a Governor’s Workforce Council Strategic Plan published in 2020. At the time, the state’s nursing programs were only producing 1,900 graduates a year. 
During comments on the House floor last week, Rep. Joe Courtney decried the policy, calling it “out of touch,” “offensive” and “an insult to the people who go through extensive training, testing, and certification before they are, again, allowed to practice their profession, the caring profession.”
In the fact sheet released by the Department of Education, the Trump administration rejected the critique that the proposal fails to recognize the important work that nurses do.
“The definition of a ‘professional degree’ is an internal definition used by the Department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits, not a value judgement about the importance of programs. It has no bearing on whether a program is professional in nature or not.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NURSING-PROFESSIONAL-DEGREE-1209-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 12:58:03.202887

The article is part of Mississippi Today Ideas’ ongoing effort to publish thoughtful guest essays.

I grew up in Greenville, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, where family and community are everything.
Access to care was often determined by distance and circumstance. I watched some of my neighbors, friends and family go without the health services they needed because they could not afford them or because those services were never close enough to reach.
I saw how that lack of access held people back from living fully and reaching their potential. Those early experiences are why this work is deeply personal to me.
Across the Deep South, reproductive and sexual health care remains under constant threat. What happens here often sets the tone for the rest of the country. In Mississippi, our communities have carried that weight for generations, working against systems that make something as basic as care feel out of reach.
Still, we continue to move forward, creating new possibilities for what access can look like because our people deserve more than what history has offered us.

Opening a reproductive health clinic inside the Jackson Medical Mall felt intentional. The mall, once a neglected shopping center in a Black neighborhood, was brought back to life through Dr. Aaron Shirley’s vision of turning a forgotten space into one that could serve people again. The Jackson Medical Mall is part of the continuing legacy of expanding health care access in Mississippi by Dr. Shirley, who died in 2014.
That transformation reminds us that health care belongs in the heart of the community. Our clinic continues that commitment by creating a place where people can receive high-quality care close to home.
When we put out the call to Jackson residents, they made it clear that access also means choice. They wanted the same trusted, patient-centered care available through telehealth, but in a place they could walk into and experience in person.
That honesty from the community shaped what came next. In our new clinic inside the Jackson Medical Mall, we have created a space built in direct response to what people told us they needed most, care that feels personal, close and consistent. 
Patients will find both free and low-cost services that include wellness exams, testing and treatment for STIs, contraceptive counseling, pregnancy testing and preconception care.
We also offer resources such as the over-the-counter contraception Opill, prenatal vitamins and a community wellness pantry that will rotate based on local needs. Patients can also receive one-on-one support with scheduling appointments, enrolling in insurance programs like Mississippi’s Medicaid Family Planning Waiver, and connecting to other reproductive wellness resources.
This work honors the people and communities that raised me and reflects a continued commitment to the belief that everyone deserves access to care that is respectful, compassionate and rooted in trust.
I have witnessed the beauty of the people in Jackson and the power of what community can build together.
The opening of GetPersonal by Converge represents more than a new clinic.
It is a reflection of what can happen when care is shaped by the people it is meant to serve and grounded in the belief that every Mississippian deserves the best of what health care can be.

Tom Perriello announced Tuesday that he will seek the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican U.S. Rep. John McGuire in 2026. (Photo courtesy of campaign) Former Congressman Tom Perriello is jumping back into Virginia politics, announcing Wednesday that he will seek the Democratic nomination in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District — setting up a serious challenge to U.S. Rep. John McGuire, the Republican incumbent, in a district long viewed as safely red.
Perriello rolled out his campaign in a video posted on X, arguing the district is facing a “crisis of leadership” and accusing McGuire of failing to stand up for constituents during a period of rising costs and political volatility. He framed his run as a fight for working families.
“People are angry and confused, and they have a right to be. Families can’t afford groceries because Republicans in Congress, like John McGuire, won’t stand up to (President Donald) Trump’s tariffs.”
He criticized “tax cuts for huge corporations” and said Washington politicians have ignored the district’s economic pressures, pointing to rural hospital closures, food prices and rising unemployment. 
Perriello added that when the federal government “turns our region’s largest employer, the University of Virginia, into a political punching bag, our congressman was nowhere to be seen.”
McGuire did not immediately respond to text messages seeking comment. 
But Rick Buchanan, the chairman of the district’s GOP committee, said in a phone interview Tuesday that due to the current political climate and the results of the November elections, “it’s going to be an uphill battle for John.”
Perriello, 51, represented the 5th District from 2009 to 2011 after narrowly defeating longtime Republican U.S. Rep. Virgil Goode by just 727 votes out of more than 317,000 cast. 
At the time, the district covered much of Southside Virginia and extended north to Charlottesville. Perriello lost his seat in 2010 to Republican state Sen. Robert Hurt.
Before and after his brief congressional tenure, Perriello carved out a career in diplomacy and advocacy. 
He led U.S. Programs at the Open Society Foundations for more than four years and held two senior U.S. State Department roles in the administration of then-President Barack Obama. 
From 2015 to 2016, he served as the U.S. Special Envoy for the Great Lakes Region of Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo. He ran for governor in 2017, losing the Democratic primary to Ralph Northam.
Most recently, Perriello served as U.S. Special Envoy for Sudan beginning in February 2024, overseeing diplomatic efforts aimed at halting civil conflict, supporting civilian leadership and responding to famine and mass displacement. He resigned Jan. 18, shortly before Trump’s second inauguration.
In announcing his return to electoral politics, Perriello leaned on his previous work in economic development and health-care reform. 
“When you elected me to Congress, I listened,” he said. “I fought to bring down the cost of health care, to expand rural internet access, and to bring good paying jobs into our region, including clean energy jobs.”
He also tied his campaign to a broader argument about political extremism and democratic stability. 
“I fought to protect civil rights, public education, and reproductive freedom, and I’ve stood up to corruption, hate, and authoritarianism at home and abroad,” he said, adding, “I will always defend our communities and our Constitution.”
The 5th District, which currently includes Charlottesville, Lynchburg, and a wide sweep of rural counties stretching to the Richmond suburbs and the North Carolina line, has been reliably Republican for more than a decade. Republicans have held a consistent advantage under the congressional map implemented by court-appointed special masters in 2021.
But the political landscape could shift with Virginia Democrats advancing a constitutional amendment that would allow the General Assembly — rather than the current bipartisan redistricting commission — to draw future congressional and legislative maps mid-decade. 
If passed again in 2026 and if approved by voters, the amendment would give lawmakers authority to craft boundaries more favorable to their party. Democrats have made no secret of their goals, intending to use a new map to strengthen their hold on competitive regions and potentially create a 10-1 Democratic-leaning congressional map if political conditions allow.
David Richards, a political science professor at the University of Lynchburg, said Perriello’s decision to run suggests Democrats see an opening. 
“I see Tom Perriello’s entry into this race as a sign that there is blood in the water,” Richards said, arguing that McGuire heads into 2026 in a more precarious position than many assume.
He pointed to several factors, including the district’s partisan makeup and shifting political winds. 
“The 5th District is the least Republican of the western House districts,” he said, noting that McGuire’s 2024 win was aided by Trump performing better in Virginia than he did four years earlier. Richards said that if Democrats experience “a large swing,” similar to the shift seen in Tennessee’s recent special elections, McGuire “might lose.”
He also noted that McGuire could face a primary challenge from former U.S. Rep. Bob Good, who has not ruled out attempting to reclaim his old seat. 
“If Good and McGuire duke it out, it could weaken the GOP enough that, coupled with a blue wave and Perriello being a known quantity in the district, it might give Democrats a win,” he said.
But Richards cautioned that the race remains fluid, with Democrats pushing the constitutional amendment that could reshape the political map, “which could upset any of these races,” he said. 
If Democrats succeed in creating what he called “some sort of ‘super district’ in Western Virginia,” he said Republican incumbents John McGuire, Ben Cline and Morgan Griffith could be forced into the same district. In that scenario, Perriello “sets himself up for one of the new, more Democratic leaning districts around Albemarle County or in Southside that might be created.”
“Either way,” Richards said, “Perriello is positioning himself to be a threat in 2026.”
For now, Perriello enters a race where Democrats remain underdogs. 
McGuire, a former Navy SEAL and state legislator from Goochland County, won the seat last cycle after defeating Good in a contentious Republican primary. The district supported Trump by wide margins in both 2016 and 2020, and GOP turnout remained strong in 2024.
But Perriello, who has kept ties in progressive organizing circles and foreign-policy networks, believes he can rekindle the coalition that propelled his 2008 upset. 
In his announcement, he framed his run as a grassroots effort focused on economic fairness and political accountability.
“Together, we’re going to fight for this district, we’re going to win back this seat, and we’re gonna bring the people’s voice back to Congress,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-09 16:21:12+00:00,CT Mirror,Federal judge throws out Trump order blocking wind energy development,Associated Press and John Moritz,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/09/judge-throw-out-trump-order-blocking-wind-projects/,Judge said the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was 'arbitrary and capricious' and violates US law.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A federal judge on Monday struck down President Donald Trump’s executive order blocking wind energy projects, saying the effort to halt virtually all leasing of wind farms on federal lands and waters was “arbitrary and capricious” and violates U.S. law.
Judge Patti Saris of the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts vacated Trump’s Jan. 20 executive order blocking wind energy projects and declared it unlawful.
Saris ruled in favor of a coalition of state attorneys general from 17 states and Washington, D.C., led by New York Attorney General Letitia James, that challenged Trump’s Day One order that paused leasing and permitting for wind energy projects.
Trump has been hostile to renewable energy, particularly offshore wind, and prioritizes fossil fuels to produce electricity.
The ruling comes on the heels of another court battle over the fate of Revolution Wind, the 704-megawatt offshore wind farm being launched from the State Pier in New London.
The Trump administration ordered a halt to construction on the project in August, at which point work was already 80% complete.
The project’s developers sued along with Connecticut Attorney General William Tong and his counterpart in Rhode Island. The developers’ lawsuit succeeded in lifting the stop work order, while Tong’s lawsuit remains pending.
In a statement Tuesday, in response to the court ruling on the president’s wind moratorium, Tong said, “Trump’s erratic attacks on wind energy and his bizarre rants about windmills never made any sense.”
The attorney general added, “[Trump] was going to jack up energy costs for American families and businesses, further our reliance on fossil fuels and foreign oil, and throw workers off good jobs. We sued, we won, and I’m going to keep fighting to protect Connecticut’s ability to secure our own energy future that makes sense for our costs and climate.”
New York Attorney General James said she was grateful the court stepped in “to block the administration’s reckless and unlawful crusade against clean energy.”
“As New Yorkers face rising energy costs, we need more energy sources, not fewer,” James said. “Wind energy is good for our environment, our economy, and our communities.”
White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said Monday night that offshore wind projects were given unfair, preferential treatment during the Biden administration while the rest of the energy industry was hindered by burdensome regulations.
“President Trump has ended Joe Biden’s war on American energy and unleashed America’s energy dominance to protect our economic and national security,” Rogers said in a statement to The Associated Press.
The coalition that opposed Trump’s order argued that Trump doesn’t have the authority to halt project permitting, and that doing so jeopardizes the states’ economies, energy mix, public health and climate goals.
The coalition includes Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Washington state and Washington, D.C. They say they’ve invested hundreds of millions of dollars collectively to develop wind energy and even more on upgrading transmission lines to bring wind energy to the electrical grid.
The government argued that the states’ claims amount to nothing more than a policy disagreement over preferences for wind versus fossil fuel energy development that is outside the federal court’s jurisdiction. Justice Department lawyer Michael Robertson said in court that the wind order paused permitting, but didn’t halt it, while Interior Secretary Doug Burgum reviews the environmental impact of wind projects.
The executive order said there were “alleged legal deficiencies underlying the federal government’s leasing and permitting” of wind projects under the Biden administration.
A previous judge in the case allowed it to proceed against Burgum, but dismissed an action against Trump and other Cabinet secretaries. Judge William Young allowed the states to proceed with claims that blocking permits for wind energy projects violates the Administrative Procedure Act, which outlines a detailed process for enacting regulations, but not the Constitution.
Wind is the United States’ largest source of renewable energy, providing about 10% of the electricity generated in the nation, according to the American Clean Power Association.
Marguerite Wells, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York, said wind energy is a key component of powering the nation’s electric grid.
Wind “is currently one of the most cost-effective ways to generate power and is being used successfully not only in the United States, but across the world,” she said. “With this ruling behind us, projects can now be judged on their merits. We thank the attorneys general who helped us get this case over the finish line.”
Kit Kennedy of the Natural Resources Defense Council called the decision a win for consumers, union workers, U.S. businesses, clean air and the climate.
“From the beginning of its time in office, the Trump administration put a halt to the wind energy projects that are needed to keep utility bills in check and the grid reliable,” Kennedy said.
The wind order “has been a devastating blow to workers, electricity customers, and the reliability of the power grid,” she said, adding that the Trump administration “should use this (ruling) as a wake-up call, stop its illegal actions and get out of the way of the expansion of renewable energy.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/AP25125499978507-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 11:58:20.327181

Dec. 12, 2024. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — The State of Nebraska has charged State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst with “disturbing the peace,” a slight downgrade in criminal allegation from the public indecency citation he received in October.
Court documents filed late Monday show the freshman senator now faces a Class III misdemeanor charge, with McKeon’s arraignment scheduled Wednesday in Lancaster County Court.

McKeon’s attorney Perry Pirsch said McKeon will likely plead no contest, which would allow him to accept any coming penalties without admitting guilt, and would waive his right to a trial.
The Nebraska State Patrol cited McKeon for misdemeanor public indecency in late October after investigating an allegation by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party this spring in Lincoln.
The Patrol received a report in early September that McKeon allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said at the time.
Public indecency is a Class II misdemeanor in Nebraska, and comes with a maximum sentence of six months behind bars, a $1000 fine, or both. Disturbing the peace comes with a maximum sentence of three months imprisoned, a $500 fine or both.
Lancaster County Attorney Pat Condon, who determined the charges, based the change on information from the Patrol investigation and Nebraska statutes, and said disturbing the peace was the most appropriate charge. He said he could not elaborate further on his reasoning.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Pirsch called the updated charge “a victory” that better aligns with McKeon’s perspective of the incident.
“This is consistent with his testimony (that) he only told a bad pun and patted her on the back,” Pirsch said in an email. “There was nothing sexually charged about it or even based on gender.”
However, McKeon still faces a possible civil lawsuit from the staffer in question.
Kathleen Neary, the attorney representing the woman making the allegations, said Tuesday that her client is “proceeding with the administrative filings as required by law” in regards to her civil action.
“As for the criminal charges against Senator McKeon, I defer to the county attorney,” Neary said in an email. “It will be interesting to see how Senator McKeon’s ever-evolving story will continue to change if he testifies under oath during his criminal trial.”
Nebraska lawmakers delay further action on colleague’s groping allegations

The Examiner is aware of the alleged victim’s name but is not publishing it because it is the policy of States Newsroom and the Examiner not to identify people who say they have been abused unless they wish to talk publicly.
The Nebraska Legislature is also in the midst of a separate internal investigation into the allegations against McKeon. The Executive Board, which is in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, met Monday to discuss the situation, but delayed voting until they had all voting members present. The Executive Board plans to meet on the matter again as early as Saturday.
State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who chairs the group, said the board already decided in October to move McKeon’s former first-floor office, exchanging it with another first-floor office previously occupied by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.
Since news broke about McKeon’s citation, state officials — including Gov. Jim Pillen — have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign. Pirsch said Monday that filing a no contest waiver would help McKeon “put the matter behind him and to focus on the upcoming legislative session.”

Shared on social media on Nov. 18, Slotkin appeared alongside Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona and Reps. Jason Crow of Colorado, Chris Deluzio of Pennsylvania, Maggie Goodlander of New Hampshire and Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania, who are all military veterans and former intelligence officers. The video quickly drew Trump’s ire, with the president calling the video “SEDITIOUS BEHAVIOR, punishable by DEATH!”
On Saturday, the Detroit News reported that the first-term senator had formed a legal defense fund, with Slotkin spokesperson Sonja Thrasher telling the News the fund had been created with approval from the bipartisan U.S. Senate Ethics Committee.
“Since President Trump called for Senator Slotkin to be arrested, tried, and hanged on November 20th, he has attempted to weaponize federal law enforcement and America’s legal system against her, reportedly over the objections of career FBI personnel,” Thrasher told the News.

(Photo by Glen Stubbe/Minnesota Reformer)Nearly half of Minnesota food shelf shoppers face barriers to accessing free food sites, including a lack of transportation, poor food selection and limits on how often they can visit, according to a survey released this month.
The survey, conducted by the The Foundation for Essential Needs and University of Minnesota Extension, is based on responses from nearly 10,000 Minnesotans surveyed at 308 food shelves earlier this year.
Almost half of the responding households have children and more than a third include seniors. Nearly one-third of food shelf shoppers surveyed said it was their first visit or they had just started using the food shelf in the past six months.
Asked what the most important experiences are when visiting a food shelf, 70% of shoppers listed feeling welcomed by staff or volunteers. The other most common responses were reasonable wait times, fresh and appealing food selections and a variety of foods available.
Food shelves, for the most part, seem to fulfill these wants — around 80% of respondents said they’re often able to choose their own food, and 94% said that they often feel welcomed by staff.


Other findings: 72% of respondents said they choose between food and other expenses like housing and medical costs; 52% said they have special dietary needs from chronic conditions; and 10% got all their food in the last 6 months from food shelves.
“Just like any of us, food shelf shoppers want fresh, nourishing food — and for the more than half who are juggling dietary restrictions, that need is even more urgent,” said Kate Burggraff, the executive director of FFEN, in a release.
Among foods that shoppers want at each visit, eggs and cooking basics like oil and spices were hardest to come by — only around 40% said they could always find eggs and cooking basics at the food shelf they were surveyed at.
The Food Group previously estimated that Minnesotans made nearly 9 million visits to food shelves in 2024, including 3.2 million visits by children.

(Wes Muller/LA Illuminator, Nov. 17, 2020)Former U.S. Rep. Cedric Richmond, D-New Orleans, said he turned down an offer to be the interim president of the Southern University System. 
Richmond said in an interview Monday at the State Capitol that while he was interested in the position, the timing wasn’t right because he is scheduled to undergo shoulder surgery next week. Richmond said he decided over the weekend he would not accept the position. 
The Southern University System Board of Supervisors was scheduled to name an interim president Nov. 28 but did not due to what board chairman Tony Clayton described as a computer error with the agenda. Clayton said an interim would be decided at the board’s Dec. 19 meeting. 
Clayton has not yet responded to a request for comment for this report. 
Current Southern President Dennis Shields, who has been in the position since 2022, said last month he will leave his position before his contract expires in 2029 because the board wanted to go in a different direction. A search committee to select Shields’ replacement will be formed early next year. 
Richmond resigned from his congressional seat in 2021 to become a senior adviser to President Joe Biden and later held a similar role with the Democratic National Committee. 
Richmond said he still remains committed to Southern. His mother, Maple Gaines, is on the university’s board of supervisors, and his family has a $600,000 endowment at Southern in the name of his mother and late father, Sidney Richmond Jr.. Cedric Richmond said he intends to increase that amount to $1 million to support scholarships for poor students from his parents’ hometowns. 
Richmond, who earned his bachelor’s degree from Morehouse College and a law degree at Tulane University, said he believed Southern should be among the elite historically Black colleges and universities and the best academic school in the Southwestern Athletic Conference. 
“I really think what Southern needs is a strong, independent president who can direct and lead the university, and also make sure that the roles between the board and the president are clear,” Richmond said.

(Louisiana State University)Research from an LSU professor and his students could make it cheaper and easier for small towns and rural communities to test for infectious diseases in their wastewater, potentially giving them the upper hand in public health efforts.
Aaron Bivins, a civil and environmental engineering assistant professor at LSU, used a 3-D printer to fashion what looks like a Wiffle Ball. It can be opened up, filled with a packet of activated charcoal pellets, screwed back together and then lowered on a string to sample wastewater.
The cost per ball: $4, which puts it within reach of municipalities that can’t afford the automatic samplers used in big-city sewerage systems. Those devices cost between $10,000 and $25,000 to buy and install, and they need a power source — not always easy to access in rural areas. 
“The resources in these communities are quite limited, so spending $20,000 on auto samplers is not really in the budget,” Bivins said. 
More than just an effort to see what pathogens exist, wastewater sampling can help scientists tell how diseases spread throughout human and animal populations. 
Bivins and his team spent three months using their devices to sample raw sewage coming into a small wastewater treatment plant for an undisclosed site in Louisiana. Their findings were recently published in the academic journal ScienceDirect.
The professor said the new technology could offer help fill the information void in areas where health care isn’t readily available or regularly used.
“When people get ill, they don’t always go to the doctor,” Bivins said. “From a public health perspective, this creates a lot of challenges in terms of knowing the true health status of a community.”
Historically, most wastewater sampling has focused on urban areas, leaving a gap in research for rural settings that public health resources often miss. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention runs a National Wastewater Surveillance System to monitor the spread of COVID-19, influenza and the common respiratory virus. The data gathered comes from roughly 140 million citizens, representing less than half of the U.S. population. 
“Who ends up being left out of that system are people living in … rural places who are served by small wastewater plants,” Bivins said. 
By making sampling tools more accessible, he said small municipalities and rural communities can gather more data, which means scientists would have more accurate information for their research. 
“The idea that we could deploy these very inexpensive samplers as a way of monitoring what types of antibiotic-resistant genes are present in our community is a really powerful one,” Bivins said.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Waterfilter-8-scaled-e1765296275395-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-12-09 11:58:20.327181

The count is one requirement for HUD Continuum of Care funding, which the agency in a recent notice threatened to drastically cut. (Patrick Lohmann/Source NM)Faced with increasing uncertainty over federal Housing and Urban Development’s homelessness-prevention funding, the leader of a state coalition said Monday she will ask the New Mexico Legislature to fill in a gap of roughly $12 million when lawmakers meet in January.
New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness Director Monet Silva told Source New Mexico on Monday her organization needs state funds because funding through HUD’s Continuum of Care—the agency’s main anti-homelessness program—is increasingly precarious. 
The coalition organizes Continuum of Care applications from statewide nonprofit organizations that provide prevention and assistance services to the state’s growing unhoused population through services such as street outreach, emergency shelter and transitional housing, as well as permanent supportive housing for unhoused people with disabilities. The funds are divided between nonprofits in Albuquerque and the rest of the state.
The coalition organizes Continuum of Care applications from statewide nonprofit organizations that provide prevention and assistance services to the state’s growing unhoused population through services such as street outreach, emergency shelter, transitional and permanent housing.
Rural, unhoused people statewide cite deposit, application fees as greatest barrier to housing

Since the 1990s, the HUD program has typically allocated $14 million annually to New Mexico nonprofits tackling homelessness, according to the coalition’s website. In the most recent funding round, the state received $17 million, Monet said.
But on Nov. 13, HUD issued a sudden “Notice of Funding Opportunity” to New Mexico and other states that suggested it was seeking to slash Continuum of Care funding by roughly 70%. That would leave New Mexico’s homelessness nonprofits with between $5 million and $6 million, Silva said, and the only about six weeks to complete the application instead of the typical six months.
The announcement prompted two lawsuits, one in November from a group of state attorneys general and a more recent one on Dec. 1 from national anti-homelessness organizations. And then, on Monday, the New Mexico coalition alerted potential nonprofit recipients that HUD had removed the notice from its website without explanation. The coalition pointed to the lawsuits as the likely reason the notice no longer appears on the HUD website. 
While HUD removing the notice provided Silva and her team a “little moment to breathe” Monday, she said the coalition still expects a drastic reduction in funding it and others rely on to provide vital services to the unhoused.
Amid funding cut threats and homeless camp sweeps, a volunteer loses hope but keeps counting

Silva said she is meeting with state officials next week, including Workforce Solutions Department Secretary Sarita Nair, to discuss the state filling in the HUD gap during the legislative session beginning Jan. 20, along with the coalition’s other funding needs. 
“We’re going to continue to move forward with that ask from the Legislature, because we don’t know what’s going to happen,” she said. “And we can’t be in a spot if the Trump administration decides to pull [funding] willy-nilly.”
Without the Legislature providing some financial security, Silva stressed another abrupt HUD funding cut would have far-reaching consequences.
“It’s really going to be catastrophic for New Mexico, and not just for people that become unhoused,” she said. “The impact that it’s going to have on the economy, in general, the landlords that will not have tenants in their units, et cetera. It’s really going to have an impact across the state of New Mexico.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/IMG_9295-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 11:58:20.327181

First, Hoskins has previously stated he won’t accept any signatures collected before Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the bill in October. That decision impacts around 92,000 signatures. Testifying in a Cole County courtroom on Monday in a lawsuit challenging Hoskins’ decision, the state’s director of elections said those signatures would be separated, scanned for preservation, but not distributed to county election officials for verification until Judge Chris Limbaugh rules on whether Hoskins must accept them. 
Second, a Trump-appointed federal judge threw out a lawsuit Monday that argued a referendum on redistricting was unconstitutional. In the ruling, the judge said state court was the proper venue if Hoskins believes the referendum violates the constitution. That could set the stage for yet another legal showdown over the power of voters to overturn the actions of the legislature. 
Federal judge rejects Missouri AG’s push to block referendum on gerrymandered map

Missouri has eight congressional districts, with six currently represented by Republicans. 
The 5th District, based in Kansas City and represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver since 2005, is carved up under the new map with portions attached to the 4th and 6th Districts. Heavily Republican areas stretching along the Missouri River to Boone County would be added to the remaining Kansas City portions.
The intended result is a map where Republicans hold seven of the state’s eight seats. 
The day lawmakers passed the new map, People Not Politicians submitted paperwork with the secretary of state’s office for a referendum. Of the 27 times a referendum has been placed on the Missouri ballot, voters have rejected the General Assembly’s actions all but twice — including overturning a congressional map in 1922.
The last time a referendum campaign was deployed was in 2019, when the secretary of state’s office used procedural maneuvers to successfully derail a push to overturn newly-passed restrictions on abortion. The move sparked a lawsuit, and in 2022 the Missouri Supreme Court ruled the laws the secretary of state used to obstruct the citizen-initiated referendum process were unconstitutional.

Attorneys are asking for a timeout — arguing in federal court Monday that the public’s money shouldn’t be given to the Cleveland Browns, especially without telling Ohioans.
From a few dollars to nearly $300,000 for a Northeast Ohio animal shelter, unclaimed funds contain money left behind.
It’s money that attorney Jeff Crossman says belongs to its rightful owners — the people of Ohio.
“Taking someone’s property and giving it to somebody else, a private owner, for some other private use is unconstitutional,” Crossman said in an interview. “It’s a handout to the Cleveland Browns.”
This summer, the state lawmakers decided to give the Browns a $600 million performance grant for their new Brook Park stadium using unclaimed funds.
Ohio’s Division of Unclaimed Funds currently oversees about $4.9 billion in funds, including forgotten bank accounts, utility deposits, uncashed checks, and more.
To check for unclaimed funds, visit unclaimedfunds.ohio.gov.
Crossman asked U.S. District Court Judge Edmund Sargus, Jr. to prohibit the state from using the cash while the legal fight plays out.
“It’s kind of similar to an eminent domain situation,” Crossman said. “If they’re going to take your house, they’re supposed to send you notice and give you an opportunity to object. They’re not doing that.”
In testimony on Monday, Unclaimed Funds Finance Director Amy Schellhammer admitted that they have not provided any direct notice to Ohioans, nor is it listed on their website, that $1.7-1.9 billion in unclaimed funds will be taken on Jan. 1, 2026.
Witnesses on each side debated the efficacy of the website, with one calling it the equivalent of a “local dog shelter’s” website.
There were thousands of entries that the expert witness analyzed that had addresses that were possibly outdated, non-existent zip codes, and frequently misspelled names.
The errors on the website were all due to people entering their information wrong to the banks or other holders of money, a witness for the defense said.
The state’s attorneys declined to do an interview, but previously, Senate President Rob McColley, R-Napoleon, argued that it’s constitutional and that press coverage has helped raise awareness for the unclaimed funds process.
“Kind of having this as a PSA ‘Hey, we have an unclaimed fund, go check, get your money out,'” McColley said in June.
Republicans argue that they are taking funds that have been unclaimed since before Jan. 1, 2016, and that this will help economic development.
“It’s not just a Browns deal,” Senate Finance Chair Jerry Cirino, R-Kirtland, said. “It is a setting aside of money from the unclaimed funds for other projects in the future, some that we don’t even know about at this point.”
That is exactly the problem, Crossman said.
“There are a lot of professional sports teams in Ohio, right here in Columbus, you have the Blue Jackets, you have the Bengals down the road, and there are minor league teams, and there are a lot of businesses that might have their hand out, too,” Crossman said.
This sets a terrible precedent, he said.
“I understand the legislature was trying to be creative, and they’re pounding their chest and saying, ‘Hey, we’re not raising taxes.’ Well, no, they’re not raising taxes, they’re just taking your property — and that’s worse.”
During the summary portion of the day-long hearing, the plaintiffs argued that the state was “money laundering,” and the judge needed to issue the preliminary injunction because the defendants were unlawfully taking money without notification.
Defense attorney Aneca Lasley, representing the state, argued that there was no merit to the case, the law doesn’t require notification, and the “passage” of H.B. 96 was enough notice.
The public “is required” to be aware of what the legislators are doing, she added.
Judge Sargus went back and forth with each side, but told Crossman and his team that they had a “hill” to climb to get the injunction.
The judge said he was to determine if the law was constitutional, and “not here to decide if it’s a good idea or not.”
He may have a ruling as soon as Tuesday on whether the preliminary injunction will be granted, he said.

Andrew Ireland filed a measure to impeach ""rogue"" prosecutors and judges. He is pictured at a rally at the Indiana Statehouse on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana prosecutors hope to fend off a proposed constitutional amendment they say could politicize prosecutorial decision-making — and, on Tuesday, released their own suggested legislative fixes.
“When we’re in a big room together, to be honest, I’m not sure who I’m sitting next to, a Republican or Democratic prosecutor,” Wabash County Prosecutor Bill Hartley said.

“Candidly, we don’t care, because at the end of the day, we all have the same goal, and that’s public safety,” said Hartley, who is the president of the Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys Council’s board of directors.
The 10-member board of prosecutors governs IPAC, a judicial branch agency that supports Indiana’s 91 elected prosecuting attorneys, as well as their chief deputies.
The agency is mobilizing against a disciplinary proposal filed last week by freshman Rep. Andrew Ireland, R-Indianapolis.
“I just filed my Constitutional amendment to let Indiana IMPEACH rogue judges and prosecutors who refuse to hold violent criminals accountable,” Ireland posted to X.
IPAC’s leaders “stand in complete agreement that we’re opposed to” the measure, according to Hartley.
Leaders believe Ireland’s rhetoric is “oversimplifying” the complex criminal justice system, Hartley said. “These are systematic issues that mislead the public.”
“We don’t have a rogue prosecutor issue in Indiana,” he added. “We feel like this is something that Andrew Ireland is using that term for political points and to get hits on his social media sites.”
Ireland accused prosecutors of trying to sidestep accountability in a Tuesday statement on X.
“It’s telling that the Association of Indiana Prosecuting Attorneys’ top priority today isn’t violent crime or public safety — it’s protecting their own from accountability,” he said.
“The Association believe their members should continue to enjoy a special carve-out from accountability. I don’t buy that for a second, and I don’t think Hoosiers do either,” the statement read. “Hundreds of thousands of Americans have celebrated this proposal online, and Elon Musk put it plainly: This ‘(h)as to be done nationwide.’ When people across the country are saying the same thing, maybe the problem isn’t my amendment, maybe it’s the culture of zero accountability.”
Constitutional changes coming?
IPAC leaders pointed to an existing provision in the state Constitution that allows prosecutors and circuit court judges convicted of “corruption or other high crime” to be removed from office. The document says the Indiana Supreme Court can force them out, or it can be done “in such other manner as may be prescribed by law.”
It’s unclear how often officeholders are removed under that provision.
Elkhart County Prosecutor Vicki Becker said ethics rules add another layer of accountability for prosecutors and judges.
“What we’ve seen recently is that when a prosecutor has done something where they have violated the oath of office, they step down from an ethical perspective, rather than having to be forced out by an impeachment,” said Becker, who is IPAC’s secretary and treasurer.
All are also up for election next year.

Ireland’s House Joint Resolution 1, however, would add prosecutors and circuit court judges to impeachment provisions.
One of those sections currently deals with state officers. Under his proposal, they could be removed from office for “crime, incapacity, or negligence” — through impeachment in the Indiana House, a trial in the Senate, or a joint resolution approved by both chambers.
They would also be added to a subsequent section specifying that state and local officers can be impeached, or removed from office, as “prescribed by law.”
“Right now, the Indiana Constitution holds the Governor, Lieutenant Governor, Secretary of State, Auditor, and Treasurer to an impeachment standard from crime, incapacity or negligence,” Ireland said. “My proposed amendment (H.J.R. 1) simply says that state-funded Circuit Judges and Prosecuting Attorneys should be held to that exact same standard.”
IPAC leaders argued the proposal “undermines” prosecutors’ freedom to make their own decisions.
“When you have words like negligence floating around out there, it opens up so many opportunities for people who just politically disagree, or who have malice or they have some other agenda,” Becker said. “That then gives them a basis to distract prosecutors from doing their work and instead make it political.”
Madison County Prosecutor Rodney Cummings, another IPAC board member, said Ireland’s proposed changes are “not in the best interest of justice.”

“How is a prosecutor going to feel that he has the discretion to make a decision in an individual case when he’s looking over his shoulder …?” Cummings said. “… We have to have the freedom to make decisions that are in the best interest of the victims, the state and criminal defendants.”
“Rogue” prosecutor proposals have repeatedly been filed in recent years, but haven’t gone very far. Often cited as pretext is Marion County Prosecutor Ryan Mears.
“I’m not here to defend the Marion County prosecutor,” Cummings said. “We have very different political philosophies, but the reality is, he takes a lot of criticism for things he has no control over.”
Police, prosecutors and judges must work in concert — using the statutes lawmakers write — to maintain an effective criminal justice system, the IPAC leaders said.
Cummings gave an example of two drivers — one in Marion County and the other in Madison County — who each killed multiple people in police chase crashes weeks apart in 2023. Both were sentenced this year.
In the Indianapolis case, Mears asked for 25 years in prison, but a judge sentenced the driver to two years behind bars and seven of home detention. In the Anderson case, the driver was sentenced to 35 years.
Agency readies own fixes
IPAC on Tuesday released an alternative legislative agenda to “address violent crime and frequent felons.”
The platform includes mandatory minimum executed sentences for certain violent offenses or repeat offenders.
Becker noted Indiana Code contains a “very small” list of offenses with non-suspendable sentences and said it should be expanded.
Judges “can actually impose even a home detention … to satisfy that non-suspendable part,” she added. “That’s why this statutory framework is so important, because judges can find ways to, I suppose, find those loopholes. And that’s not what our communities want.”

Cummings also argued good time credits for prison sentences have gone too far, with offenders getting “massive time cuts for things that have nothing to do with” rehabilitation.
Another goal is the expansion of “preventative” detention, when people accused of crimes are incarcerated before trial in an effort to avert future criminal acts.
“It’s almost like the criminal justice system has to be reactive because we haven’t been given the tools to be proactive,” Becker said.
Money is additionally a top priority.
About 83% of prosecutors’ offices are understaffed, according to Hartley, even as the number of criminal case filings trends higher. IPAC leaders said poorer and more rural counties particularly struggle to pay wages competitive enough to draw in prosecutorial staff.
Lawmakers put an appropriation into a prosecutor bill last session, but nixed it later after a dismal revenue forecast.
“Is it going to cost money? Yes, it is. The question is … What’s it worth to you?” Becker said. ” … This is what our taxpayer dollars are supposed to go for, is public safety.”
“It’s symbolism over substance all day long, and it’s just not getting the job done,” she added.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)The state of Alaska has settled lawsuits against Juul and Altria, two nicotine vapor manufacturers, for a combined $7.8 million, the state Department of Law said on Friday.
The suits were part of a nationwide pattern: Alaska and other U.S. states had alleged that the companies deliberately targeted children with advertising, something that likely contributed to a surge in nicotine use among children and young adults.
Altria settled Alaska’s lawsuit for $2 million last year, and the state announced a $5.8 million consent judgment with Juul on Friday.
Under the settlements, neither Juul nor Altria must admit fault, but both must abide by marketing restrictions. One key point in the settlement: Juul can’t use cartoons to advertise its products.
“This case took five years and a great deal of work from our public health and consumer
protection teams, but it was worth it,” said Alaska Attorney General Stephen Cox, in a prepared statement.
“We now have strong court-enforceable limits on how these companies can operate in
Alaska, and we’ve obtained a per-capita recovery that ranks near the top nationally, with
those dollars going straight into prevention and consumer protection.” 
Alaska was one of the last states in the country to settle with Juul, which has already paid more than $1 billion to states across the country.
Some states have since filed additional lawsuits against vape distributors, alleging that they contributed to a surge in nicotine vapor use among children and young adults.
Money from Alaska’s Juul settlement is to be paid over the next five years.
Under the financial terms of the consent judgment, half of the proceeds would be used to fund tobacco control and prevention programs, and the other half would go to the Department of Law’s consumer protection program.
Typically, the spending of money earned in financial judgments must be approved by the Alaska Legislature before becoming official.
“The use of vapes and other nicotine products among youth in Alaska remains a concern,” said Alaska Department of Health Commissioner Heidi Hedberg in a prepared statement. “This funding will help families and communities continue to access education, prevention, and cessation programs.”

(Photo via U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement)A midcoast city has restricted local assistance with federal immigration enforcement.
In a 4-1 vote Tuesday night, the Rockland City Council passed a measure to amend the city code to prohibit city employees and departments from assisting or cooperating with, or allow any municipal money or resources to be used for, any federal agency in any immigration enforcement operation, except where legally required to do so by state or federal law or court order. 
That includes barring city employees from allowing federal immigration agencies access to a person being detained by, or in the custody of, the Rockland Police Department or transferring people into federal custody, unless presented with a valid and properly issued judicial warrant or as part of the department’s investigation of a serious crime, such as human or drug trafficking.
The ordinance also bans the city from sharing immigration statuses and other personal information about residents with immigration officials, which comes as President Donald Trump’s administration is seeking voter and other data for citizenship probes.
“Measures like this preserve local resources for local priorities, ensure Maine towns and cities are not complicit in or liable for federal abuses of power, and improve public safety by building trust between local law enforcement and the communities they are supposed to serve,” Michael Kebede, policy director for the the American Civil Liberties Union of Maine, said in a statement. 
The ACLU of Maine helped develop the ordinance and hopes its passage will encourage Gov. Janet Mills to allow a related bill to become state law. 
LD 1971 would prevent state and local law enforcement from detaining someone solely on the basis of a federal immigration-related request. The Maine Legislature passed the proposal in June, but Mills postponed her decision on the bill until lawmakers reconvene in January.

(Tero Vesalainen/Getty Images)A fight between President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis has dominated Florida House Speaker Danny Perez’s planned “artificial intelligence week” in the Legislature, intended to explore the technology.
Although Perez, a Miami Republican, had planned for weeks to use Dec. 8-12 committee hearings to analyze the effects of AI in different Florida industries, the topic took on a national angle when Trump announced early Monday that he would sign an executive order creating a national rule preventing states from handing down their own regulations.
That put him in direct conflict with DeSantis, who’s long-railed against the dangers of AI and last week rolled out a proposal called the “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights.”
“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week. You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something.”
Hours later, DeSantis indirectly responded on X, asserting, “An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action. Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation…I doubt Congress has the votes to pass this because it is so unpopular with the public.”
He referenced the U.S. House passing the “One Big Beautiful Bill” over the summer with a clause banning states from regulating AI for 10 years. The Senate voted 99-1 to strip that section out.
This is the latest — and most blatant — escalation in GOP politicos’ dispute over AI. DeSantis worries that unmonitored AI could usher in an age of “darkness and deceit” while Trump — allied with technology titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg — has for months toyed with banning state-level AI regulations.
This fiscal year alone, massive companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to invest more than $364 billion in the industry. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is pulling in roughly $13 billion in annual revenue while enjoying more than 800 million regular users.
And although the governor hopes lawmakers will crack down on AI data centers and “grooming” chatbots, and will protect consumer data from AI companies, a nationwide moratorium would severely limit the Legislature’s ability to do so.

From CalMatters homelessness reporter Marisa Kendall: 
Workers tasked with helping California’s largest homeless population are sounding an alarm, saying a recent upheaval at the Los Angeles County agency where they work has them scared for their livelihoods. 
In an open letter to the L.A. County Board of Supervisors, a handful of employees with the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority say threats of pending layoffs are affecting hundreds of county workers, and by extension, the thousands of homeless residents that they serve. 
The Homeless Services Authority is a joint city-county agency that oversees homeless services in L.A. County. After multiple critical audits, the county board of supervisors voted earlier this year to pull its funding from the joint authority and instead create a new county homelessness agency.
But as the county makes that transition, the employees doing the hard work of moving people off the streets and into housing worry they are getting left behind. Management has suggested there will be staff reductions, according to the employee letter. But workers don’t know who will get the chance to move to the new agency, and who won’t, Gilbert Youenes, a Homeless Services Authority employee, told CalMatters. Youenes evaluates homeless shelters in L.A. County to make sure they meet the county’s health and safety standards.

Youenes: “Some of us have been with LAHSA for decades. We have families. We have bills to pay. And we’re not sure how this is going to unfold and affect our lives. There’s a real sense of fear.”

The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority declined to comment on the letter. 
The employee letter also alleges that terminating Homeless Services Authority employees would violate the terms of Measure A — a half-cent sales tax that funds homeless housing and services in L.A. County, which voters approved last year. The measure includes a section, aimed at improving recruitment and retention of homeless services workers, which states that contracts funded through the tax must not displace public employees.

Feds backtrack on homelessness cuts

More from CalMatters’ Marisa:
President Donald Trump’s administration has reversed course, for now, on cuts that were expected to defund thousands of homeless housing units in California.
On Monday the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development withdrew a controversial funding notice that had made sweeping changes to federal homelessness policy. The notice had drastically cut how much funding local governments could spend on permanent housing — something prior administrations had prioritized as the solution to homelessness. Instead, the current administration focused on temporary shelters, particularly those that require sobriety. 
In two separate lawsuits, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s administration, Santa Clara County and San Francisco sued, accusing the federal housing department of illegally going over Congress’ head to make the changes.
In the court filing, federal lawyers said the administration withdrew the funding notice “in order to assess the issues raised by plaintiffs” and draft a new notice.



It’s dour out there

Most Californians believe the country is headed in the wrong direction, according to a new poll examining attitudes on Trump’s policies, California’s next governor and more.
On Monday the Public Policy Institute of California published its latest survey, which polled 1,676 adult Californians from Nov. 13-19. It found that 29% of likely voters approve of Trump’s job performance, with 4% of Democrats, 79% of Republicans and 21% of independent voters approving.
Seven in 10 also thought that Congress should have extended tax credits for Affordable Care Act enrollees, which were not included in the latest federal budget bill, and were at the center of the government shutdown that ended on Nov. 12.
Regarding the state’s gubernatorial election next year, more than half (56%) of likely voters approve of Newsom and 45% say they want his successor to continue his policies. Former Rep. Katie Porter is the leading candidate in the survey, though 40% aren’t satisfied with any of the candidates. 
The general outlook on the state and the country is also grim: 74% of likely voters believe the country is heading in the wrong direction, and the same percentage of people believe the U.S. will enter a depression by 2030. As the top issues cited since 2023, 36% of participants say the cost of living and the economy remain the chief problems for the state.

The company delivers gas for heating and cooking to customers in Fall River, the tenth-largest city in Massachusetts with a median household income less than half of the statewide average, along with eight surrounding towns like North Attleboro and Westport. 
“No matter how you slice it, for my district, this is exorbitant,” said Rep. Carole Fiola, a Democrat who represents Fall River. “This was a shock to a lot of people. It will be very difficult for many people to afford this increase.” 
It’s also a direct shot at Gov. Maura Healey’s affordability push. 
Healey has based her energy agenda on a drumbeat of policy steps aimed at addressing high gas and electric costs and reducing or removing charges from utility bills to save ratepayers money. Liberty’s rate increase, if approved, would prompt dramatic sticker shock in a Gateway City and directly fly in the face of Healey’s effort. 
DPU declined to comment on the rate case. 
Pamela Bellings, a spokesperson for Liberty, which is owned by Canada-based Algonquin Power & Utilities Corp., defended the rate request in a statement, saying that the company has made “substantial investments” to comply with new pipeline safety regulations and enhance system reliability. Liberty serves customers in New Hampshire, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri, in addition to Massachusetts. 
“We recognize the financial challenges many in our community are facing and have carefully assessed ways to smooth the impact to customer bills,” Bellings said. “A rate adjustment is necessary to help maintain compliance with all new regulations and continue delivering safe and reliable service to customers.” 
The company is now negotiating the rate hike proposal with the state attorney general and other groups. For now, though, Liberty ratepayers are in the lurch. 
Liberty’s rate hike request would raise monthly bills anywhere from $33 to $103 a month depending on the customer’s location and income level in order to recover nearly $95 million. The company last raised rates a decade ago, in 2015, it said in its DPU filing, and the majority of this request is to recover costs for pipe replacement and repair that are associated with the state’s Gas System Enhancement Plan, which have ballooned in recent years.  
Liberty is also seeking to recover costs for improvements to the company’s customer information system and the relocation of its headquarters in Fall River.  
If DPU approves Liberty’s plan, gas bills could rise 90 percent by 2030 — prompting “rate shock that will significantly burden ratepayers,” Timothy Newhard, a financial analyst in the state attorney general’s office, testified to the DPU in October. 
The pure size of the rate hike request is putting a spotlight on Liberty’s gas system infrastructure work to fix leaky old pipes, the main driver of the company’s proposed bill increases. Newhard goes a step further, adding that Liberty is looking to profit from its “budgetary mismanagement” by recovering more than $40 million in a deferred GSEP revenue balance and recommending that DPU limit Liberty’s ability to charge ratepayers for those costs under reforms that the department adopted earlier this year.   
The rate request has unsurprisingly attracted a large amount of scrutiny — and pointed criticism.  
Sen. Michael Rodrigues, chair of the Senate Ways and Means Committee whose district spans the South Coast, including Fall River, said that “now is not the time” for Liberty’s rate hike. 
“This move by Liberty, on the heels of a federal government that continues to shirk its responsibilities in providing food and housing subsidies, is unacceptable,” he said. “The cost of replacing their aging infrastructure should not be entirely borne by the consumer.” 
Healey, meanwhile, said in a statement that this proposal “could not come at a worse time for families and businesses in southeastern Mass.” 
“My administration will be pushing back in the review process and will oppose additional burdens on ratepayers,” she said. 
State officials, including Department of Energy Resources Commissioner Elizabeth Mahony, appeared at an October DPU hearing to oppose Liberty’s request, alongside irate members of the public.  
It’s the exact scenario Healey has increasingly tried to fend off. She blasted other more modest rate hike requests from the state’s larger utilities earlier this year, called on DPU to comprehensively review gas and electric rates to find ways to lower costs, and filed landmark energy affordability legislation that has yet to gain traction as the winter season hits. DPU approved gas rate increases for other companies of up to 30 percent last year, which prompted an outcry from consumers.  
“I, too, am concerned about the size of the rate increase proposed by Liberty,” Mahony said in the hearing. “People are struggling every day to afford rising energy bills, and the 55 percent increase in rates proposed by Liberty is shocking.” 
Dan Dolan, president of the New England Power Generators Association, said the rate request highlights the tradeoffs associated with the state’s decarbonization goals. Electrifying homes through heat pumps requires significant upfront capital costs but offers savings down the line. Slow uptake, however, means dealing with the burdensome transmission and supply costs of maintaining the gas distribution system. 
“The fact that that is now coinciding with the sharpest political refocus on electric affordability that has happened in decades in Massachusetts and frankly, across the nation, is going to create an extraordinarily politically volatile situation,” Dolan said. 
Liberty is also asking regulators to approve a 9.9 percent return on equity, which is the allowed rate of profit for the utility’s shareholders through capital investments. Though that rate of return isn’t out of the ordinary, it would still be tied for DPU’s highest approved return on equity in the past five years, according to Liberty’s own filings. 
The rate hike request has also spawned debates about what kinds of costs utilities should be allowed to recover from customers in the first place. The Energy & Policy Institute, a nonprofit watchdog organization, is pushing legislation in Massachusetts to bar utilities from using ratepayer money for lobbying, investor relations, litigation and DPU cases, and lavish expenses for boards of directors.  
Liberty’s rate case includes roughly $675,000 in these expenses, and removing these items would save ratepayers on average roughly $11 per year, according to the Energy & Policy Institute.  
Still, that represents a small fraction of the $80 average monthly bill increase that Liberty is seeking for Fall River customers.  
The state attorney general’s office said in DPU filings earlier this year regarding the utilities’ GSEP plans that the utilities have “little regard for targeted replacement and prudent cost management” under the Gas System Enhancement Program and that GSEP capital expenditures have increased by about 12 percent per year over the past decade because the companies have almost exclusively chosen to replace rather than repair leak-prone pipe.  
Liberty, like most other gas utilities in the state, did not “demonstrate compliance” with its 2024 GSEP work plan approved by DPU and exceeded its cap by nearly $38 million, according to the attorney general, money that the company is now attempting to recover. 
Getting DPU to approve such a large rate hike request will be a tall order, said Christopher Knittel, associate dean for climate and sustainability at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. But the fact that Liberty is requesting the bill increases in the first place cuts both ways. 
“It’s certainly possible that they’re trying to play a more complex bargaining game and that they are trying to settle on a number that is close to what they really need,” Knittel said. “The DPU will obviously try to cut costs wherever possible, but the fact that they’re asking for it in this environment might signal that these are actually really legitimate because this is not going to play well.”",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/CorrodedNaturalGasPipelineInspection-edited-1.png?fit=1024%2C767&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-09 09:58:08.721526

Sign up for their newsletter here.
More than 200 environmental organizations signed a letter to Congress supporting a national moratorium on the approval and construction of new data centers. The letter, sent Monday, highlights these centers’ impacts on water resources, electricity rates and greenhouse gas emissions.
Data centers often suck up large amounts of water to cool their computers. They require a lot of electricity to run their servers, often leading to higher regional utility rates and upgrades to the electricity grid to accommodate them. Some utilities are planning to build natural gas plants to serve the new load, while some data-center companies are even building their own plants, increasing local greenhouse gas emissions.
It is near-impossible to paint a complete picture of the energy and water use of data centers, and the corresponding climate impacts, given the limited data that companies provide. A November study in the journal Nature Sustainability predicted that, depending on the speed of expansion, the artificial intelligence industry could emit as much carbon dioxide each year as 10 million cars, Inside Climate News reported.
People across the country, from New York to Alabama, have opposed data center developments in their neighborhoods—with varying degrees of success. The letter states that environmental groups want to stop these developments until “adequate regulations can be enacted to fully protect our communities.”
In a prepared statement, Eric Weltman, senior New York organizer at Food & Water Watch, said: “It’s prudent that we press the pause button on Big Data’s voracious and expanding appetite for energy and water before it’s too late to prevent massive harm.”
Data-center boosters have touted the economic benefits of new construction, including tax revenue increases for local governments and new jobs for residents.
In October, Dan Diorio, the vice president of state policy at the Data Center Coalition, told NPR that companies are trying to reduce their water consumption, and to ensure they pay “the full cost of service for electricity.”
In New York, state leadership has taken a mainly supportive stance on data center development—Gov. Kathy Hochul recently told Bloomberg News that she wants to “let the tech industry know this is the place you want to be.”
But some communities in upstate New York have opposed data center development, particularly cryptocurrency mines that consume large amounts of energy to create bitcoin for profit. More recently, a potential AI data center in Lansing, a town near the state’s Finger Lakes region, has residents concerned about rising electricity costs and environmental problems.
“These slick corporations come into unsuspecting communities with the promise of job creation and tax revenues,” said Yvonne Taylor, the vice president of Seneca Lake Guardian, an organization that fights data centers near the Finger Lakes, and president of the National Coalition Against Cryptomining, which opposes them across the country.
Both organizations signed the letter. “The fact of the matter is that all of these machines … they’re all fully automated, and it doesn’t require a lot of people, so there aren’t a lot of jobs that are created, but the community is left with the consequences, including increased energy bills,” she said.
In Southern states, despite a largely supportive regulatory environment, some communities have mounted strong opposition to proposed data centers. In Bessemer, Alabama, the city council voted to rezone agricultural land to allow the construction of a new data center. This decision has divided the community, which is concerned about electricity rates, water use and potential air pollution from the on-site backup diesel generators.
Data centers use up so much power in certain states, like Virginia, that the regional electric grid operator will need to upgrade the transmission system that is essentially the backbone of the grid, according to Eric Gimon, an independent consultant who works as a technical expert and policy adviser with Energy Innovation, an energy and climate policy think tank.
Consumers usually subsidize those changes. A 2024 report from Virginia’s legislative watchdog agency found that households there could see their bills increase by an estimated $14 to $37 monthly by 2040 as a result.
Data centers’ high power usage also pushes up the forecasts for peak demand—the highest demand possible for a region’s grid. This can also affect household electricity rates.
“For all these things, there are solutions,” said Gimon. “It’s just a question of demanding the solutions get implemented.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Amazon_data_center.jpg,,,2025-12-09 09:58:08.721526
,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-09 13:52:53+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,Massachusetts lagging on implementation of data equity law,Jaya Savita and Danielle Kim,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/massachusetts-lagging-on-implementation-of-data-equity-policy/,"Over two years since the law’s passage, we have seen little progress and movement on implementation, and our residents are continuing to suffer the consequences.","FOR BLACK, INDIGENOUS, and communities of color, as well as other marginalized groups, data can drive greater visibility of residents’ needs—or perpetuate our historic invisibility. Thanks to the longstanding advocacy of community organizations, researchers, state Rep. Tackey Chan and the House Asian Caucus, Massachusetts passed the most expansive data equity policy in the nation, embedding this language into the 2024 budget, which Governor Maura Healey signed into law in August 2023.  
These provisions require all state agencies that already collect race and ethnicity information to further disaggregate it by every major Asian, Pacific Islander, Black and African American, Latino, and white or Caucasian subgroup. This is vitally important given the growing diversity of Massachusetts residents and the persistence of significant disparities, both among different racial categories and within communities themselves.  
For example, consider educational outcomes among Black residents. Nearly half of Nigerian residents in Greater Boston hold a bachelor’s degree or higher, compared to 15 percent of Black Haitians and 10 percent of Cape Verdean residents. Among Latino residents, approximately two-thirds of Guatemalan and Salvadoran workers in Massachusetts are limited English proficient—compared to fewer than 20 percent of Puerto Rican residents, contributing to major disparities in employment and economic outcomes.  
For the local Asian-American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) community, this policy is especially consequential and timely given the findings from the recent “No Longer Invisible” report —demonstrating the perniciousness of the “model minority” stereotype, which has characterized the nation’s Asian population as high-achieving economically, and therefore ignoring the intersecting challenges facing working-class Asian Americans.  
Consider the current food insecurity crisis. While Asian American households in Massachusetts, on average, experience food insecurity at rates comparable to white residents and lower than other racial groups, data findings like these often mask critical needs within the diverse AAPI community. Importantly, 46.1 percent of Cambodian families receive SNAP benefits, as do 25.5 percent of Vietnamese families, compared to 16 percent of all families statewide. 
The data equity law represents a significant milestone in not only overcoming harmful racial biases in data, but also opening the door for greater intentionality and effectiveness in delivering state programs. Food distribution, postsecondary readiness programs, and job training programs funded by the state could all be better tailored and targeted to meet the distinct needs of specific ethnic populations. 
But as we know from many other state policies, it all comes down to implementation—and the data equity law presents a historic opportunity for innovation and community engagement. Accordingly, the law included a significant runway for implementation, with the Executive Office for Administration and Finance tasked with creating guidelines by January 2025, and the law itself not going into effect until January 2026. 
Yet, over two years since the law’s passage, we have seen little progress and movement on implementation, and our residents are continuing to suffer the consequences. As community leaders, we are ready to partner with state advocates in the coming months to ensure that this policy is implemented with fidelity and intentionality. Here are some key steps that Massachusetts can take to deliver on the promise of data equity:  
1. Sequence implementation by starting with the Executive Office of Health and Human Services 
As the state’s largest single agency, accounting for over 50 percent of the state’s annual budget, EOHHS plays a central role in the delivery of key programs. Particularly given the changing federal landscape and funding instability, data-informed decisions are even more critical. The state must begin implementation within EOHHS because it is the initial, and often primary, touch point for working class, immigrant, and most marginalized individuals in our communities. By doing so, we will be able to better understand the demographics and ethnic makeup of all communities seeking public health services and support across the Commonwealth. 
2. Convene a Data Equity Community Advisory Committee 
Establishing a Community Advisory Committee composed of diverse stakeholders, including legislators, advocates, public health experts, and researchers, is a necessary step to ensure that implementation is fully inclusive and reflective of our communities. Moreover, the state needs to dedicate funding to host several public hearings in multiple languages and geographical regions, in partnership with this community advisory committee, ensuring that all community voices are heard.  
3. Invest in greater training and resources for our state agency workers 
Capacity matters, and just as Massachusetts law requires every state agency to create a language access plan and appoint a language access coordinator, so too must the state fund the development of comparable data equity plans and coordinator roles within each agency. Furthermore, additional funding is needed to provide trainings and resources for agency staff to implement the new data collection requirements outlined in this law. Accordingly, we urge state leaders to allocate funding in the fiscal year 2027 state budget to support these vital activities. 
Massachusetts faces intersecting public health challenges — from rising food insecurity and housing instability to widening economic and racial inequities, all compounded by the current deportation crisis. Additional investments in data disaggregation are urgently needed to fully understand how working class, immigrant, and Black, Indigenous, and People of Color communities are being impacted by current policies, where gaps in services and resources exist, and to strengthen the infrastructure to protect data privacy in the face of federal threats. 
The nation is once again looking to Massachusetts to be a beacon for innovation. Particularly in this political climate, where data privacy laws are being destroyed by the Trump administration, Massachusetts must stand firm in our commitment to data equity and privacy. We cannot afford to squander this pivotal moment, and we need our state leaders to prioritize the planning and implementation of the data equity law.

In lawsuits, women have accused 83 officers of sexual misconduct.","In summary
A new report on discipline in California prisons highlights slow handling of several sex assault cases filed against officers. In lawsuits, women have accused 83 officers of sexual misconduct. 


Five California correctional officers who were accused of sexually assaulting incarcerated people over the last dozen years remain employed by the state, according to a new audit from the state prisons’ inspector general. 
The audit, released last week, is a twice-a-year summary of how the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation addresses complaints about its staff members. Overall, the inspector general found fault with the internal affairs department’s investigations into prison guard misconduct.
The audit labeled 86% of the prison system’s internal affairs disciplinary and criminal caseload as “inadequate” or “needs improvement” — only 14% of the cases handled by the internal affairs department were rated “adequate.” Inadequate means there were significant problems with the investigation that affected its final outcome. The less-serious label, “needs improvement,” meant that the process had problems, but none so serious that they compromised the investigation. 
It comes as the department faces what the report called “a wave” of lawsuits from incarcerated and formerly incarcerated women who allege they were sexually abused by prison staff. The audit said at least 279 women have sued the department, and they have accused at least 83 prison employees of sexual misconduct.
The inspector general report does not include the names of the officers or even identify the prisons where they work, which is in keeping with its past disciplinary audits. The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation did not immediately return calls and emails seeking comment for this story. 
California has two prisons that primarily house women. At the larger prison, the Central California Women’s Facility in Chowchilla, former guard Gregory Rodriguez was found guilty of 64 counts of sexual abuse in January, The Fresno Bee reported, and later sentenced to 224 years in prison. 
Thirteen incarcerated or formerly incarcerated women testified against him. A 2023 investigation by The Guardian found that women had made reports about Rodriguez as early as 2014. He worked at the prison until 2022.
As Rodriguez’s case unfolded, the inspector general’s office learned of other sex assault lawsuits. The inspector general’s office in the new report said it looked at 68 cases and it faulted prison lawyers for being too slow in referring names to internal investigators who could have developed disciplinary cases against officers.
On average, the audit said it took nine months for the corrections department’s legal staff to send cases to internal investigators. “Delayed investigation of sexual assault significantly impairs the integrity and effectiveness of the investigative process,” the audit said.
The audit then described three cases involving six officers, five of whom continue to work for state prisons. 
In a separate case not connected to the “wave” of lawsuits, internal investigators took so long to review allegations of sexual assault that a lieutenant accused by a dozen women was able to retire before facing discipline, the audit said.
The inspector general’s office wrote that the officer allegedly traded chewing gum, a radio and marijuana for sexual favors between 2021 and 2023, and then lied to the prison system’s internal affairs unit when asked about it. 
The internal affairs unit “unnecessarily delayed the completion of the investigation, which prevented the department from imposing discipline for some allegations,” the audit found. 
Other violations ranged from minor administrative chicanery, like two guards who allegedly faked the numbers in a prisoner count so they could use the time to eat Thanksgiving dinner instead, to allegations that a prison guard loudly, publicly and untruthfully indicated to other inmates that a prisoner was acting as an informant. 
The audit reflects a chaotic process for even routine investigations. In a January 2024 case, one of eight prison guards who had broken up a fight struck an incarcerated person with a baton, even though the incarcerated person had already “disengaged.” 
The Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation was aware of the case in January 2024, according to the lawsuit, but didn’t refer it to internal affairs until June 2024, according to the audit. An investigator didn’t start conducting interviews until August 2024. Then the case was reassigned to a second investigator, who didn’t start interviews until November 2024, and tried to close the case without interviewing the incarcerated person, the guard who allegedly struck him or any witnesses. 
Then, the second investigator went on extended leave, handing the case off to a third investigator who had weeks to wrap up an investigation that is supposed to take months to complete. Ultimately, the prison system was handed a case four days before the deadline for disciplinary action with “a wholly deficient investigative report.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/051821-Corrections-Medical-Parole-AP-CM-01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-09 13:57:13.907869

They keep kids alive in dangerous times,Ayo Banjo,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/school-counselors-youth-suicide-california/,"With suicide and violence stalking students, counselors are often the first to notice kids in trouble. They're also among the first to lose their jobs to budget cuts.","Guest Commentary written by

Ayo Banjo
Ayo Banjo leads a stigma reduction campaign funded through the California Youth Behavioral Health Initiative.


Weeks after a student and staff member were stabbed and four students arrested at Watsonville High, the school district that serves them is considering laying off every mental health clinician and most of its school counselors. 
If you want a snapshot of how we are failing young people, especially boys, you can start there. 
To balance its budget, the Pajaro Valley Unified School District is considering eliminating the equivalent of 15 full-time counselors, all 13 mental health clinicians and dozens of intervention staff at its schools  —  at a time when youth suicide is one of the leading causes of death for people ages 10 to 24. 
Men and boys make up nearly 80% of suicides in the United States, a rate almost four times higher than for women. For LGBTQ youth, the picture is even more alarming. A national survey found nearly 39% seriously considered suicide in the past year, and 12% attempted it. 
This crisis is not abstract. It is here. It is now. And it is local. 
Young people rely most heavily on school-based support, so if you remove counselors and clinicians, you remove the adults best positioned to intervene when a student’s silence becomes dangerous. 
And when we talk about violence, context matters. What we frame as “school safety” is often a reflection of untreated pain. 
When a boy explodes, we see a threat. When a boy shuts down, we assume he is fine. We rarely name what both can be — symptoms of a system that teaches boys to swallow everything and then acts surprised when the pressure finally breaks. 
I see this every week in my work as project director of a countywide stigma reduction campaign on the Central Coast. 
Our youth ambassadors — many of them Black, brown or LGBTQ — lead a movement called Break the Stigma Not the Vibe. They design billboards, bus ads and schoolwide messaging rooted in language they needed when they were younger.
Asking for help with no one to answer
Their message is simple: Asking for help is strength. You don’t have to go through this alone. And you deserve to be seen before you collapse. 
Their words will soon move across the Central Coast on buses and corridors, reaching thousands of students who may not talk to a teacher or open up at home. Sometimes visibility is the intervention.
Now, imagine pairing that visibility with the removal of every trained mental health professional on campus. That is the contradiction this moment demands we confront. You cannot cut lifelines in a suicide crisis and call it a safety strategy. 
School counselors and clinicians are not extras; they are core safety infrastructure. They are the adults who notice when a student stops being themselves, when grades slip, when friendships change or when a child who laughs easily is suddenly withdrawn. 
We have to stop treating mental health as a side conversation. These cuts are happening in winter — when depression, isolation and suicidal ideation increase. 
They are happening in communities still recovering from violence, and after the federal government removed the “Press 3”  LGBTQ-specific option on the national 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline — a resource that has supported more than a million people. We are watching lifelines shrink at the moment young people need more of them. 
California has invested heavily in youth behavioral health in recent years. But investment means little if school boards eliminate the positions that translate those state dollars into daily, life-saving support.
If we are serious about preventing suicide, especially among boys and historically marginalized youth, then counselors, clinicians and trusted adults must be the last thing on the chopping block — not the first. 
I say this not just as someone who works in mental health, but as someone who has lost people I love to suicide. Sometimes the difference between survival and silence is a single adult who knows your name and notices when your light dims. 
We have a choice in front of us. We can keep cutting lifelines and hope for the best. Or we can decide that in a youth suicide crisis, the most dangerous decision we can make is to remove the people who keep kids alive.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/021125-ICE-Schools-Salinas-LV_27.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-09 08:56:12.068379

They’ve criticized the arrests, saying they force immigrants into the shadows, undermine the legal immigration process and unnecessarily separate families. 
That was the case for one man who went to the office last week for a green card interview with his wife and child, said attorney Adam Crayk. The young father was arrested, with immigration agents saying he overstayed a visa and citing a mark on his juvenile record that had since been expunged, Crayk said. 
Prior to this year’s immigration crackdown, an old case in juvenile court didn’t tend to land someone on the radar of immigration enforcers, Crayk said. While another of his clients who was detained at the Citizenship and Immigration Services office had a prior criminal conviction, he said last week, a third did not.

The federal agency did not comment on criticism of the detentions, but told Utah News Dispatch in a statement Monday that people may be apprehended at its offices if they “are identified as having outstanding warrants; being subject to court-issued removal orders; or having committed fraud, crimes, or other violations of immigration law while in the United States.” 
In an announcement last month, the agency said it was working with multiple agencies “to enforce immigration law and protect public safety.” Its referrals to law enforcers resulted in the apprehension of almost 2,000 people at its facilities around the country since Jan. 20, the date of Trump’s inauguration, the announcement said.
At the protest Monday, Charlie Padilla, of Layton, led the crowd in a chant of “DHS, let’s be clear, immigrants are welcome here!” He told Utah News Dispatch that those applying for green cards and other authorization at the office don’t represent the “worst of the worst” that Trump had said immigration operations would target. 
“It’s unacceptable,” Padilla said.

Protester Carmen Cancino held a sign saying “First things first: Love thy neighbor!” 
Standing outside the office with her daughters, ages 2 and 14, Cancino said she understands why immigration agents may arrest people convicted of crimes, but not those without a criminal record. 
She said she knew of someone who was scheduled to go to the office a few weeks ago. 
“She didn’t come to her appointment, because she was scared that they were going to take her,” Cancino said. 
Protest organizer Liz Maryon, with the Salt Lake Community Bail Fund, kept track as people came and went from appointments inside, and urged protesters to cheer in support for those who left without issue. Maryon said after the protest concluded that no one appeared to be arrested Monday.

(Will McLelland/Alabama Reflector)A University of Alabama alumni organization is raising money to support two student publications shut down by the administration last week. 
Media Alumni Seeking to Highlight Equity and Diversity (MASTHEAD), said in a statement Sunday the organization has launched a fundraising campaign to raise $25,000 to support Nineteen Fifty-Six a Black lifestyle and culture magazine and Alice, a women’s magazine.
The funds will go towards helping both magazines independently publish for the Spring 2026 semester. It is unknown if the publications will retain their names.

Victor Luckerson, President of MASTHEAD and a journalist and author, said in a  statement alumni and people who care about student journalism should step up to support the publications. 
“We have to build infrastructure that allows us to not only survive but thrive at a moment when so many voices are being stifled because of government and university overreach. This is a national issue, but the work starts in our own community,” the statement said.
In the same statement, Nineteen Fifty-Six Magazine Editor-in-Chief Kendal Wright and Alice Editor-In-Chief Gabrielle Gunter said they would fight to keep their publications alive. 
“But I think this experience has taught our community and our staff that there is always another way. We will always have a space to tell our stories, and we will always make one. We cannot be silenced,” Wright said in the statement.
Gunter said the suspension has upset the publication’s staff members to the point of protest.
“My staff is devastated, but I will also say we’re angry, and the university would have a hard time shutting us up right now. Given that these two magazines tell such important stories that other student publications might not be able to, getting censored is egregious,” Gunter said in the statement.
On Dec. 1, The University of Alabama notified members of Nineteen Fifty-Six Magazine and Alice Magazine that both publications would be suspended for not being in compliance with federal guidance on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.
The university cited a July memo from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi released this summer that made non-binding recommendations on how to remain in compliance with anti-DEI policies supported by the Trump administration. The university has also cited the memo in claiming it cannot reopen spaces for LGBTQ students and UA’s Black Student Union. 
Alabama’s closure of the publications has drawn national attention as well as criticism on campus. A petition was started on MoveOn to reinstate both magazines saying their suspension is “direct attack on free speech on a college campus.” As of early Monday evening, it had over 2,800 signatures.
On Friday, the University of Alabama Chapter of the Association of the American Association of University Professors sent a letter to University of Alabama President Peter Mohler; Academic Affairs Provost Lesley Reid and Vice President of Student Life Steven Hood saying they “dispute the administration’s legal rationale for closing these publications and stand in solidarity with the students who produce and read them.”
“Your decision to suspend these publications not only violates these students’ First Amendment rights, it also tarnishes the reputation of the University of Alabama as a space that welcomes all students,” the statement said. 
The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) has also criticized the decision to close Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six, writing in a letter sent to UA last Wednesday that the school “may not retaliate against an editorially independent student publication based on its content or viewpoint.” 
“Once a university recognizes a student publication, it cannot act as a censor,” the letter said.
Since the suspension, the university has said UA staff “hope to work with students to develop a new publication that features a variety of voices and perspectives to debut in the next academic year.”
MASTHEAD is a non-profit organization that advocates for “diverse, anti-racist and equitable student media at the University of Alabama.” The organization, founded in 2020, provides financial support and mentorship to student journalists at UA to “promote a more inclusive environment.
The funding would cover the cost of student salaries, printing and equipment needs.
Luckerson said in an interview Monday printing costs for the magazines is typically $7,500 with student budgets per magazine being $5,000. He also said there are unknown costs for publication.
“We don’t quite know what it’s going to cost yet for space, for example, we don’t know where the students are going to work. You know, that might involve renting space on or off campus. We don’t know yet, so we want to make sure we have some money also for that purpose,”he said.
Fundraising updates can be tracked on Givebutter. As of early Monday evening $12,300 had been raised.
Luckerson said the support for the fundraiser has gotten more than 100 individual donors so far with donations ranging from $5 to $500.
“That just shows that everyone, no matter how much they have, is willing to contribute something to make this happen. Because I think alumni and students are so passionate about making sure that authentic voices are still able to be heard on the University of Alabama campus,” he said.
Luckerson said the university overreached by shutting down Nineteen Fifty-Six and Alice.
“I don’t think, I mean, there’s anything wrong with creating work that represents the people into different groups on campus,” he said. “It’s not wrong to have Essence or Vogue as magazines we can all enjoy on the newsstand. And so I see why it’d be wrong to have similar content being produced on campus.”

,California,2025-12-09 13:01:00+00:00,CalMatters,"Who’s seeking fire aid for Los Angeles, candidate Newsom or Gov. Newsom?",Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/12/gavin-newsom-wildfire-aid-plea/,President Trump and Republicans in Congress last week ignored Gov. Gavin Newsom's requests for fire aid. Newsom has been critical of them recently.,"California Gov. Gavin Newsom, an all-but-certain candidate for president in 2028, jumped at the chance to address a forum of business executives and other A-list figures last week and burnish his credentials as President Donald Trump’s most vocal critic.
He excoriated attendees at a New York Times-sponsored event for being too accommodating of Trump, whom he accused of undermining democracy. He even suggested they should acquire the parody kneepads he’s selling, for “groveling to Trump’s needs.”
“Some of you may need to buy them in bulk,” he said.
“Some of you are probably fine with it,” Newsom said as he ticked off Trump’s authoritarian policies. “A lot of people figured it out. They know the game, state capitalism, crony capitalism, the great grift. A lot of you are doing extraordinarily well.”
It was exactly what to expect from someone eyeing the White House, who hopes that positioning himself as Trump’s resistor-in-chief would give him a leg up on other Democratic contenders.
Politico, a website devoted to politics, quoted an unnamed Newsom advisor as saying his confrontational presentation was deliberate. “So he came prepared to tell the truth,” the advisor said.
A day later, Newsom landed in Washington, doffed his presidential candidate hat, donned his gubernatorial chapeau and asked Republicans who control Congress and the White House to give California $34 billion to help Los Angeles County communities recover from deadly wildfires that swept through the region nearly a year ago.
“As the fire response has shifted into long-term recovery, the focus now is on rebuilding homes, schools, utilities and critical infrastructure while also supporting small businesses and job growth in the impacted region,” Newsom told congressional leaders in a letter, adding, “As in past and current disasters, complete recovery is not possible without essential federal aid. The state of California continues to respectfully request a supplemental appropriation for disaster funding to support key programs to aid survivors.”
Respectfully? Newsom implies that he can portray Trump and other Republicans as agents of the devil and immediately ask them for many billions of dollars to help his very blue state recover from disaster.
The two days on the eastern seaboard encapsulate the bifurcated image Newsom will display during his final year as governor — aggressive candidate for the White House and chief executive of the nation’s largest state.
There are conflicts as Newsom juggles the two roles, with his pleas for wildfire aid being an obvious one.
He knows that Trump demands obsequiousness from anyone seeking  favors — exactly what Newsom cited in his New York presentation. The flip side of Trump’s alpha-male psyche is that if flattery is not forthcoming, the seeker will likely be shunned.

“Back in January, the president looked me in the eye on the tarmac at LAX and promised me, and the people of LA, that he’d ‘take care of it’ as we rebuild and recover,” Newsom said in a statement. “That commitment isn’t being met, and instead he’s leaving survivors behind. It’s time for Trump to wake up and do his job.”
Newsom knew that confronting Trump would probably doom any chance California had to get disaster aid. The White House even rebuffed Newsom’s request for a meeting with Trump or other high-ranking officials.
“The Trump Administration refused a routine wildfire recovery meeting — a rejection we’ve never seen before — even as LA families near a year without long-term federal financial help,” Newsom spokesperson Izzy Gardon said in a statement. “The message to survivors is unmistakable: Donald Trump doesn’t care about them.”
Newsom made a choice, and candidate Newsom prevailed over Governor Newsom. As 2026 unfolds, we will see many other conflicts between the two personages.  The candidate will probably continue to dominate.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/010725_Palisades-Fire_AP_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-09 08:56:12.068379

In S[...]","Technical assistance course participants at the networking event on June 27, 2025. (Photo courtesy UNR Extension)Federal funding for local food production was hit hard earlier this year when the Trump administration cut several agricultural programs supporting home-grown food and farm businesses. 
Despite those cuts, the University of Nevada, Reno says the local food systems built with Biden administration support before funding was stripped away are here to stay.
In September, the U.S. the Department of Agriculture (USDA) eliminated a $360 million Biden-era program that provided funding for 13 food business centers across the country to bolster rural development and build stronger food-supply networks in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The University of Nevada, Reno Extension lost $3 million in federal funding – which included direct grants to farmers and food businesses – when the program was cut three years ahead of schedule.
But the Southwest Regional Food Business Center – serving California, Arizona, Nevada and Utah – created foundational infrastructure that strengthened Nevada’s local food system during its two year run, and UNR is determined to build on it.
“It built a collaboration around four states and those partnerships don’t just go away because the money went away,” said Staci Emm, the Nevada state leader for the region’s food business center.
While Nevada lost more than half of the $5 million initially awarded through the local food program, the impacts of that funding have been significant, said Emm.
The Southwest Regional Food Business Center was able to help 170 Nevada businesses increase food production capacity and provided nearly $350,000 in direct grants to 18 farmers and food businesses in the state.
In Clark County alone 37 small and mid-sized food and farm businesses were provided technical assistance, including marketing, startup help, networking, and grant application support. Food businesses in the county were awarded more than $90,000 in capacity building funding.
Federal funding from the program reached every congressional district in Nevada, with the majority of capacity building funds – more than $212,000 – going to Congressional District 2, which covers nine counties in northern Nevada. 
About 80% of direct funds helped small and mid-sized food and farm businesses in Nevada pay for processing, packaging, and labeling equipment that will expand their reach and market for years to come. 
Another 30% of direct funding went to improving transportation systems in Nevada for home-grown produce and meats. 
Those impacts are expected to grow, said Becky DeForest, a grant writer for the food business center.
“We experienced some contracting delays from USDA and now more projects have been approved to move forward, so we hope to have more impacts to report in the next several months,” said Deforest.
Emm, the Nevada state leader for the region’s food business center, also works as a rancher and said one of the biggest impacts was the infrastructure funding for small meat processing businesses.
The Nevada Department of Agriculture, with the assistance of the Southwest Regional Food Business Center, established the first State Meat Inspection Program to reduce wait times and expand market access for local producers to reach local markets.
The program will help expand the number of in-state USDA inspected slaughter facilities, said Emm. Nevada only has four located in the state, all in the Northwestern region, forcing many producers to travel over 250 miles to process their animals. 
One of the big success stories of the Southwest Regional Food Business Center is CattleBros Steak and Seafood. 
Ryan Avila, founder of CattleBros Steak and Seafood, was able to scale his business with the help of the center by launching a marketing plan with website subscriptions, upgrade packaging, and streamline logistics. 
Avila found out about the center’s technical assistance program earlier this year and was one of 44 food business owners to participate in a 10-week virtual course hosted by the University of Nevada, Reno Extension through the Southwest Regional Food Business Center. 
After completing the technical assistance program Avila was awarded $10,000 in funding to capitalize on training the center provided. 
“These funds help level the playing field for small, independent businesses like ours,” Avila said.
UNR is now looking at different ways to restructure the center by emphasizing what worked best, including the technical assistance and direct grants to farmers and ranchers. 
In the two and a half months after the USDA cut funding Emm said her team worked around the clock to submit grant applications to cover the technical assistance funding UNR lost. 
“We probably won’t find out if we’re funded till 2026, but I’m very proud of my team, because we were able to submit grant (applications) for over $6 million to keep all of our programs going,” Emm said.
The center’s arrival on the scene was fortuitous for a state challenged by high food insecurity, vast geographic distribution, and fragmented infrastructure. Local farmers struggle to compete with large out-of-state producers, who offset long-distance transportation costs through economies of scale. Yet, having a local supply of produce is important for the state’s food security, and consumers and restaurants alike are seeking more fruits and vegetables produced locally.
“The center was an excellent start, and I think it showed us what works really well and what didn’t work,” Emm said. 
Emm said the importance of local producers became even clearer during the pandemic which exposed the fragility of regional food systems and left many Nevadans vulnerable to hunger. At its peak, nearly 30% of households in the state were food insecure, compared with 21% nationally, with underserved communities being hit hardest.
“I think if covid didn’t teach us anything else, it taught us that we need to have some type of support within our local food system,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/514154700_1177310677758761_4692464632320965730_n-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 08:56:12.068379

The Alabama Birth Equity initiative is led by the Yellowhammer Fund and joined by Margins: Women Helping Black Women, Oasis Women’s Health, and Alabama Birth Center. Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund, said the initiative will help midwives in Alabama pay for their training, which usually costs $4,000-8,000 per semester, and transportation to clinics.
“Acknowledging that the Alabama Birth Center has a lot going on outside of being a preceptor, and compensating them so that they can compensate their staff for those trainings,” Fountain said.

Fountain said the initiative’s goal is to have 10 midwives or doulas in Alabama within one year, and to meet any reproductive health needs.
“What we’re going to do is make some ground on midwifery policy. One of which being that midwives don’t count as guests when you’re at the hospital,” Fountain said. “The person that might not make the cut might be the person you really needed to make sure you have adequate care.” 
Alabama has long struggled with higher-than-average infant mortality rates.  According to ADPH, the state’s infant mortality rate were 7.1 babies per 1,000 live births that died within the first year of life in 2024. That was down from 7.8 deaths per 1,000 births in 2023, but still significantly higher than the national infant mortality rate of 5.5 deaths per 1,000 live births 
Infant mortality rates for Black Alabamians remain disproportionately high and racial disparities wide. According to the ADPH data, the infant mortality rate among white Alabamians was 5.4 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2024. For Black Alabamians, the rate was 11.8 per 1,000. In 2023, the rates were 5.7 and 13.1 deaths per 1,000 births, respectively. 
Dr. Yashica Robinson, an OB-GYN and founder of Alabama Birth Center in Huntsville, said that access to prenatal care in rural counties makes a major difference in infant mortality. 
“It doesn’t have to be a huge medical event,” Robinson said of giving birth. “It’s when we’re not properly prepared and properly educated, our moms aren’t healthy and they’re not getting prenatal care early enough. Then we miss the opportunities to intervene and make sure they get off to a good start.”
Part of the initiative also includes advocating for policy changes like funding for birth centers, Robinson and Fountain said. Robinson said a lack of support from the state for birth centers has also contributed to maternal and infant mortality rates.
She said that improving birth outcomes seems nonpartisan, but the path to fixing the problem is where partisan politics come in.
“It doesn’t matter what side you’re on, we want to see improved outcomes for both moms and babies,” Robinson said. “I think the problem ends up being lawmakers’ understanding of how we bring that change about.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/doctorpatient-2-1024x540-1.jpg,,,2025-12-09 08:56:12.068379

Gabby Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt when she was shot while meeting with constituents, released its annual Gun Law Scorecard on Monday.

“There is no denying that strong gun laws save lives. This year, Michigan scored a B- on GIFFORDS’ Annual Scorecard, and while we celebrate the lifesaving laws that earned that grade, we can’t stop here,” Giffords Executive Director Emma Brown said in a statement. “The work ahead is urgent.

What had been a felony — having two ounces of cannabis flower in a car, enough for about 100 joints — became legal overnight when the law took effect on Aug. 1.
But legalization hasn’t ended marijuana prosecutions. Minnesota prosecutors have brought more than 3,500 charges and won more than 1,200 misdemeanor convictions against people with cannabis in their cars since legalization, according to a Minnesota Reformer analysis. Additionally, prosecutors have filed nearly 500 charges against people for consuming cannabis in vehicles, either as passengers or drivers.
That’s due to an important but unadvertised caveat: all cannabis products — including flower, vape pens, wax and edibles — must be in the trunk (or trunk area in the case of SUVs) unless they’re sealed in their original, labeled packaging from a dispensary.
The police stops and prosecutions have defense lawyers concerned about the threat of racial profiling and warrantless vehicle searches.
“Now there’s this whole entry point to all of these cars — officers are going to take it every time they get,” Amanda Brodhag, a Hennepin County public defender, said.
Law enforcement leaders and prosecutors say there’s an obvious public safety rationale for the law: driving under the influence of cannabis or any intoxicating substance is dangerous and they shouldn’t be easily accessible to the driver.
The packaging law has caught many consumers and even cannabis attorneys unawares.
“I’m surprised,” said Elliot Ginsburg, an attorney who helps marijuana growers, manufacturers and retailers comply with the new regulatory regime. “I suspect a lot of people don’t know that.”
The law prohibiting improperly packaged marijuana in vehicles isn’t mentioned on the state’s “need to know” page about adult-use cannabis, nor is it referenced anywhere in the chapter of laws governing recreational cannabis, including the lengthy section detailing limits on cannabis possession and the many things people may not do with it, like use it in a vehicle.
The rules are found in the lengthy chapter of traffic laws, next to the nearly identical section on open alcohol containers.
Violating the cannabis open package law is a misdemeanor, carrying a maximum penalty of $1,000 fine and 90 days in jail, although many people end up paying a few hundred dollars or less, according to the Reformer’s review of convictions.
In dozens of convictions reviewed by the Reformer, some cases included evidence that the driver had recently consumed, like a burnt roach in the ashtray or a vape pen tucked under the driver’s leg. In those cases, there were often additional charges such as driving under the influence, speeding or driving without a license.
In many other cases, however, the driver is not even suspected of being under the influence but simply had a jar of marijuana in the passenger area or in the center console. In those cases, drivers often freely showed officers their bag of weed, seemingly unaware they had done anything wrong.
Brodhag, the Hennepin County public defender, said the people she’s represented charged with marijuana packaging violations have been surprised to learn they did anything wrong.
She and other criminal defense attorneys have also seen officers use it to search vehicles without a warrant or the driver’s consent, which they say is a troubling trend. They worry police may use the ban on improperly packaged cannabis as part of a strategy that targets people of color and people in low-income neighborhoods in hopes of turning up illegal guns, drugs or other contraband.
In 2023, the Minnesota Supreme Court ruled that the odor of marijuana alone did not give police officers enough probable cause to search a vehicle without a warrant or the owner’s consent. But if drivers admit to having marijuana in the passenger area or a police officer sees it, that could justify a warrantless search.
There are apparent racial disparities in some counties, according to data obtained by the Reformer through a public records request. In the state’s most populous Hennepin County, for instance, around 42% of people charged with having open cannabis packages or using in their vehicles were Black despite making up roughly 13% of the population. In Ramsey and Dakota counties, roughly a third of people charged since legalization were Black.
“We’re just switching how we’re criminalizing the same exact plant,” Brodhag said. “And it’s going to hit the same communities that the criminalization of marijuana did.”
Brodhag serves on the state’s Cannabis Expungement Board, which was created by the Legislature to review more than 100,000 past marijuana-related cases. Sen. Lindsey Port, DFL-Minneapolis, a lead author of the bill said the aim is to “undo that harm” of cannabis prohibition.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Brodhag finds it hard to reconcile her work on that board expunging low-level cannabis offenses with defending people who continue to be charged with the low-level cannabis offense of having an improperly sealed bag or vape pen in the car.
“These cases are not going to be up for expungement in the same way, and these people are going to have convictions that could still impact their future,” Brodhag said.
How often people are charged for improperly stored marijuana varies widely across the state. For instance, there were more charges brought in McLeod County, population 36,771, since legalization than Ramsey County, population 552,352 — 128 to 120.
Since misdemeanor charges are usually brought by city attorneys, charging rates can differ greatly across city lines. Prosecutors in Edina, population 53,494, have brought 93 charges since legalization compared to 87 brought in Minneapolis, population 429,954.
Ginsburg, the cannabis business attorney, says it doesn’t make sense to treat a resealed jar of marijuana in the glove compartment the same as an open beer can in the driver’s cupholder.
“If you have a can of beer open, it’s in the process of being consumed. But a broken seal on a package means you maybe used some two weeks ago,” Ginsburg said. “I don’t see why that should be a crime.”
A resealed jar of marijuana seems akin to a case of beer with a few cans missing, which is not a crime to have in the passenger area of a car in Minnesota. (At least, prosecutors and members of the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed it was not a crime in 2021 case.) Law enforcement leaders counter it’s also like having a half-full handle of vodka or bottle of wine, which is a crime.
Another important distinction is that virtually all beer, wine and other spirits that people have in their cars came sealed from a store, whereas the vast majority of cannabis, at least for now, is either purchased on the black market or grown at home. Until recently there were only a handful of dispensaries in Minnesota where people could buy cannabis in the required “child-resistant, tamper-evident and opaque” packages.
Ginsburg also pointed out that consumers could face misdemeanor charges if manufacturers don’t package their product according to strict state standards and they happen to have it in the passenger area of their cars.
“The vast, vast, vast majority are doing their best to comply… but during this awkward transition period, there is confusion in the market,” Ginsburg said.
McLeod County Attorney Ryan Hansch, whose office has brought 72 charges since legalization, said open cannabis package violations are hardly a priority for his office compared with more serious crimes. But when law enforcement brings him a case, his job is fairly straightforward.
“If the evidence supports criminal charges — absent some other considerations — it is typically going to be charged,” Hansch said.
Law enforcement officers have broad discretion over whether to refer charges, and Hansch said he’s confident officers are choosing to educate people about the law and let them go with a warning in a fair number of cases.
Edina Police Sgt. Mike Sussman said he isn’t surprised by his city’s relatively high charging rate and doesn’t think it’s a particularly enlightening statistic.
Edina has major highways crossing through their jurisdiction connecting Minneapolis to outer-ring suburbs. Plus, the Minneapolis Police Department is short hundreds of officers and likely busier answering 911 calls. (Minneapolis police are also barred from pulling people over for equipment violations like broken taillights and tinted windows following federal and state investigations that found they had a pattern of racial discrimination.)
“We are heavily traffic-focused,” Sussman said.
He said they’re not interested in “nitpicking” small amounts of cannabis, but they try to follow the letter of the law.
“The citation is what changes the driving behavior,” Sussman said. “And consistency is usually the key when it comes to some of these enforcements because otherwise you could be accused of favoritism.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-2214419003-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 07:56:27.557591

(Photo via Collins’ X account)Washington state mistakenly issued nearly 700 licenses to drive trucks and buses to noncitizens who don’t qualify over the past seven years. 
This issue has drawn heavy criticism from the Trump administration and others after a semitruck driver, Harjinder Singh, allegedly made an illegal U-turn and killed three people in Florida. Singh wrongfully received a standard commercial driver’s license from Washington state, the state Department of Licensing concluded. 
U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy has since threatened to withhold federal highway funding from states that issue these licenses to immigrants who don’t qualify. He has also tried to restrict who qualifies for commercial licenses, a move that is being litigated.
The growing attention led Washington’s licensing department to discover 685 other errors of the same kind over the course of seven years. All of those licenses were active when the mistakes were found. That figure doesn’t account for errors with credentials that had already lapsed. 
A U.S. Department of Transportation spokesperson said Washington’s “failure to follow federal law is a blatant breakdown in its responsibility to protect the public.”
“By handing out standard CDLs to drivers who were never eligible, Washington sent unsafe foreign drivers onto highways across America and put countless families in danger,” the spokesperson said in an email. “This is exactly the kind of negligence Secretary Duffy is working to eliminate. Following the law is not optional.”
Washington Department of Licensing spokesperson Nathan Olson said in an email that the “Errors have been addressed, and DOL is working to make changes in our system, process, procedures, and training to prevent mis-issuances in the future.” 
Singh and others should have received what is called a non-domiciled commercial driver’s license, meant for noncitizens with valid work authorization. Citizens and lawful permanent residents get standard licenses, which is what Singh received. 
Standard licenses expire at the same time as the driver’s regular driving credential, while non-domiciled ones lapse when their work authorization expires. It’s unclear how many of the 685 drivers in Washington were issued commercial licenses that went beyond their work authorization due to the mistake, Olson said. 
The state submitted its investigation into its mistakes to the federal government last month.
Before the Florida crash, Singh also wrongfully received a credential from California. Because of this, his Washington license was invalid at the time of the crash this year, Olson said.
Earlier this year, Duffy launched a nationwide audit of the states that issue these non-domiciled licenses to immigrants. President Donald Trump also signed an executive order that says truckers without English proficiency should be kept off the roads.
Duffy has pushed new rules limiting the types of visas that allow noncitizens to qualify for trucking licenses. Only those with H-2A, H-2B or E-2 visas would be allowed to get credentials. These visas make up just 10,000 of the 200,000 noncitizen license holders. 
King County, where Seattle is located, asked a Washington, D.C., appeals court to review the policy shift, noting it would cost the county’s bus fleet some drivers. In response, the court last month temporarily halted these restrictions. 
Also last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, announced the state was revoking 17,000 commercial driver’s licenses issued to immigrants because the licenses had expiration dates later than the drivers were allowed to remain in the country.
In Washington, the 685 license holders at issue have been given a chance to update their legal status if, for example, they’ve since received their green cards. It’s unclear how many credentials the state has revoked.

The state licensing department has stopped processing all non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses and learner permits.
Last week, Duffy said one-third of non-domiciled commercial driver’s licenses issued in Minnesota were illegal. He gave Minnesota an ultimatum: Get in compliance within 30 days or risk losing $30 million in federal highway funding. In November, Duffy threatened nearly $75 million earmarked for Pennsylvania for similar problems.
Washington faces ire from another direction. After the fatal crash in August, Florida’s attorney general moved to sue Washington and California at the U.S. Supreme Court, seeking a permanent ban on both states issuing commercial driver’s licenses to noncitizens. Washington has until Jan. 27 to respond to Florida’s filing.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/harjinder-singh-1024x576.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 07:56:27.557591

Most parents I know feel the same way.
Among the thousands of bills pre-filed for the next legislative session, Missouri lawmakers are targeting some of the ugliest corners of digital life: rules on AI chatbots, penalties for distributing intimate images and — getting the most attention — age-verification for accessing online pornography.
Missouri recently began enforcing age checks for sites when at least a third of the content is pornographic. Attorney General Catherine Hanaway has promised vigorous enforcement, but legislators want to codify the rule into law to defend it against legal challenges.
The case for these laws isn’t hard to grasp. Age verification seems to offer something simple and enforceable: a line between adult content and kids, and a requirement that platforms respect it. In theory, it creates parity between the expectations we already place on brick-and-mortar adult businesses.
But I’m not convinced it will accomplish what supporters hope, at least not without serious drawbacks.
First, the technological reality is messy. Determined minors can bypass age checks with VPNs, mirror sites or offshore platforms that have no reason to comply with Missouri law. Pretending otherwise underestimates the way the internet actually works.
Platforms that do comply, like Pornhub, have simply blocked access entirely — while less reputable, unregulated sites remain. That risks pushing kids not toward safety, but toward predators.
Second, every age-verification system comes with privacy tradeoffs. Whether a site uses an ID check, a third-party age-token service or biometric estimation, records are created — maybe minimal, maybe encrypted, but never risk-free. No database is breach-proof, and concentrating sensitive data creates an enticing target for hackers.
Third, we should take seriously what it means to normalize government-mandated identity checks for accessing legal content. The intention may be narrow, but the mechanism is broad: a state-enforced requirement to prove who you are before viewing lawful speech.
Even if courts set limits, creating the infrastructure makes future expansion easier to other categories of information a government may deem objectionable.
Finally, there’s the hard truth that no digital gate will solve what is ultimately a behavioral and educational problem. Kids don’t seek explicit content only because it’s available. They seek it because no one has helped them understand what healthy boundaries, consent and sexuality look like in a digital world.
Age-verification laws may be part of a response, but they are not close to a full one.
There’s no perfect answer to this challenge. But we can start by investing in better digital literacy education for both kids and parents. Like it or not, our kids are digital natives. We must teach them how to live safely online.
At the same time, public officials can push tech companies to build platforms that default to safety and make shielding kids from harmful content a priority instead of an afterthought.
Wanting to protect children online is the most reasonable instinct in the world. But we shouldn’t trade privacy and free expression for a system that, in practice, may block the biggest players while leaving a maze of dangerous alternatives wide open.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)A panel of New Jersey lawmakers advanced legislation Monday that would give state health officials — instead of the feds — the final word on immunization schedules and recommendations in the Garden State.
Legislators were driven to act after a Centers for Disease Control committee on Friday reversed its decades-long recommendation that all newborns get hepatitis B vaccines at birth to protect Americans from the incurable liver disease, said Sen. Joseph Vitale (D-Middlesex), the legislation’s prime sponsor and chair of the Senate’s health committee.
“We here in New Jersey have the opportunity and obligation to protect our families,” Vitale said.

Lawmakers merged the bill with another that would require insurers to cover, with no copay, the cost of vaccines the state Department of Health recommends. Supporters say the move is intended to eliminate any confusion among the public, physicians, and insurers that has resulted from the CDC’s changing recommendations and put health guidance from New Jersey’s health officials “at the forefront,” Vitale said.
His committee advanced the bill along party lines, after almost two hours of testimony in a packed Statehouse committee room that pitted doctors and other health professionals who support the bill against anti-vaccine advocates.
The physicians testified that vaccines save lives and are endorsed by all major medical associations.
The decision by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to reverse its hepatitis B vaccine “caused great alarm throughout the medical community,” Dr. Jennifer H. Chuang told lawmakers.
The vaccine helped reduce the annual hepatitis B infection rate for infants and children from 16,000 cases when the vaccine was first recommended in 1991 to less than 20 now, said Chuang, a pediatrician, medical educator, and director of the residency program at St. Joseph’s Children’s Hospital in Paterson.
Chuang ticked off a grisly list of what people with liver disease endure, including abdominal pain, encephalopathy, and “bleeding from everywhere” because blood loses its ability to clot.
“Liver failure is a horrible disease. It strips one of dignity, and it is a horrible death. I cannot bear the thought of a young, innocent child needlessly carrying the burden of this awful disease,” Chuang said.
Anti-vaccine advocates accused the legislation’s supporters of playing politics and predicted state vaccine recommendations would become mandatory. They pointed to New Jersey’s nursing home deaths during the COVID-19 pandemic as a reason why they do not trust state health officials.
Alexandra Bougher, who heads a Bergen County Moms for Liberty chapter, warned that state vaccine recommendations would become “a standard families are expected to follow.”
“We cannot accept a system where one department can expand vaccine guidance or alter requirements without public debate, without scientific consensus, and without any built-in oversight. This is not good public health. This is unchecked power,” Bougher said, adding, “Parents deserve stability, not surprise mandates. They deserve informed consent, not forced compliance through bureaucratic shortcuts.”
Jeff Brown, New Jersey’s acting health commissioner, and his deputy, Novneet Sahu, who oversees public health services, said federal health officials are the ones changing vaccine guidance without scientific consensus or oversight.

Brown signed a directive Friday saying his department continues to recommend that all newborns receive a dose of the hepatitis B vaccine.
He told lawmakers Monday that the CDC’s immunization advisory committee had made “a departure from considering science and evidence and a movement towards, frankly, embracing pseudoscience.”
Sahu echoed that concern.
“We’re at a very critical moment in public health. Lies, pseudoscience, the spread of misinformation are major threats in our ability to protect the public’s health,” Sahu said. “When federal leaders fail and misinformation spreads, state policies must empower New Jerseyans.”
The committee’s three Republicans voted against the bill, with Sen. Holly Schepisi (R-Bergen) voicing concerns about state health guidance becoming mandatory as it did during the pandemic.
“We all just came out of the pandemic. Our governor has the strongest executive power in the nation. And during that period of time, there were mandates on vaccines. We saw nurses, police, prison guards, school teachers get fired, told they couldn’t go. Our own colleagues were threatened that they may not be able to come and do their job if they didn’t receive vaccines and show their vaccine cards,” Schepisi said. “I’m a no.”
The committee’s Democrats supported the legislation. Sen. John McKeon (D-Essex) told critics the bill is needed because federal health officials have abandoned “mainstream science.”
“I can go through the graveyards, before several vaccines were ever put into place, and look at the children that died, going back in the ’50s and early ‘60s,” McKeon said, prompting critics to grumble loudly in complaint.
He responded: “Well, those are facts. You know, facts are stubborn things.”
Monday was the legislation’s first hearing. Lawmakers have a narrow window to get it to Gov. Phil Murphy’s desk, because the current legislative session ends in mid-January.

Without the stewardship fund, projects to conserve 1,300 acres of Northwoods forest near the headwaters of the Wisconsin River in Vilas County, hundreds of acres of “ecologically significant” wetlands in Door County and dozens of acres of prairie and grassland in Dane County could go unfinished. 
“It’s a bit bleak and it’s so disheartening to know that there’s so many beautiful, wonderful places kind of on the chopping block right now all across the state,” says Emily Wood, executive director of the Door County Land Trust. “It’s not just us. We hear from our partners that there are hundreds and thousands of acres that are just not going to be protected if [the program] goes away, and that’s going to have such an impact, domino effect, on future generations.” 
The Knowles-Nelson Stewardship fund was created in 1989 to fund land conservation in Wisconsin. The program provides grants to local governments and non-profits to cover some of the costs for purchasing and conserving land that can be used for recreation, preserving animal habitats and supporting local industries such as forestry. 
The program enjoys massive bipartisan support, yet in recent years, some Republicans in the state Legislature — largely from communities in the northern part of the state — have grown hostile to it, claiming that the program has too often been used to fund the purchase of land up north, depleting local tax bases. 
Republican legislators have also complained that they no longer have oversight over the Department of Natural Resource’s management of the program after a Wisconsin Supreme Court decision last year found that the Legislature had given itself an unconstitutional veto authority over the DNR’s grant decisions. 
Several attempts have been made to save the program from expiring next summer. In his initial state budget proposal, Gov. Tony Evers asked to extend the program for ten years with $100 million in annual funding. Republicans stripped that provision from the budget immediately. 
Rep. Tony Kurtz (R-Wonewoc) and Sen. Patrick Testin (R-Stevens Point) have authored a bill that would extend the program for four years at $28 million per year. The bill also includes a provision that would require the full Legislature to approve any land purchases that cost more than $1 million — a proposal that critics say would be far too slow for the speed at which real estate transactions need to move. 
A separate proposal from Sen. Jodi Habush Sinykin (D-Whitefish Bay) would re-authorize the program for six years at $72 million per year and create an independent board made up of members appointed by the Legislature to approve large land purchases through the program. 
But there has been little progress made on advancing either proposal and now conservation groups are trying to plan for the next year without the support that Knowles-Nelson has traditionally provided.

Wood says that her organization is trying to protect the landscape in one of the most ecologically significant parts of the state. The challenge for her group is that Door County’s natural beauty draws tourists and increased development, yet too much development would damage the natural beauty. 
The Door County Land Trust has protected more than 5,000 acres of land in the county and Knowles-Nelson has covered half the cost in nearly every transaction, according to Wood. With the program shuttering next year, three projects totaling about $1 million — all of which scored highly on the DNR criteria — are at risk. 
“The county as a whole receives a ton of money from the Knowles-Nelson stewardship fund, because we are so geared towards tourism and access to natural resources,” she says.  The stewardship fund is critical for Door County to continue “to be the county that you know, everyone expects us to be when they get in the car and come up here.” 
Near the southern border of Dane County, Filip Sanna and the BadgerLand Foundation are working with the Driftless Area Land Conservancy and The Prairie Enthusiasts to protect and restore vital oak savannah and prairie in southern Wisconsin. 
Hundreds of years of agriculture have all but destroyed the native prairies in what was once one of the most ecologically diverse regions in the world.
The foundation has already conserved and gifted to the Driftless Area Land Conservancy hundreds of acres between Belleville and New Glarus that will soon be open to the public for hiking and hunting and used for sustainable practices such as regenerative agriculture. But future plans are threatened by the looming loss of stewardship funds. 
Recently, a tract of about 30 acres became available on the market within an area environmental groups have targeted as important for protecting grassland bird habitat. The Prairie Enthusiasts wanted to conserve the land but funds through the stewardship program wouldn’t be available fast enough. So the BadgerLand Foundation and the Prairie Enthusiasts reached an agreement in which the foundation would purchase the land and then sell it to the Prairie Enthusiasts once the stewardship grant comes through. 
Now those funds are uncertain and Sanna says it could sidetrack future plans.
One of the arguments Republican legislators have often made against the Knowles-Nelson program is that more populated areas in the southern part of the state should bear more of the land conservation burden. 
But the program dying off could jeopardize land conservation in the population centers because land is more expensive there. Dane County’s recently enacted 2026 budget doubled the size of the county’s conservation fund from $5 million to $10 million. That, Sanna says, can be a Band-aid for now. But county and local governments are facing their own budget challenges and smaller counties won’t be able to step into the DNR’s conservation shoes. In many places, the local governments are also dependent on stewardship program funds to conserve and maintain public land. 
“One of the responses we have to the uncertainty about Knowles-Nelson is to try to look to the county level and then some combination of county funding and private donations,” Sanna says. “That might work in Dane County, where we have a relatively strong tax base. But if you go to the neighboring counties around, Green and Iowa and Lafayette and all of those counties, that’s probably not an option.” 
“if [Knowles-Nelson] dies, the next step is going to be, now you’re going to have nice parks around all the wealthy people, but all the rest of Wisconsin that is smaller population centers that’ll just be like towns, rural housing, farmland, private land,” he continues. “There won’t be public land.” 
Way up in Vilas County, in the part of the state where the fight over land conservation has been most heated, a handful of administrative delays might end up killing a 1,300 acre conservation project because stewardship funds will no longer be available. 
The Northwoods Alliance and Partners in Forestry are working together to use federal and Knowles-Nelson funds to preserve two tracts of land west of the town of Land O’ Lakes. Joe Hovel, director of Partners in Forestry, says the project would include trails as part of the extensive Wilderness Lakes bike path system. 
Because the real estate deal on the project got delayed, and the slow speed at which the state and federal government have moved, it’s likely that the chance to use Knowles-Nelson dollars has already passed. 
Hovel says the complaints about land conservation up north discount the economic value of protecting the land for recreational uses. 
“It’s really short sighted in a sense that there isn’t enough respect for the recreational value of this land conservation stuff,” Hovel says. “The value of public access conservation land dwarfs, I mean it literally dwarfs, the value that timber revenue brings in.” 
A report from the Outdoor Recreation Roundtable found that recreation on federal public lands generates $128.5 billion in economic activity every year. All the logging on federal land generates $200-300 million per year.

The Legislature has just over six months to extend the program. Wood says it would be a self-inflicted wound if elected officials allow a program that other states look to as a model to expire. 
“It’s so disheartening to hear that the fund that has had so much success over the years, that other states look to how to fund conservation, they look to Wisconsin’s model on how to do it, and that we as a state, that same model is going to go down just because of partisan gridlock,” she says. “We really just need to keep it alive because funding it in a later year, or coming back and making changes to make it better are way more possible if it’s an existing program.” 
“But coming up with another one from scratch, it just seems like it would be an impossibility. So right now, it does feel like we are just screaming to keep it, just keep it alive.

DemasThe Michigan Department of Corrections has established a new policy to provide all confidential and legal mail sent to incarcerated individuals as photocopies in an attempt to stop drug smuggling, the department announced on Monday.
The policy is intended to stop incidents where drugs and contraband are smuggled to incarcerated people through tainted paper, envelopes, stickers or other means. 
“Illicit drugs have fundamentally changed over recent years to include synthetic sprays and strips which are easily added to paper and concealed in mail,” said Department of Corrections Director Heidi E. Washington in a release from the department. “These drugs pose a great risk to our staff and those living in our facilities; this is a commonsense policy that will reduce the chance of sickness and death by those who come in contact with these substances.”
A similar policy making it so all standard mail was photocopied was put into place in 2020, but up to now, legal and confidential mail — generally used by attorneys and legal organizations — was not included in that policy.

Last year, the Department of Corrections began using an online registration system for attorneys to send legal mail, known as TextBehind, where each piece of mail would have a unique QR code indicating that it was actually coming from an attorney.
Under the prior policies, the Michigan Bar Association wrote, “MDOC cannot open an inmate’s legal mail and must provide inmates with originals.” This update changes that, and correctional officers will open all mail and create a photocopy in front of the intended recipient before shredding the original. 
Legal mail, which has more protections than standard mail, will continue to meet confidentiality requirements, the Department of Corrections said. 
According to the ACLU, “Officials may open incoming privileged mail to check it for contraband, but must do so in your presence. They are not allowed to open outgoing privileged mail. Privileged mail ordinarily cannot be read unless prison officials obtain a warrant allowing them to do so.”
The new policy will go into effect on Jan. 5, 2026.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/IMG_2381-768x1024.jpg,,,2025-12-09 06:57:27.290444

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A judge’s order blocking the Indiana Department of Health from releasing the reports that doctors file about individual abortions will remain in place under a state Court of Appeals decision.
A panel of three appeals court judges agreed unanimously with a Marion County judge that the records — known as terminated pregnancy reports — should be protected as confidential medical records.
Dr. Caitlin Bernard and Dr. Caroline Rouse, both Indianapolis OB-GYNs, sued in February to block release of the documents after the state healthy agency entered into a settlement agreement with South Bend-based Voices for Life. That agreement came out of the anti-abortion organization’s 2024 lawsuit against the Health Department, filed when the agency stopped releasing the individual reports but reversed itself after Gov. Mike Braun took office this year.
The decision written by Judge Mark Bailey cited the reprimand Bernard received in 2023 from the state Medical Licensing Board for publicly discussing the abortion she provided for a 10-year-old rape victim. 
Bernard’s statements then shared some of the same information, such as age, state of residence, gestational age and approximate date of treatment, that would be available from the terminated pregnancy reports.
“Defendants contend that TPRs are not patient medical records because they do not include the patient’s name,” the decision released Friday said of the Health Department. “But the absence of a patient’s name from a TPR does not make it something other than a patient medical record, just as the absence of a driver’s name from a Bureau of Motor Vehicles driving record does not make it something other than a driving record.”
Marion County judge blocks release of abortion records

Bernard and Rouse said in a statement released by their lawyers that they welcomed the court’s decision and its affirmation of our patients’ right to privacy.”
“Doctors cannot provide safe, ethical care when patients’ personal health information is at risk of being exposed,” their statement said. “This decision strengthens the safeguards that allow us to continue to provide evidence-based reproductive healthcare. We will continue to stand against any state or federal attempts to undermine the rights of patients and the doctors who care for them.” 
The state attorney general’s office, which is representing the Health Department in the case, did not immediately reply Monday to a request seeking comment.
The decision could be appealed to the Indiana Supreme Court.
The reports — redacted to protect patients — were released for years. Anti-abortion groups have filed complaints with the attorney general’s office based on the abortion reports, including if a doctor filed a report late. But the Health Department stopped releasing them after a near-total abortion ban meant far fewer abortions. They feared a woman could be identified, and instead released aggregate data released in quarterly reports. Those do not include the names of the doctors or dates of procedure.
Voices for Life argued that it was seeking the reports in order to monitor whether doctors were abiding by the state’s near-total abortion ban that was enacted in 2022.

(Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)Immigration and Customs Enforcement has become the nation’s most expensive embarrassment — a bloated ($45 billion) bureaucracy that tears families apart, squanders millions, and undermines real law enforcement, all while pretending it’s “keeping us safe.” Spoiler alert: As everyone is witnessing in real time on the streets of Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis, and New Orleans, it isn’t. Washington won’t fix this. If justice is coming, it will have to be delivered by people who actually care about our communities, not politicians polishing their egos.
  ICE’s Dangerous Overreach 

Let’s get real. ICE isn’t hunting violent criminals. Less than one percent of its arrests involve rape, kidnapping, or homicide. The rest? Students, children, farmworkers, parents, veterans’ family members — basically anyone inconvenient enough to get in the way of headline-grabbing deportations. This is political theater, neither law enforcement nor justice.
This isn’t “law and order.” It’s cruelty with a badge. Meanwhile, the truly dangerous — drug lords, human traffickers, organized criminals,— keep doing their thing while ICE plays detention bingo. If there were a trophy for the most misdirected law enforcement agency, ICE would win by a landslide.
  A Culture of Corruption 

Inside ICE, misconduct is practically a perk. Officers have been arrested for assault, sexual assault, and child pornography. Senior officials? Accused of bribery and cover-ups. And yet Washington showers them with billions of taxpayer dollars, as if bad behavior deserves a bonus.
Imagine a local police department with that record. Would we put up with it for a second? Of course not. But ICE hides behind federal power, while politicians look away and mutter prayers for “law and order.” They call this oversight. In reality, it is a daily denial of justice.  It’s fascism with gusto.
  Detention for Profit 

Before 1983, the U.S. detained about 35 immigrants a year. Today, ICE plans to cage 107,000 at a cost of $15 billion. Ninety percent of these beds are run by private prison companies like GEO Group and CoreCivic, whose lucrative business model ($1.5 billion in revenue) depends on no-bid contracts keeping cells full.
Most detainees — more than 70 percent — have no criminal record. But who cares when misery is profitable? America has become the land of the fee, where suffering is commodified and corporate boards cheer.
  What States and Cities Can Do 

Here’s the kicker: We don’t have to wait for Congress to grow a spine. Local and state governments have the power — and the moral duty — to act:


Prosecute ICE misconduct. Assault, kidnapping, false imprisonment? Charge them like the New York Attorney General and San Francisco District Attorney promise to do. No badge should be a free pass.


Restrict operations.  Ban masked agents like California, limit guns near schools, hospitals, and churches, and outlaw the feds from buying warrantless cell phone data.  In March 2025, Trump directed Palantir to provide its data profiles on all Americans to federal agencies.  In May, Montana banned its state law enforcement from buying this data.  Every state should ban the feds from having our data, too.


Use zoning and taxes. Regulate leases with ICE like Portland. Pass new “nuisance” ordinances to bar the use of tear gas and bar the congregation of any groups in excess of three people in masks. Deny permits for detention centers, hit landlords who lease to ICE with steep fines, and use the funds for legal defense for detainees.


Cut off the profit. End contracts with private prisons. Divest public funds from companies profiting from human misery.


  What We Must Do 

Every level of government has a role. Every citizen has a responsibility. Demand action from your attorney general, county attorney, and city council. Push your representatives to slash ICE’s budget and inspect detention centers without warning.
And if local leaders shrug? Remind them that silence isn’t neutrality — it’s complicity. ICE isn’t just violating laws; it’s trampling on morality, decency, and basic human dignity.
The tools exist. The moral imperative is obvious. The only question: Do we have the guts to use them?
Because when Washington hides under its desk, it falls to us to stand up. And if ICE won’t melt from shame, we’ll just turn up the heat — preferably to a level that makes everyone in the bureaucracy sweat.
After all, ICE may be full of hot air, but our communities have the fire.

(Juan Salinas II/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Democratic candidate in eastern Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District brought in a six-figure fundraising haul in the first 30 days of the campaign, Chris Backemeyer’s campaign announced Tuesday.
The $120,000 haul is $8,547 less than former State Sen. Carol Blood of Bellevue raised for her 2024 bid against incumbent Republican U.S. Rep. Mike Flood. Blood raised $29,203 in her first fundraising quarter during that race.

The former U.S. State Department diplomat, who now lives in Lincoln, entered the race last month. He is in a Democratic primary with Lincoln resident and renewable energy advocate Eric Moyer. The winner likely faces Flood in November. Flood hasn’t drawn a GOP challenger. 
“Nebraskans are ready for new leadership, and this early response shows we have the team, the momentum, and the pathway to flip this seat,” Backemeyer said in a statement. 
The 1st District comprises 12 Nebraska counties, including heavily Democratic Lincoln in Lancaster County, the votes of which are often overcome by the region’s more conservative rural areas. 
Flood has won his past two elections by 20 and roughly 16 percentage points, in a seat considered safely Republican by the nonpartisan Center for Politics, The Cook Political Report and Inside Elections.

Moyer told the Examiner that people “should be skeptical of any unofficial ‘boasts’ about fundraising.” Moyer said his campaign “is completely funded by small donations and zero PAC money,” which allows him “to be a truly independent voice for the people of Nebraska.” 
“Money doesn’t vote,” Moyer said. “People do.”
Both Moyer and Flood declined to show their current fundraising numbers as fundraising reports are still being finalized with the Federal Election Commission. The next FEC deadline is the end of the first month of 2026. 
According to the latest federal campaign finance reports filed last month, Moyer raised $5,496 and had $3,848 in cash on hand. Flood’s last filings listed  $1 million cash on hand, according to his campaign finance reports. The most recent reports have not yet been filed. 
Daniel Bass, a spokesperson for the Flood campaign, said Backemeyer’s “neighbors in Washington are funding his run for Congress because they know he will fight for D.C. values: high crime, high taxes and out-of-touch leadership.”
The primary election is on May 12.

(Photo by Baylor Spears/Wisconsin Examiner)Even with a crowded Democratic primary field, gubernatorial hopeful Mandela Barnes told reporters Monday that he is focusing his efforts on the Republican candidate he might face in November 2026 and he has raised a “strong haul” in the first week of his campaign.
Barnes, a former lieutenant governor and U.S. Senate candidate, visited Black Saddle Bike Shop (where he said he’s often had his bike serviced) on the North Side of Madison. The stop was part of Barnes’ “Wisconsin Way” tour, launched last week after he announced his campaign. He has joined a field of candidates in the Democratic primary that includes Lt. Gov. Sara Rodriguez, Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, Wisconsin Economic Development Corporation Missy Hughes, state Sen. Kelda Roys (D-Madison), state Rep. Francesca Hong (D-Madison) and former state Rep. Brett Hulsey.
Barnes said his fundraising so far is “something that’ll make my mom proud,” though he wouldn’t expand on how much money he has raised. He said his goal will be to raise $50 million in the race overall, though he also criticized the need to raise so much. 
Barnes noted that during Gov. Tony Evers’ successful second bid for the office, Evers spent around $42 million to defeat Republican businessman Tim Michels, who spent $28.48 million. A record-breaking $164 million was spent in 2022 on Wisconsin’s gubernatorial race.
“It’s not a good sign for things. I wish that were not the case. The goal is to get big money out of politics. The goal is for campaign and ethics reform,” Barnes said, adding that reform is needed at both  the state and federal levels. “We should be taking more steps to reduce the impact of money in politics,” he said.
Barnes said the first week of the campaign has been exciting, and he has been trying to talk to as many people as possible. He spoke with bike shop owner Mitch Pilon about rising costs under President Donald Trump and the effects of tariffs. 
“With an absence of support from the federal government, even if the state doesn’t have all the resources to make it better, at least staving off some of the worst from happening, I fully believe that’s a responsibility of state government,” he told Pilon, adding that he wants to help “tip the scales back into the favor of working people.” 
Pilon, who opened the shop in February 2020, said making ends meet has been a challenge for him and his partner, who is a social worker.
“In Wisconsin, after 10 years, your student loans should be absolved, which they’re not going to be now, and she has a master’s degree… that’s $100,000 in debt at social worker’s compensation,” Pilon said. The Trump administration has sought to upend student loan forgiveness programs this year. “I own a small business. I work really hard… we can’t afford a house.” 
“[Trump] promised to lower costs for people,” Barnes told reporters after the conversation. “He said he was going to bring back manufacturing to this country, specifically to this state. It hasn’t happened. As people continue to feel the pinch, tough decisions are being made.” 
Barnes said he got into the race because of the urgency of those sorts of challenges. 
“It’s a critical moment that calls for leadership. It calls for boldness, to not just take on the president, but to also offer real solutions for the problems that people are facing,” Barnes said. “So this is one of many small businesses that we’ll be showing up to… over the course of this campaign.” 
Pilon also asked Barnes about one of the obstacles that his campaign will need to overcome — his failed challenge to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson in 2022. Barnes has faced pushback to his campaign due to that loss. 
“We lost the Senate race…” Pilon said. “How do you get over that? How do you rise above that?”
Barnes responded that he didn’t get into the race for “personal reasons.”
“I got into it because there was work that needed to be done,” Barnes said. “I don’t feel like the job is being done and, alright, that’s a wakeup call to go out there and raise my hand and do the job.” 
“How do you change people’s minds?” Pilon asked. 
“A lot of it is personal stories and experience,” Barnes said. 
It has been rare for candidates in Wisconsin to succeed in winning a statewide race after an earlier loss. Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School poll, found in an analysis of previous governor and U.S. Senate election results that the last time a candidate won one of those statewide campaigns after losing a previous one was in the 1970s. Examples of failed second chances include Tom Barrett, who lost bids for governor in 2010 and 2012, Tim Michels, who lost to Evers in 2022 after he lost a bid for the Senate in 2004, and Russ Feingold, who lost Senate races in 2010 and 2016.
Barnes is undeterred by the precedent. 
“There’s a lot of history that would suggest I wouldn’t ever become lieutenant governor,” Barnes said in answer to a question about Franklin’s second-change analysis. “There’s also, you know, in terms of historical precedent, I don’t know that there is a precedent that suggests anybody on the Democratic or Republican side has a better chance of winning.”
Barnes ran for the Democratic lieutenant governor nomination in 2018 in a two-person race, going on to win on the same ticket as Gov. Tony Evers. He was elected and served as the state’s youngest and first Black lieutenant governor from 2019 to 2023. 
Wisconsin’s gubernatorial race next year is wide open for the first time since 2010.
During the 2022 Senate race, Barnes became the Democratic nominee after other high-profile candidates dropped out weeks before the primary.
Barnes denied he helped push the other Democrats out of the race then. He also said primaries are good for democracy when asked whether he wants other candidates to coalesce around him.
“I think it should be a battle of ideas, whether it’s a large primary or not, but would never that’s never been my style to try to get anybody out of any race,” Barnes said. “As you know, from the way I got in, I showed up by challenging someone in a primary election, so it’d be very hypocritical of me to suggest anybody get out.”
Barnes previously served in the Wisconsin State Assembly for two terms from 2013 to 2017. He gave up his seat in the state Assembly in 2016 to challenge former State Sen. Lena Taylor (D-Milwaukee). He lost the primary by more than 11,000 votes.
Barnes said his campaign will be focused not just on unifying Democrats but on a “unifying message to defeat extremists and extremism.” 
“It does not matter what your favorite ideology might be, there’s a place for you in this campaign because it is about improving quality of life for everybody,” Barnes said. 
With about 10 months until the primary, Barnes said he’ll be focused on the Republican candidates in the race. U.S. Rep. Tom Tiffany is the presumed frontrunner for the Republican nomination. 
“This is about pointing out flaws and failures, and Tom Tiffany as he stands as the front runner, his failures and leadership, his decisions to go lock-step with the president who has made things worse for Wisconsin,” Barnes said. “Tom Tiffany didn’t go to Washington to make things better for us, and we shouldn’t expect him to improve things for us as governor.” 
The primary election is scheduled for Aug. 11, 2026.

(Getty Images)Indiana officials on Thursday announced a nearly $75 million public–private investment aimed at strengthening literacy, STEM education, summer learning and career pathways for Hoosier students.
The effort includes $40 million from Lilly Endowment Inc. and $35 million in state funding. Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner described the initiative as one of the largest combined education commitments in state history.
“This funding will yield tremendous value for Hoosier students, educators, and families,” Jenner said in the announcement. “By aligning public dollars with funds from Lilly Endowment, we are better able to scale what works, address persistent challenges, and build the statewide infrastructure our students deserve. This funding will help our efforts to ensure that every child — no matter their ZIP code — has access to the high-quality learning opportunities that set them up for future success.”
Much of the investment targets literacy. Ten million dollars from the Lilly Endowment will expand the state’s K-5 Literacy Cadre, a program state officials credit, in part, with helping drive recent improvements in third-grade I-READ scores.
Indiana sees historic jump in third grade reading scores; retention data still pending

The new funding will support staffing for the Indiana Department of Education’s Literacy Center; recruitment and training of instructional coaches; statewide professional development; and research and evaluation. The Lilly Endowment previously provided a $60 million grant for similar literacy work in 2022.
Another $5 million will go toward adolescent literacy through “outcomes-based contracting,” allowing schools to partner with vendors that specialize in evidence-based reading interventions for grades 6–8.
The plan also includes $1 million for a statewide STEM “Landscape Analysis” to assess strengths and gaps in STEM education and develop recommendations to improve Indiana’s workforce pipeline, as well as $500,000 for a career-advising study to evaluate existing practices and design updated tools to help students explore career options.
Summer Learning Labs, a statewide network focused on academic recovery and enrichment, will receive $15 million to expand regional coordination, professional development, data systems and other supports during the next two years. Indiana Learns, the state’s microgrant program for individualized tutoring and enrichment in reading and math, will additionally receive $5 million in continued support.
Another $2 million will sustain INSPIRE, Indiana’s free statewide digital library, and a separate $1.5 million will strengthen IDOE’s capacity to implement these initiatives.
Indiana’s $35 million match comes from the Freedom and Opportunity Fund — a $50 million-per-year education fund created by the Indiana Legislature earlier this year to support literacy, tutoring, STEM and other high-priority student initiatives.
The state portion includes $10 million for elementary literacy; $1.5 million for adolescent literacy; $14.5 million for Summer Learning Labs; and $9 million for Indiana Learns.
“Lilly Endowment is especially pleased to help build on the momentum of efforts to enhance reading instruction in Indiana … ,” said N. Clay Robbins, the foundation’s chairman and CEO. “We are encouraged by the state’s commitment to improving STEM education and career advising and expanding effective year-round tutoring programs to improve student learning in reading and math.”

,WyoFile,2025-12-09 11:23:00+00:00,WyoFile,"Forest Service looks to public land, local tax dollars to house its workers","By Dante Filpula Ankney, KHOL 89.1 FM in collaboration with WyoFile",,,,,https://wyofile.com/forest-service-looks-to-public-land-local-tax-dollars-to-house-its-workers/,"

Proponents see Bridger-Teton National Forest project as a novel approach to keep vital forest workers close to the lands they manage. Critics see a “slippery slope.”
The post Forest Service looks to public land, local tax dollars to house its workers appeared first on WyoFile .","The Bridger-Teton National Forest has had so much trouble housing workers that it once considered moving its headquarters out of Jackson to escape the tight, high-priced real estate market. 
Now, the Forest Service is partnering with a nonprofit to build affordable rentals on 3.15 acres owned by the forest, an approach supporters say could serve as a national model for how to house federal workers on the lands they manage.
“I think the sense of urgency right now is greater than it’s ever been,” said Chad Hudson, supervisor of the Bridger-Teton National Forest.
While many embrace the concept as a way to keep vital workers in the valley with roughly half-priced rent, some worry it opens the door to privatizing cherished public lands. 
“The slippery slope of using federally protected wildland to expand the urban boundary of Jackson in order to subsidize housing that includes private sector employees is frankly terrifying for the future of Jackson Hole,” said Judd Grossman, a neighbor to the project, former Jackson Town Council candidate and self-described “no-growth libertarian.”
Grossman shared his concerns with a full room at the Jackson Town Council’s Nov. 30 meeting. But his resistance stood in stark contrast to the council, whose members signaled support for investing a little over $4 million of sales tax funds, earmarked for housing, in exchange for the right to rent six of 36 proposed units to town employees. Teton County has the same offer but has yet to consider the project, which sits next to existing Forest Service housing, the National Elk Refuge and a popular trailhead on the eastern edge of Jackson.
The Jackson Hole Community Housing Trust touts the project as a first of its kind in the nation and much-needed. Of more than 1,500 people on the affordable housing nonprofit’s waitlist, 114 are town or county employees.
Housing Trust Director Anne Cresswell said the project could break ground in April 2026 with modular units delivered by October. That timeline would be more likely if the housing nonprofit secures a combined $8.1 million from the town and county. It’s the last bit of funding needed to push the $33 million development over the finish line, she said.

The project will move forward with or without funds from the town and county, Cresswell said, albeit more slowly. 
She’s eyeing funds restricted to rentals for town and county employees. 
In 2022, Teton County voters passed a record-breaking $166 million in Specific Purpose Excise Tax initiatives to be collected over about 10 years in the tourism-driven county. About half — $80 million — in sales tax revenue is going to housing in some form. For example, St. John’s Health will receive $24 million, with half of that going to a nearly $54 million project to build 72 apartments for employees across from the hospital. 
Voters also approved $20 million for town and county employee housing — $10 million for each entity. The request to support the Bridger-Teton project comes as the same pot of money is being mulled for a much larger housing complex, this one from the town and county’s housing department. 
“So any money we allocate to this project would not be available to the Virginian Lane project or other projects,” Town Manager Tyler Sinclair said.
But Housing Director April Norton said there’s a good chance that over 200 homes planned for 90 Virginian Lane, which is facing a $17 million funding gap, would not require Specific Purpose Excise Tax funds. And if “The Virg” does need to dip into the same pool, she said the department would ask for a maximum of $5 million each from the town and county. Funding both projects would leave just shy of $1 million in SPET for each. 
“It could be ‘both, and,’” Norton said.  
Steep cost to stay put
Since at least 2008, the Forest Service has considered building office space and additional employee housing at Nelson Drive next to existing homes for federal workers. Around the same time, the agency was debating whether to keep its main office building in Jackson or move the headquarters to Alpine, Pinedale or Afton where workers would have better odds of securing housing. 
In 2012, the Forest Service chose to build its new administrative building in Jackson on the same site where the old building stood, nestled against the National Elk Refuge at the northern entrance into town. It’s locked them into figuring out how to house their workforce in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, where real estate prices have only become more extreme.
But Hudson, leading the Bridger-Teton National Forest, said it’s a price they’re willing to pay. 
“I think that’s where we belong,” Hudson said.
Hudson said the more than 3-million-acre forest is key to one of the last nearly intact temperate ecosystems in the world. 
“We’re a big player,” Hudson said. 
Being in Jackson allows managers to form relationships across state and federal agencies in the Greater Yellowstone area.
To pay for a new administrative building, the Forest Service sold 10 acres of its public land to private developers for $12 million. Brothers Jim and Kirk Hansen, of the Idaho Falls company Conrad and Bischoff, bought the land and built Hidden Hollow, Jackson’s largest planned development since Cottonwood Park. Over time, the project morphed from ownership units to rentals, many deed-restricted as workforce or affordable.
“But we did not make much progress when it came to our housing, and we’re in a situation now where we’re struggling to maintain a viable workforce,” Hudson said. 
Today, many Bridger-Teton employees continue to commute to Jackson. Others, who should work in Jackson but can’t afford housing, crowd the Pinedale district office.
“If we don’t look outside the box, these kinds of housing units won’t get built.” Jackson Mayor Arne Jorgensen
Proponents see housing on the eastern edge of Jackson as part of the solution.
The Forest Service and Housing Trust unveiled plans for 36 modular rentals at the Nelson Drive trailhead for the first time this fall. The Forest Service issued a 30-year special-use permit for the Housing Trust to construct and manage the modular homes on the federally protected public land.
The permit is an alternative to an outright sale.
“Just like we do for ski resorts,” Hudson said, “they submit an annual operating plan that we approve every year. So we’re still actively engaged in the management of those particular lands.”
Why now?
The Bridger-Teton first approved housing at the Nelson Drive trailhead over a decade ago as part of an environmental review of the sale to Hidden Hollow developers. It’s taken this long to find the right partners and raise the capital, according to Hudson.
“Any kind of affordable housing project in Jackson is incredibly challenging,” Hudson said. “So it has to be subsidized to a certain extent, in this case quite a bit.”
Political will, at least for the town council’s part, also seems strong. 
“This is something novel and exciting,” Councilor Kevin Regan said. “It’s a chance for the Forest Service and Community Housing Trust to serve as thought leaders for this community, this region, and potentially nationally.”
Mayor Arne Jorgensen, a founding board member of the Housing Trust, called the project an innovative solution to leverage local dollars to provide housing for an underfunded Forest Service.
“If we don’t look outside the box, these kinds of housing units won’t get built,” Jorgensen said.
Last chance to weigh in
The federal project is exempt from local development regulations or public comment processes. Recent public reaction has come out in the conversation about financing and it’s been mixed. 
This summer’s congressional effort to sell Western federal public lands, which sparked nationwide pushback, has many leery of private influence on public lands. 
Jackson Hole Conservation Alliance Advocacy Director Catherine Hughes noted the debate at the November meeting, where the town council was poised to vote on spending $4.05 million on the development.
“This project risks paving the way for the same solution just starting at a smaller scale,” Hughes said. “Our community can respond to the need for housing responsibly and protect public lands from a death by a thousand cuts.”
Others have cited traffic, environmental degradation and a potential precedent of sacrificing public lands for development. Grossman said neighbors had long been told the housing would be for federal workers, but the current proposal includes private sector employees too.
If the town and county don’t opt in, the number of private-sector employees could be even greater. One nonprofit, which Cresswell declined to name last week, has committed $3.5 million to the project for its employees. Eligible families still have to meet income and asset limits.
Proponents see the project as a model for housing public employees on the lands they steward. Chris Finlay serves on the Jackson Hole Community Housing Trust board and recently retired after a 32-year career with the National Park Service, over half of that time managing facilities in Grand Teton National Park. During his tenure, the Park Service struggled to build new facilities due to a multi-million-dollar maintenance backlog, he said. 
“Every time we build a new facility, we typically don’t get enough money to maintain those facilities,” Finlay said. “We’re contributing to this deferred maintenance backlog and that’s really why the Park Service is pretty opposed to developing new facilities.”
With the Housing Trust as the permit holder, the Forest Service wouldn’t have to worry about maintenance costs piling up. 
The Jackson Town Council will revisit whether to spend $4.05 million on the project when it meets Dec. 15.

Churches can and should serve those in need, but as a supplement to state-funded programs that help people regardless of their faith, writes columnist Kerry Drake. 
The post Beware of budget cuts that envision churches in charge of social safety net appeared first on WyoFile .","It’s no secret the Wyoming Freedom Caucus wants to slash the state Department of Health’s budget. Now, thanks to a Wyoming Public Radio interview with Rep. John Bear, R-Gillette, we know precisely why.

Opinion

As “chairman emeritus” of the far-right Freedom Caucus that controls the House, Bear’s religious roadmap to change some of the Department of Health’s core missions is frightening.
Bear is also co-chairman of the Joint Appropriations Committee, the powerful panel that oversees the state budget.
He apparently thinks there’s no wall of separation between the church and state that’s guaranteed in the First Amendment, at least not in Wyoming. Bear believes the Legislature would benefit from more Christian lawmakers who think alike and share his moral values.
Bear wants churches to lead some aspects of state government, like mental health and welfare programs like the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. He also thinks churches would do a bang-up job on other government responsibilities such as unemployment benefits.
“When I look at the secular effort for suicide prevention today, it is woefully inadequate,” Bear said. “Woefully inadequate. The reason is because it’s never bringing in that truth that creates hope. Suicide comes from hopelessness.”
Bear voted against a 2021 bill that would have required schools to adopt suicide prevention training. He also opposed a 2023 bill that established a trust fund for the new “988” suicide lifeline.
I’m not suggesting that churches don’t have an important role in helping people who are considering taking their own lives. Churches also distribute food to those who need it, and that’s a great use of their resources.
But the religious community shouldn’t have control over SNAP, unemployment benefits or mental health programs. The fact that Bear and so many members of the Freedom Caucus voted against putting more mental health counselors in schools  is outrageous, especially in light of his comments to WPR.

Bear said in an ideal world, he’d like Wyoming to focus less on mental health programs and psychiatry. He claimed the latter takes “a Marxist view of humanity.”
I don’t know why Bear has it in for the Department of Health. He appointed a three-person JAC subcommittee to examine the department’s budget at a series of public meetings and report back to the full panel.
The subcommittee was chaired by a Freedom Caucus member, Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, and had a Senate ally of the caucus, Sen. Dan Laursen, R-Powell. With the department’s $2.2 billion biennial budget targeted by Bear, I shudder to think about potentially devastating cuts to health services.
There will be time to focus on the Appropriation Committee’s version of the budget from now through the next session, which convenes Feb. 9. Wyomingites should share any concerns to the committee and their legislators.
But voters should pay attention to how Bear views Wyoming’s government and how it could be improved if only more people would go to church (as long as it’s a Christian church with God-fearing people) to keep the devil at bay.
“Number one, we need to draw a line in the sand,” Bear said. “We’re not going to go down this path any further.”
What guides his decision-making?
“Number one is morality,” Bear explained. “And then if it’s not a moral issue, then I go with the constitution. Is it constitutional or not?”
If there’s no issue with those two, he said he goes “with the preponderance of my constituency.”
Does Bear give any weight to the concerns of anyone but Christians who share his views? According to him, it’s the Freedom Caucus members’ alignment on moral values that gives the group its power.
“You need to have good Christians in office,” Bear said. “Not that to be in office, you have to be a Christian, but as Christians, we should try to get as many Christians in office as possible.”

When Bear describes state government, he sees a straight path to the Freedom Caucus obtaining the ability to pass its conservative agenda, and it begins with more people attending church.
“From my point of view, we’ve taken 100 years to get to this point,” Bear said. “That’s not going to be an easy, quick solution, because basically you’ve got to cut taxes and put the money back in people’s pockets, right? Those people have to actually start going to church. So there needs to be revival.”
How about a revival of the separation of church and state? The United States was not, as Bear and many others believe, founded as a Christian nation. Freedom of religion guarantees the right to freely exercise one’s faith and to be free from government imposition of religion.
What former President Jimmy Carter said gets to the heart of the influence of the Freedom Caucus: “There’s no doubt that the Christian right has gone to bed with the more conservative elements of the Republican Party. And there’s been a melding in their goals when it comes to the separation of church and state.”
And from constitutional scholar and comedian George Carlin: “I’m completely in favor of the separation of church and state. My idea is that these two institutions screw us up on their own, so both of them together is certain death.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The pieces are coming together for work to start on a new Tennessee Performing Arts Center as part of a massive project on Nashville’s East Bank.
Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell and TPAC, a nonprofit entity, recently reached an agreement enabling the arts center to relocate from the James K. Polk Building at the corner of Deaderick Boulevard across from the War Memorial Plaza to Metro property at the base of the Seigenthaler Pedestrian Bridge, an area now used for Tennessee Titans parking.
The State Building Commission approved a $200 million grant for the TPAC project in 2023 and is expected to authorize another $300 million for the job now that a deal has been reached. TPAC is to raise another $100 million from private sources.
A Piedmont Gas pipeline is to be moved before ground work can start on the building in early 2027 with completion slated around 2030.
“This agreement ensures Metro and TPAC will partner on related infrastructure costs and advances a key piece of the East Bank redevelopment,” O’Connell said in a statement.
TPAC, which will be an anchor for the East Bank area along the Cumberland River, will share infrastructure costs with Metro and allow it to use the center for educational purposes under the agreement. 
Outgoing Nashville official defends East Bank development contract

House Speaker Cameron Sexton, who serves on the East Bank Development Authority Board, urged a 2030 completion date.
“I appreciate Mayor O’Connell personally taking over the negotiations with TPAC and getting a deal done,” Sexton said in a statement. “This is a significant milestone for our state and Nashville to compete as a vibrant performing arts community. TPAC will be a valued addition to the East Bank and Lower Broad area that will enhance the entertainment district.”
Sexton this fall criticized Metro Nashville chief development officer Bob Mendes’ negotiation of a development contract with Boston-based Fallon Company that he said was too favorable to the company and cost the local government money. Mendes left the post in late October.
TPAC is contributing $24 million to infrastructure costs, including $15.8 million for Victory Drive and Davidson Road improvements, utilities and connection to the pedestrian bridge. Metro will cover other infrastructure expenses related to the pedestrian bridge and a greenway connector.
Previous estimates had TPAC’s share of expenses at $67.6 million.
Cost overruns are to be paid by TPAC, which is being required to meet project deadlines. The arts center also will use Metro-owned parking at market rates.
Amid the TPAC-Metro deal, construction workers recently raised the final beam on a $2.1 billion enclosed stadium being built next to the old Titans stadium. It is to open in 2027. 
The Metro Nashville Council unanimously approved a 99-year lease deal with Fallon for 30 city-owned acres in April 2024. The property could have reverted to Fallon if Metro Nashville and TPAC hadn’t reached an agreement.
In addition, tech giant Oracle is to build a campus on 60 acres in the area after receiving a $175 million economic incentive grant from Metro.
Fallon is responsible for building 1,550 residential units on the property, 695 of which are to be designated as “affordable,” meaning they will be priced for those at 30-80% of the median income.

(Courtesy photos)A decorated West Virginia veteran has called for the two National Guard members shot in Washington, D.C., to receive a Purple Heart award.
U.S. Army Spc. Sarah Beckstrom, 20, died on Thanksgiving as a result of her injuries, and U.S. Air Force Staff Sgt. Andrew Wolfe, 24, remains in the hospital with severe wounds.  
The pair were ambushed Nov. 25 while on duty blocks from the White House while hundreds of Guard members were in D.C. for President Donald Trump’s “Operation D.C. Safe and Beautiful.” 
“This was an act of terrorism. This was premeditated,” said Retired U.S. Army Capt. James L. McCormick, a three-time Purple Heart recipient from New Haven, West Virginia, who is making a push for Beckstrom and Wolfe to receive the award.
“I pray to God Almighty that they get the Purple Heart, and that those that heroically stood up and fought off this guy that they’re properly recognized,” he said.
McCormick believes that the nature of the targeted attack on Beckstrom and Wolfe makes them worthy of receiving the Purple Heart, a military honor given to military members injured or killed while serving.
An Afghan national, Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, was charged with one count of murder after the attack on the Guard members, as well as two counts of assault with the intent to kill, and a count of possession of a firearm during a crime of violence. Lakanwal pleaded not guilty.
McCormick received his Purple Hearts while participating in Operation Iraqi Freedom II and III in 2004. He suffered multiple gunshot wounds and injuries from a roadside bomb blast within five months. 
He previously served as the national commander of the Military Order of the Purple Heart and now sits on the organization’s board. 
A Purple Heart designation comes with benefits that include priority for medical care from the VA, home loan benefits, employment preference and more. McCormick noted that a Purple Heart award includes benefits for deceased veterans’ families, which could be used by Beckstrom’s family.
As Gov. Patrick Morrisey has come under scrutiny for deploying Guard members to D.C., McCormick said the debate about the mission shouldn’t detract from honoring Beckstrom and Wolfe. 
“People like Sarah Beckstrom were defending not only the rights of the innocent people here, but she was also defending the rights of these people to be able to peacefully protest,” McCormick said.
Public or elected officials could reach out to the Department of War to push for the Purple Heart designation, McCormick said. Trump and military department secretaries have the authority to award the Purple Heart. 
“They did a great service. Who knows how many lives that they saved?” McCormick said. 
Beckstrom’s family has asked that in lieu of flowers to remember her life, donations be made to the Nicholas County Humane Society or the Wounded Warrior Project.
Funeral services for Beckstrom will be private.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)A coalition dubbed Restore Our Fairgrounds is calling for a voter referendum to block NASCAR-style racing in favor of affordable housing and green space at the Fairgrounds in South Nashville, the latest measure in a two-decade effort to strip auto racing from the property.
The group said it filed paperwork Monday with the Metro Clerk to start a charter amendment ending auto racing at the Metro Nashville Fairgrounds amid rumors about Mayor Freddie O’Connell and Speedway Motorsports negotiating a deal for NASCAR-type expansion. The group says resumption of car races would hurt local taxpayers and cause more traffic and noise. 
If successful, the amendment would undo a 2011 referendum that amended the charter to protect existing uses of the Fairgrounds, including auto racing. The measure passed with 72% of voters approving it. 
That’s lawsuit number four: Metro Nashville draws another lawsuit in Fairgrounds Speedway deal

Metro Nashville voters would have to vote in favor of a referendum to end racing at the Fairgrounds, which was home to different types of racing for more than 100 years.
The group supports the preservation of green space, development of affordable housing and improvements to nearby Brown’s Creek, a tributary to Cumberland River on the federal EPA list of polluted waterways.
Multiple Nashville groups, such as Belmont Hillsboro Neighbors, NOAH Economic Equity, Jobs & Transportation Task Force and South Nashville Action People (SNAP) are part of the coalition.
Mike Kopp, co-founder of Fairgrounds Preservation Partners, is among those signing the petition, along with Metro Council member Terry Vo, Heidi Basgall-Favorite, founder of Neighbors Opposing Track Expansion, and Jose Gonzales, co-found of Conexion Americas.
Cars raced on a dirt track at the Fairgrounds into the late 1950s until NASCAR’s Cup Series ran there until 1984. Xfinity and Truck races remained until 25 years ago.

(Photo courtesy of Panhandle Special Needs Inc.)Andrew Rogers is 33 years old, lives in an apartment in Sandpoint, works at the local Safeway store and is self-sufficient.
It’s a “normal” lifestyle by any measure – something that didn’t appear to be possible 12 years ago. Autism didn’t hold back Andrew, and his life changed for the better when Panhandle Special Needs Inc. entered the picture.
As he explains, “It opened doors for things I couldn’t do. I learned how to manage a budget, shop, do housecleaning, how to cook different foods and how to do laundry.”
Megan Albertson, administrative assistant for Panhandle Special Needs, saw a much different person in 2013.
“When he first came to us, he struggled with anxiety, depression, low self-esteem and a fear of anything new. And that was in addition to his diagnosis of mild intellectual disability with a development age of about eight and a half years,” she said. “His parents were convinced he faced significant barriers to independence and would never be able to live on his own.”
Living on his own didn’t happen overnight – the Panhandle Special Needs staff spent many hours, and Andrew spent a lot of classroom time, learning the basics of independent living. In 2017, he moved into his own apartment – beaming with pride – and by 2018 his goal was met.
“He proved to himself, his parents and our staff that he was fully capable of independent living, just like we knew he could,” says Albertson. “We continued to challenge him with more advanced skills – things like portion control, problem solving and cooking complex meals.”
Andrew’s parents moved to Arizona three years ago, and Andrew went with them for a brief period. He decided that he wanted to move back to Sandpoint.
“I couldn’t get into an apartment – it was literally impossible,” he said. “I couldn’t get a job and they didn’t have services for people with my level of disability. Here, they have everything.”
Look at him now, says Albertson. “He’s here, living 100 percent independently.”
Andrew’s is not the only success story within Panhandle Special Needs. The Sandpoint-based nonprofit organization has been around for 50 years, serving people with disabilities in Bonner and Boundary counties. Trinity Nicholson, the executive director for 25 years, has on file a long list of testimonials from participants, caregivers and even staff members who sing praises about the work environment. It all speaks well of the value of Panhandle Special Needs and Nicholson’s leadership.
PSNI serves about 200 clients a year, offering a wide range of services and employment opportunities. There are not a lot of places like this. Board members are unpaid and funding predominantly comes from Medicaid, with in-house programs providing some revenue. As with nonprofits in general, private donations play a big part in the service’s viability.
“We see people moving here from other states to get services,” Nicholson says. “We serve families, not just individuals. As demands grow, we don’t want to be just OK in doing a lot of things. We want to be really good at providing services.”
In the process, Bonner and Boundary counties are a better place to live. Over decades, Panhandle Special Needs has served scores of disabled people and, in many cases, sparing families from severe financial hardships. Andrew Rogers has an idea how his life would be without this service.
“I’d be living with my parents for the rest of my life.”

The North Dakota Constitution requires at least four of five justices to find a state law unconstitutional. (Pool photo by Tanner Ecker/Bismarck Tribune)An unusual clause in the North Dakota Constitution that limits the power of the courts kept the state’s near-total abortion ban from being struck down last month.
Most state Supreme Courts require a majority vote to declare a law unconstitutional. But in North Dakota, it takes a supermajority — a vote of at least four justices — for the Supreme Court to strike down a law. That’s why the state’s 2023 abortion law remains on the books even though three of five justices on the high court found it unconstitutionally vague under the North Dakota Constitution.
The only other state that requires a judicial supermajority to find a state law unconstitutional is Nebraska.
North Dakota voters adopted the rule into the state constitution in 1918 as a way to temper the power of the courts. It was established through a constitutional amendment put on the ballot by lawmakers affiliated with the nascent North Dakota Nonpartisan League.
The party pushed for the supermajority amendment out of fear that the Supreme Court would undermine its legal reforms, according to a 2015 academic article published in the University of Toledo Law Review. The Nonpartisan League spearheaded several Progressive Era changes to state government, including the creation of the Bank of North Dakota and the North Dakota Mill and Elevator.
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

North Dakota Supreme Court Chief Justice Jon Jensen in a January dissenting opinion called the five-justice rule an important part of the court’s duty to be deferential to decisions made by the legislative branch.
Douglas Keith, a legal expert at the Brennan Center for Justice, said while courts in some other countries also have supermajority requirements, it’s practically unheard of in the United States.
“Likely, it stems from how odd it looks to the public,” said Keith, who researches state courts.
The rule enables minority views to decide the outcome of cases, which some could view as undemocratic, Keith said.
“It creates this strange imbalance where you need a much smaller number of justices to uphold a law,” he said.
On the other hand, some have criticized simple majority requirements as vulnerable to political polarization.
“Judicial decisions should take into account the full range of considerations, not just one side or the other,” said David Orentlicher, a professor at the University of Nevada Las Vegas School of Law and a Democratic member of the Nevada Legislature. 
Orentlicher authored a 2022 academic article arguing for the U.S. Supreme Court to decide all of its cases unanimously. He said that this would force it to make fairer decisions that balance the viewpoints of all justices.
Unpacking North Dakota’s gender-affirming care ruling

North Dakota’s supermajority rule doesn’t impact most of the court’s business. It only applies when it reviews a constitutional challenge to a state law.
“Until this particular ruling, I hadn’t even heard of it,” said Bradley Myers, interim dean of the University of North Dakota School of Law.
The North Dakota Supreme Court handed down another split decision on another state abortion policy about a decade ago.
The lawsuit challenged part of the law that regulates medication abortion. It survived a constitutional challenge in 2014 despite three justices voting that it violated the federal Constitution. The three justices concluded that the law places an undue burden on women’s ability to obtain an abortion before the point of fetal viability, which at the time was a federally recognized right.
In that case, two justices declared that the law violates the North Dakota Constitution, two found it does not and the fifth justice found that the law should only be analyzed under the federal Constitution and declined to take a position.
When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, control over abortion access was handed back to state governments.
The North Dakota Supreme Court also handed down a split ruling on the state’s K-12 funding formula in 1994. Three of five justices found the formula violated the state constitution by funding school districts unequally.
If North Dakotans wanted to change the supermajority rule, voters could circulate a petition to put a constitutional amendment on the election ballot.
The Legislature could also vote to refer the matter to the ballot.
North Dakota’s abortion law makes abortion illegal in all cases except rape or incest if the mother has been pregnant less than six weeks, or when the pregnancy presents a serious physical health threat.

(Photo by Elaine S. Povich/Stateline)In West Virginia, we talk a lot about work. We want people to show up, punch the clock and pull their weight. But there is an uncomfortable truth we keep dodging: you can’t have a strong workforce if parents have no safe, reliable, high-quality places to leave their children.
That’s why it’s time for West Virginia to pay the true cost of child care for families who use the state child care subsidy.
Right now, our subsidy system is built on wishful thinking. The state reimburses child care programs at rates that are well below what it actually costs to provide minimal care. National estimates of the “true cost” of high-quality care show the gap clearly: caring for an infant at a high-quality level can cost more than $25,400 per year, but the average subsidized rate for infant care in West Virginia is only about $9,079. 
That difference doesn’t magically disappear. Someone is paying for it — and right now, it’s a toxic mix of underpaid educators, struggling programs, and parents who don’t receive subsidies being charged more to make up the gap.
High quality early care isn’t a luxury
High-quality early childhood education is not “babysitting.” It’s skilled work that shapes the brain development, social skills, and school readiness of our youngest West Virginians. When classrooms are staffed with stable, trained teachers; when ratios are low enough for children to get real attention; when environments are safe and rich with learning — children do better in school, need fewer special education services, and are more likely to graduate and find good jobs later in life. That’s not ideology; it’s decades of research. But quality costs money:

Living wages and benefits for staff so they stay in the field 
Safe, licensed facilities that meet health and safety standards
Training, curriculum, screenings, and family support

If the state only pays a “discount” rate through subsidy, providers have two choices: cut quality or find the money somewhere else. Too often, they’re forced to do both.
How underpaying the child care subsidy hurts private-pay parents
The child care subsidy is supposed to help low- and moderate-income families afford child care. But when the state rate is below the true cost, programs must fill the hole.
That usually looks like:

Raising tuition on families who pay out-of-pocket to offset the shortfall
Packing more children into classrooms or cutting corners to cut costs 
Keeping wages low, causing constant turnover and burnout

In practice, this means a family just over the subsidy income cutoff — or a family who can’t access subsidy for other reasons — may end up paying more than they should, simply because the program is trying to survive on inadequate public funding.
So instead of subsidy leveling the playing field, it creates financial hardships:

Subsidy families are in programs that are financially fragile
Non-subsidy families are charged higher rates to cover the gap
Both groups experience staff turnover, closures, or waiting lists.

When we talk about “paying the true cost of child care,” we’re saying the state should stop quietly shifting its responsibility onto parents and educators.
Child care closures are a workforce crisis
West Virginia already has one of the lowest labor force participation rates in the country — about 54.3% as of August 2025, compared to over 69% in some other states. Business leaders have raised the alarm about our shrinking workforce and what it means for economic growth.
You cannot fix that without fixing child care.
Across the state, we’re seeing:

Roughly 1,200 licensed child care providers, yet more than 25,000 children who still don’t have access to care because there simply aren’t enough slots.
Reports that hundreds of child care providers have left the industry since early 2023 as federal relief funds ended and costs rose.

When a child care program closes or shrinks, parents don’t just lose a service — many lose the ability to work. Moms, in particular, are often pushed out of jobs or forced into part-time work when they can’t find or afford care. Employers struggle to fill openings and retain staff. Communities lose both jobs at the child care center and productivity in other industries.
This is not just a “family issue.” It is the core economic infrastructure. If we allowed this to happen to our roads or electric grid, we’d call it what it is: a statewide crisis.
Market rates don’t reflect reality — true cost modeling does
Historically, many states, including West Virginia, have set child care subsidy rates based on market rate surveys — essentially, “what are providers charging now?” The problem is that these prices are already constrained by what parents can pay, not what it actually costs to run a high-quality program. National analysis shows that the true cost of providing care exceeds not only subsidy rates but often the price charged to families as well.
Paying the true cost of child care for subsidy means:

 Basing reimbursement on cost models, not just market rates, and updating them regularly. 
 Recognizing higher costs for infants, toddlers, and rural programs, where staffing and transportation challenges are different. 
 Ensuring rates support living wages and benefits for early educators, so we stop losing them to less stressful, higher-paying jobs in retail or fast food.

When subsidy pays the true cost, programs no longer need to overcharge private-pay families or cut quality just to keep the lights on.
This is a smart economic development strategy
West Virginia pours time and money into trying to attract businesses and grow jobs. But businesses look for a stable, dependable workforce — and they know childcare is a huge part of that.
We’re already experimenting with promising models like cost-sharing “tri-share” programs, where employers, parents and the state each pay a portion of child care costs. Those efforts are helpful, but they are small and limited in geography. They also allow winners and losers across the state based on what employers can afford AND choose to participate. They will never allow for parents working state or government jobs to participate and benefit. Think teachers, police, emergency service personnel, VA employees, CPS workers, etc. Tri-Share cannot replace a strong, statewide subsidy system that pays the true cost of care.
If lawmakers are serious about boosting labor force participation, they should treat child care:

Like public infrastructure, not a private luxury service 
Like a workforce investment, not a line item to squeeze 
Like education, because that’s what it is for our youngest children

Paying the true cost of child care through subsidy is one of the most direct, targeted economic development policies we can enact.
More parents can work. More child care programs can stay open and expand. More early educators can afford to stay in the field. More children enter school ready to learn, forming the future workforce our economy will depend on.

Kennedy Jr. is undermining vaccine protections for children and reversing historic public health gains. (Getty Images)Three Kentucky babies are dead from whooping cough, a disease we know how to prevent. What kind of society lets children die from a solved problem? Their deaths were not inevitable. 
In Kentucky, we know what vaccine-preventable disease looks like. Our own Sen. Mitch McConnell lives with the lifelong effects of childhood polio. Public health once eliminated diseases like polio, but today that legacy is beginning to unravel. U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is the one pulling at the threads. 
As families grieve the unthinkable, Kennedy’s handpicked vaccine panel weakened hepatitis B protections for newborns. 
During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy explicitly told senators, “I support the measles vaccine, I support the polio vaccines, I will do nothing as HHS secretary that makes it difficult or discourages people taking them.”
He pledged to Sen. Bill Cassidy that he would maintain the Centers for Disease Control’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) “without changes.”
Secretary of U.S. Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr. speaks at the Rx and Illicit Drug Summit at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 24, 2025. (John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
He committed to Sen. Todd Young to prioritize funding for long COVID research. 
These statements were made under oath before the U.S. Senate. They weren’t vague campaign promises; they were direct assurances to senators whose votes secured his confirmation.
Less than a year later,  Kennedy has broken each one of these commitments.  
In June, he fired all 17 members of ACIP, the independent expert panel that sets national vaccine recommendations, and replaced them with anti-vaccine activists. His picks include Robert Malone, known for spreading COVID misinformation, and Vicky Pebsworth, a board member of an anti-vaccine organization. Four appointees are even listed in the dedication of Kennedy’s anti-vaccine book, a move that puts allies over experts.

The American Academy of Pediatrics responded with alarm, warning, “families and children will be the ones to pay the price.”
Kentucky families are already paying it. We have recorded 566 pertussis (whooping cough) cases this year. The most recent death will be recorded as a statistic, but that baby had a name, a story, a family. Politicians claim to care about children, but caring means telling the truth. Whooping cough is deadly to infants, and vaccines in pregnancy and early childhood are how we keep them alive. 
Vaccines are not the only part of public health under attack. Kennedy eliminated the HHS Office of Long COVID even as new research shows it has overtaken asthma as the most common chronic illness in children. He shut down the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration during an overdose crisis. In Kentucky, where rural hospitals are stretched thin and addiction is a leading cause of premature death, these cuts are deadly. 
Kennedy is reviving the long-debunked claim that vaccines cause autism. To do this, he hired David Geier, who was fined for practicing medicine without a license by the state of Maryland after he and his father gave autistic children dangerous hormone injections without informed consent. Now Kennedy has put him in charge of a federal study designed to “prove” that vaccines are dangerous. 
Recklessness like this has already caused harm. During the worst measles resurgence in decades, with 17 outbreaks across the U.S., including two in Kentucky, Kennedy promoted vitamin A as a treatment. Shortly after, Texas doctors treated children for vitamin A toxicity and liver damage.  
RFK Jr. has broken his promises, undermined science and jeopardized the health of millions.
Kentucky’s McConnell put it plainly during Kennedy’s confirmation: “I will not condone the re-litigation of proven cures, and neither will millions of Americans who credit their survival and quality of life to scientific miracles.” 
The question now is whether we will allow a fourth Kentucky infant to die from a preventable disease. 
Three Kentucky families are living every parent’s worst nightmare, and Kennedy’s panel just voted to put more infants at risk by dismantling the hepatitis B birth-dose recommendation. The birth dose exists because screening alone fails; thousands of pregnant patients are never tested, and their newborns become infected before anyone realizes they’re at risk. When infants contract hepatitis B, nearly 90% become chronic carriers, condemned to a lifetime threatened by cirrhosis and liver cancer. Decades of data show exactly what happens when the birth dose is limited to “high-risk” infants — infection rates rise, and children pay the price. 
This reversal undermines the 99% decline in childhood hepatitis B that public health achieved. It was a political decision with medical consequences for babies who haven’t even taken their first steps. The senators who confirmed Kennedy on the strength of his promises now have a responsibility to act. 
When someone breaks sworn commitments and endangers children, there must be consequences. Kentucky’s congressional delegation can lead that response by demanding Kennedy’s immediate resignation from office.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/baby-hand-700x467-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

(Photo by  Aaron Sutch/Solar United Neighbors)With Democrats in full control of the General Assembly and Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger preparing to take office, lawmakers are reviving familiar proposals they hope will finally earn a governor’s signature. Chief among them are bills aimed at expanding renewable energy use and strengthening Virginia’s clean-energy workforce.
Sen. Jennifer Carroll Foy, D-Prince William, has filed Senate Bill 26, which would allow localities to require developers to build solar canopies over parking lots as part of their development ordinances.
“I think that solar canopies can go far in ensuring that we have more accessible space to have solar and to get developers, and not only suburban, but rural areas as well, to do their part to help us with our expansion into more clean energy,” Carroll Foy said.
The requirement would apply only to nonresidential parking lots with more than 100 spaces, and localities could mandate canopies on up to 50% of the lot, according to the bill. It also gives localities flexibility to waive the requirement if the added cost would be prohibitive for companies building initial projects.
Carroll Foy said she wants to give individual counties more tools to help the state meet its Virginia Clean Economy Act targets while getting as many kilowatts on the grid as possible without sacrificing agricultural land for utility-scale solar projects.
“I think this is low hanging fruit,” Carroll Foy said. “If we can put as many solar panels as possible on top of schools, on top of parking garages, on space that’s available but unusable for pretty much anything else, I think that makes total sense, and it also helps us preserve our farmland.”
A similar measure passed the General Assembly during the 2025 regular session, but Gov. Glenn Youngkin vetoed it, arguing that parking lot solar is too expensive and that “if it were economically viable, developers would already be incorporating it into their projects.”
Across the aisle, Del. Delores Oates, R-Warren, is introducing a bill that would allow the use of small solar panels that plug directly into a home outlet and can be set up on a balcony without a utility contract. The goal is to help homeowners offset some of their electricity use when they are unable to participate in rooftop solar programs.
“Right now, solar is something you can only do if you own a house and have the right kind of roof,” Oates said. “This bill opens the door for everyone else: apartment-dwellers, condo owners, and people in homes shaded by trees. It’s a small change that helps a lot of people.”
The small portable panels are estimated to cost $600-1200 and can offset an estimated $10-20 on utility bills, according to Oates.
Carroll Foy is also again pushing to strengthen the offshore wind workforce in Virginia with Senate Bill 25. 
Despite the Trump Administration pulling funding for several offshore wind projects, Dominion Energy’s major project off Virginia’s coast remains on track to begin operating in 2026. Carroll Foy said she wants to ensure workers are trained for the offshore wind sector and the broader renewable energy industry.
“Unfortunately, we have a federal administration and we had some Republicans who don’t believe in the climate crisis, but I believe in science backed and not science fiction,” Carroll Foy said. “And whatever we can do to ensure that we can continue to build our clean energy projects, while also putting Virginians to work and addressing any shortage that we may have in this industry or in the Department of Energy, then that’s exactly what we want to do.”
The bill directs the Virginia Department of Energy to establish training programs for the offshore wind industry and to prioritize veterans, local workers, and disadvantaged communities.
Youngkin vetoed the same bill last year, saying that rising project costs and project cancellations made additional workforce investment unwise.
Both bills will be taken up during the 2026 regular session, which begins Jan. 14.

Choe’s appointment comes as VRE — which connects Northern and Central Virginia with Washington, D.C. — continues advancing its modernization plans outlined in the system’s long-term strategy, aimed at adapting to changing travel patterns, maximizing daily ridership and adding non-peak and weekend service.
Choe was appointed last week by VRE’s governing bodies — the Northern Virginia Transportation Commission and the Potomac Rappahannock Transportation Commission — replacing Rich Dalton, who served the agency for 16 years.
“I am honored to join VRE at such a significant moment for regional mobility,” Choe said in a statement. “VRE plays a critical role in connecting communities and supporting economic growth across Northern and Central Virginia and the greater Washington region.”

Choe joins VRE after holding several senior roles, most recently serving in Massachusetts as chief of staff to the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, chief engineer for Boston Public Works and program manager at the Massachusetts Port Authority. 
She has overseen major infrastructure projects focused on safety and quality and was named WTS-Boston’s Woman of the Year in 2022.
Choe has worked in program management and safety oversight leadership in the transportation sector for 25 years.
Choe will take the helm as VRE prepares for a series of infrastructure projects scheduled over the next five years, including the Virginia Passenger Rail Authority’s Long Bridge improvement project. The expansion will add new rail capacity for freight and passenger service between Washington, D.C. and Virginia, easing the longstanding bottleneck that has slowed travel times across the region.
“The VRE Operations Board believes Ms. Choe is uniquely qualified as VRE’s next CEO,” said VRE Operations Board Chair and Alexandria Vice Mayor Sarah Bagley in a statement. “Her record of delivering transformative results for organizations through innovative, safety-oriented, and people-first leadership reflects the core values held dear at VRE.”

ICE arrests in the Pittsburgh region reached a high point in July and August at around 140 each month — more than double the number logged during any month for two years prior.
That arrest level appears to have tapered off slightly in September, as the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown approaches the end of its first year.
Since January, there have been at least 948 immigration-related arrests in the Pittsburgh region, defined as a 50-mile radius from Downtown, according to the data, which ends in mid-October. That is more than triple the same period in 2024, during which the agency made 275 arrests.

Prior to President Donald Trump’s inauguration and his Immigration and Customs Enforcement surge, the number of ICE arrests in Allegheny County and nearby counties in a given month was sometimes as low as a dozen or as high as 65. The range this year has been a low of 48 in April before the summer peak, according to data made available by the Deportation Data Project and analyzed by Pittsburgh’s Public Source.
The data shows the vast majority of the ICE arrests as occurring in or close to Pittsburgh and is only more specific in regard to pickups at county jails. Just one of this year’s ICE arrests is listed as occurring at the Allegheny County Jail, with outlying county lockups logging larger tallies, led by Beaver (23), Washington (18) and Butler (10).
The region has not seen the kind of highly publicized ICE surges experienced by numerous other cities, including recent pushes in and around Minneapolis, Charlotte and Chicago.

But Southwestern Pennsylvania hasn’t been ignored by the rapidly expanding agency. The administration’s immigration-related activities have reached the area in many ways throughout the year, including:

November efforts to enlist local law enforcement agencies in enforcement activity, some of which were recently reversed after Public Source inquiries
September moves to deport Guatemalan children, which were stalled by court decisions but caused local advocates to scramble over Labor Day weekend
August arrests of workers at local restaurants
A midsummer blitz in Ambridge that some advocates for immigrants characterized as the most aggressive they’d seen
Winter disruptions of funding for refugee resettlement and for legal representation of immigrant children
A January pause in refugee entry, which has since morphed nationally into a halt to processing of applications from 19 countries following the November shooting of two National Guard members — one fatally — in Washington, D.C.

ICE’s increased activity has been met locally with vigorous countermeasures, notably including a Rapid Response Network that has frequently deployed volunteers to document enforcement actions. Anti-Trump protests and other activism in the region have sometimes focused tightly on immigration policy, highlighted the importance of immigrants to the economy or included those themes in broad critiques of the administration. Churches, meanwhile, have attempted to serve as spiritual sanctuaries for the region’s Latino population, even as attendance has sometimes been depressed by fear.
Other local effects of administration action to curb the flow of people from other countries to the U.S. include a reduced international student population at Carnegie Mellon University and measures by the University of Pittsburgh and potentially other large employers to adjust to a new fee on visas used by many skilled workers from abroad.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ice-arrests-ambridge-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

With similarly sporadic precipitation trends predicted to continue, what that means for drinking water reliability in the state is still unclear — and the cost of coping is continuing to rise.
In response to widespread reports of dry wells and associated financial hardship, the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services is set to restart a financial assistance program to aid qualifying low-income households who have lost access to drinking water due to drought conditions. The Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund Advisory Commission voted in November to allocate just under $2 million to this phase of the program, which has run twice before, both times within the last five years. 
The funds will help some residents with steep costs associated with drilling new, more reliable wells. But as significant droughts become increasingly common, some experts said it would take more investment and more creativity to make New Hampshire’s drinking water supplies more resilient into the future.
Ensuring a reliable drinking water supply is a significant concern for the state, said Ted Diers, assistant water division director at the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services, in an interview. “It’s pretty hard to think of anything more fundamental,” he said.
A report released Dec. 4 by the U.S. Drought Monitor shows a majority of New Hampshire remaining in “severe drought” status. While precipitation has begun to increase in most areas, it will take time for groundwater to recharge — and it’s difficult to say just how long that might take, experts said. “This drought, it was a doozy,” said Ted Diers, assistant water division director with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services.

Drought cycles put periodic pressure on aquifers
This season’s rash of dry wells accompanied the state’s driest summer on record. While New Hampshire’s annual precipitation totals are increasing with climate change, precipitation events are also becoming more unevenly distributed throughout the year. This means that long periods without any rain are becoming typical for summer and early fall, New Hampshire State Climatologist Mary Stampone said in October. 
These cycles are predicted to continue, something groundwater experts said could affect drinking water supplies, too, though exactly how will vary across the state.
Snowmelt and rain feed the aquifers that, in turn, feed drinking water wells, said Mike Howley, senior geoscientist with the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services and program manager of the state’s Groundwater Measuring Network. But the dozens of monitoring wells that NHDES and the New Hampshire Geological Survey maintain across the state show how that happens is variable. In some places, fresh rainfall will recharge groundwater in a matter of hours; in others, it might take three to six months for water to work its way through the soil, Howley said.
Similarly, the effects of a drought might not be immediately ameliorated when precipitation begins to fall again. This means that even once a dry spell ends, the time it will take for some aquifers to recover can be substantial, Howley said. This can make it difficult to help those with dry wells predict when or if their issues will resolve.
In New England, it is common for aquifers to show the effects of precipitation trends within a relatively short period, according to Joseph Ayotte, hydrologic investigative branch chief with the United States Geological Survey’s New England Water Science Center. This, he said, is because aquifers in our area have “relatively low storage” compared to those in other regions of the country. 
“When precipitation tails off, water levels in our aquifers can start to decline, and that is usually concerning for folks,” he said, noting that an example of such a decline occurred this summer and fall.
Meanwhile, however, lower-capacity aquifers also take less time to refill when rain does fall again. Ayotte said this can occur even throughout the winter months, when groundwater typically continues to work its way through the portions of the ground that do not freeze.
Ayotte added he had not seen research directly assessing whether groundwater was becoming increasingly unreliable in New Hampshire. More data is needed, he said, to assess how changing surface weather patterns are reflected below ground. But the relatively fast reactivity of New England’s aquifers is a reason that increasingly uneven precipitation patterns could strain groundwater, he said, even while precipitation becomes more abundant overall.
“The trick is that those precipitation amounts vary seasonally. There may be periods of time where we have a fairly long window without precipitation, which could potentially affect the reliability of the water supply,” Ayotte said.
Regional water cycles
The historic drought that occurred in New Hampshire this year engulfed, at its worst, the entire state. The region most affected (and, according to data released by the U.S. Drought Monitor, still almost entirely in “severe drought” as of Dec. 4) was central and northern New Hampshire.
Data collected by the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services in summer and fall 2025 show recent well reports per 10,000 residents, broken down by county. The areas with the highest proportions of dry wells were concentrated in the North Country due to a deep drought across the region, according to Ted Diers, Assistant Water Division Director at the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. (Chart courtesy of the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services)
This is reflected in the distribution of dry wells reported throughout the state, Diers said. The Department of Environmental Services set up an online dry well reporting form in September and had received 201 reports of completely or intermittently dry wells as of Dec. 4. Adjusted by population, rates of dry wells were highest in the North Country. Coös County had the highest dry well-to-resident ratio, with 10.2 dry wells reported per 10,000 residents; Grafton and Carroll counties reported the next highest rates.
Reporting is entirely voluntary, said Diers, who speculated that not everyone whose well has gone dry in the state ultimately knew about the reporting system and filled out the survey. 
“My guess is the number is four or five times that, but I don’t really have a way of documenting that,” he said in an interview.
Though the state is small, diversity in topography and weather patterns mean that precipitation often varies widely across regions, Diers said.
“What we’ve seen is that these droughts tend to go in cycles in different parts of the state,” he said. Dry conditions in the Seacoast within the last decade led many residents there to confront well supply issues. Now, he said, the North Country is being forced down the same path.
Confronting high costs
About half of New Hampshire residents get their water from private wells, according to the New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services. For these individuals, water supply issues can present a significant financial challenge, as costs to drill new wells are rising fast. The department now considers the average cost for a new bedrock well to be $30,000, Diers said. 
“If you’re a very low-income person, this is how you lose a house,” he said at the Nov. 17 meeting of the Drinking Water and Groundwater Advisory Commission.
The emergency assistance program, as approved by the commission that day, will pay the entire cost of a new well for households earning less than half of their area’s median household income. For households earning between half and 80% of their area’s median household income, the program will cover half the total cost of a new well; in both cases, the funding will be released as a reimbursement to the well driller from the Drinking Water and Groundwater Trust Fund.
The commission allocated $1.5 million in trust dollars to the program Nov. 17, and agreed to reallocate $300,000 remaining from a similar program activated in response to dry well reports in 2021 and 2023, Diers said. The $1.8 million total allocated to this cycle could finance approximately 60 average wells.
In addition to rising costs, Diers pointed to New Hampshire’s aging population as another factor making the emergency assistance program necessary. Older residents on fixed incomes may not be able to spring for a new well, leaving them without water, he said. 
Long wait times for well drilling and a high level of need are two challenges that the department anticipates the program will be faced with again this year, Diers said. Applications for assistance will open in the new year, he said at the meeting.

Getting creative
Ayotte, Howley, and Diers stressed the importance of long-term monitoring in efforts to build a deeper understanding of how surface weather patterns affect groundwater. Building rich data sets with the 48 monitoring wells the N.H. Geological Survey manages across the state will help inform efforts to understand regional differences in groundwater availability, the effects of severe weather events, and the effects of water use, Howley said.
“Long-term data is a real gem. It’s something that we all need, and it’s the only real way to evaluate change,” Ayotte said
Additionally, as the pressures on groundwater evolve, making water supplies more reliable in the long term might take more than a series of existing well replacements. With more precipitation expected to continue falling overall, finding ways to tap into this sporadic but increasing supply could be a path to resilience, Ayotte said.
“Perhaps there will need to be changes in how we access that water, because it should be there,” he said.
As an example, Ayotte pointed to a collaboration between the New England Water Science Center and the University of Maine exploring changes to standard wells that could make them more resilient. One project looks at expanding shallow, dug wells, which are less expensive but considered less reliable, and more susceptible to contamination, than drilled bedrock wells.
A typical dug well might be three feet across and 20 feet deep, Ayotte said. But by increasing the width of the well to as much as 30 feet across, the team increased both the storage capacity and surface area of the well, creating a more reliable water supply. 
“That seems to make all the difference,” Ayotte said.
This finding will likely be most applicable to farmers, Ayotte said, but it is an example of how rethinking existing technology could help make wells more secure even in times of drought.
“It seems like we’re going to remain water-rich,” Ayotte said. “We just may need to rethink how we produce water for the water supply.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Adrinkingwater-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Derrin Robinson has worked in Oregon elections for more than 30 years, long enough to remember when voters in the state cast their ballots at physical polling sites instead of by mail.
As the nonpartisan clerk of Harney County, a vast, rural expanse larger than Massachusetts, Robinson oversees elections with about 6,000 registered voters. Oregon has exclusively conducted elections by mail since 2000, a system he thinks works well, requires fewer staff and doesn’t force voters to travel through treacherous weather to reach a polling place.
“As you can tell, I’m not an advocate for going back,” Robinson said.
Not everyone agrees. An Oregon Republican lawmaker has introduced legislation to end the state’s mail voting law, and organizers of a ballot measure campaign seeking to ban mail-in voting say they have gathered thousands of signatures.
Across the United States, voting by mail faces a moment of uncertainty ahead of the midterm elections next year.
President Donald Trump has assailed mail-in voting and vowed this summer to lead a movement to eliminate the practice, promoting baseless claims that mailed ballots are linked to widespread fraud. Some states are also reevaluating their mail-in voting laws, including shortening or ending grace periods that now require election officials to count mailed ballots that arrive after Election Day.
The U.S. Supreme Court in November agreed to take a case that could end ballot grace periods nationwide. A decision by the justices late next spring or early summer striking them down could affect 16 states and the District of Columbia, potentially upending the rules of elections as states prepare to hold primaries ahead of the November midterm elections that will determine control of Congress.
The midterm ballot measure battles have already begun

Mail-in voting surged in 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic, when 43% of voters cast their votes by mail. The percentage of voters mailing their ballots has fallen from that peak but remains above pre-pandemic levels. About 30% of voters cast mail ballots in 2024, according to data gathered by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.
That’s 46.8 million voters, underscoring the electoral and political stakes involved in any major change to mail-in voting.
“THE MAIL-IN BALLOT HOAX, USING VOTING MACHINES THAT ARE A COMPLETE AND TOTAL DISASTER, MUST END, NOW!!!” Trump posted in August on his social media site, Truth Social.
Trump promised in the post to issue an executive order that would bring “HONESTY” to the midterm elections, but none has been forthcoming. In response to questions, the White House referred Stateline back to the president’s post.
Robinson, the president of the Oregon Association of County Clerks, emphasized the security of mail-in ballots, but acknowledged that the message has become a “hard sell.”
“We’ve done everything in our power to try to squash the myths and disinformation that it’s wrought with fraud, because it is not,” he said.
Ballot deadlines targeted
Amid scrutiny of mail-in ballots, Ohio is on the verge of eliminating its ballot grace period, potentially becoming at least the fifth state to tighten ballot arrival deadlines this year, along with Kansas, Minnesota, North Dakota and Utah.
The Republican-controlled Ohio legislature last month passed a bill that would require all ballots to be returned to election officials by the close of polls on Election Day to count, with exceptions for late-arriving military and overseas ballots. Under current law, the ballots must arrive by the fourth day after the election.
Ohio Republican Secretary of State Frank LaRose spearheaded the push for the change. He has argued that setting an Election Day deadline for the arrival of mailed ballots will minimize voter confusion and that uncertainty surrounding late-arriving ballots in a close contest risks damaging voter confidence.
LaRose has also suggested the U.S. Department of Justice would sue Ohio if it didn’t change its deadline.
GOP backs voting by mail, yet turns to courts to restrict it in battleground states

During a legislative hearing in late October, LaRose told lawmakers that Assistant U.S. Attorney General Harmeet Dhillon, who leads the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, wrote in a Sept. 29 letter to Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost that Ohio should take immediate action to comply with federal law and “avoid costly litigation” in federal court.
“They identified what they consider to be a conflict between state and federal law as to the deadline for which absentee ballots must be returned by mail,” LaRose testified
The Justice Department indicated that Ohio law should match that of other states that require ballots to be returned by the close of polls on Election Day, LaRose said. He added that he asked for the opportunity to work with lawmakers to change the law in lieu of a lawsuit.
LaRose’s office didn’t respond to Stateline’s interview request. The Justice Department and Yost didn’t respond to requests for comment and for a copy of the September letter.
Ohio Republican Gov. Mike DeWine hasn’t said whether he will sign or veto the bill eliminating the grace period. A spokesperson for the governor said Monday that DeWine hadn’t yet received it.
During the 2024 election in Ohio, 8,335 mail ballots weren’t counted, or 0.8% of all mail ballots returned to election officials, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Nationwide, 584,463 mail ballots weren’t counted, 1.2% of those returned.
Nearly 18% of rejected mail ballots were rejected because they weren’t received on time, according to the commission’s data.
Debra Shankland, a 66-year-old Democrat in the Cleveland suburb of Brecksville, said she’s worked to register voters in public housing and other apartment buildings, giving her experience talking with people about voting by mail. Many people like mail ballots, she said, but want to drop them off instead of mailing them.
Shankland, who submitted written testimony to the state legislature opposing the elimination of Ohio’s grace period, wrote that she votes absentee because she’s a poll worker and therefore unavailable on Election Day. Instead, she places her ballot in a drop box (Ohio law limits drop boxes to one per county).
“I do know a lot of people are very leery of the mail and I am, too,” Shankland said in an interview, adding that she’s had mail stolen in the past.
The United States Postal Service has battled declining performance for years. Ahead of the 2020 election, then-Postmaster General Louis DeJoy rolled out a series of changes to mail service, including the removal of some mail-sorting machines and cuts to the number of the service’s ubiquitous blue public mailboxes. Amid criticism, DeJoy backed off the changes a few months before the election; he resigned earlier this year.
During peak mail season last year — Thanksgiving through New Year’s Eve — USPS missed five of six service performance targets, despite lowering the targets, according to a USPS Office of Inspector General report released in July.
But the postal service has touted its efforts to ensure rapid delivery of election mail, including ballots, during the 2024 election. USPS has said it delivered 99.88% of ballots to election officials within seven days, and 97.73% of ballots within three days. A USPS Office of Inspector General report from April found that the postal service “significantly exceeded service performance goals” for election mail and most political mail.
USPS has previously noted that election laws and procedures vary among the 50 states and the nearly 8,000 election jurisdictions in the country. “This can result in a mismatch of timeframes, deadlines, ballot return suggestions and the practical reality of using the mail,” the postal service said in a November 2024 report.
Supreme Court case looms
The U.S. Supreme Court may soon set a nationwide mail ballot arrival deadline.
The court will consider a dispute between the Republican National Committee and Mississippi, which requires mailed ballots to be counted if they are received within five business days of the election and are postmarked on or before Election Day. Postmarks act as a check against fraud, helping to ensure that ballots were placed in the mail before the end of the election — and not afterward in an attempt to alter the outcome.
The case cuts across partisan lines. Mississippi Secretary of State Michael Watson, a Republican who is defending the law, declined to comment, citing pending litigation. But in September, Watson told the Mississippi newspaper The Dispatch that “the policy decision should be made at the state level.”
At the core of the case is a question of whether a longstanding federal law that sets the Tuesday after the first Monday in November as Election Day for federal offices, preempts state laws that allow ballots cast by Election Day, but received later, to count.
And at the same time, the case asks: What does it mean to cast a ballot? Is putting it in the mail enough, or does it need to reach election officials?
The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in October 2024 that the law requires ballots to be received by Election Day. Trump likewise issued an executive order in March that attempted to require that mail ballots be received by the end of Election Day and to impose other election changes, but much of the order has been blocked by federal courts.
Deep red Utah wants to keep voting by mail

Caleb Hays, chief policy counsel at the Center for Election Confidence, a conservative-leaning legal advocacy group that opposes ballot grace periods, said Congress has the authority to set the date of congressional and presidential elections and had spoken. The center has filed court papers urging the Supreme Court to strike down the Mississippi law.
A requirement that all ballots must be received by the close of polls sets a “bright line rule” for election officials and voters, Hays said, making sure everyone has the same expectation about when ballots must be in.
“In this case, Election Day means Election Day,” Hays said.
In West Virginia, less than 3% of voters cast their ballots by mail in the 2024 election, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Only 247 mail ballots weren’t counted — 1.1% of the mail ballots received by election officials.
Still, West Virginia Republican Secretary of State Kris Warner said mail ballot arrival deadlines should be left to the states. In his state, ballots postmarked on or before Election Day must be received before the start of the canvass. He said the grace period is “working just fine the way it is right now.”
Warner said he would follow the law as interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court but warned Trump against attempting to unilaterally change election procedures in West Virginia, where the president enjoyed a nearly 41% margin of victory in 2024.
“You know, across the bottom of my state flag is ‘Montani Semper Liberi’ and Mountaineers are always free and they’re not going to take kindly to an executive order by the president changing how we’re going to do our elections,” Warner said.
Back in Oregon, Robinson, the Harney County clerk, said he personally wouldn’t mind if the grace period goes away. Oregon currently counts ballots received within seven days of the election if they were postmarked by Election Day. More and more ballots are arriving during the grace period, he said.
“But we do what we’re told and follow the Constitution,” Robinson said.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)With health insurance costs poised to spike for more than a half-million Ohioans, U.S. Sen. Jon Husted offered a compromise. It consists mostly of raising costs or cutting benefits for low and middle-income consumers whose pay and insurance plans aren’t as good as his own.
The 43-day government shutdown that ended Nov. 13 was primarily over subsidies created in 2021 to help people purchase health insurance on exchanges created by the Affordable Care Act. 
They’re set to expire in less than three weeks, which would cause premiums to more than double on average for nearly 600,000 Ohioans and 23 million Americans.
With the country mired in an affordability crisis, large majorities of Americans want to see the subsidies extended. 
Congressional Democrats refused to sign on to a spending bill reopening the government unless Republicans agreed to such an extension.
The impasse was broken when a small group of Democrats in the Senate agreed to support a spending bill in exchange for a promise from Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D. He said he would bring an extension to a vote before the subsidies expire. 
A vote on a three-year extension is expected this week. But it’s likely to fail amid Republican opposition.
That leaves the GOP with a political imperative to come up with an alternative. 
On Nov. 20, Husted took to the Senate floor to offer his.
Formerly Ohio’s lieutenant governor, he was appointed to fill the seat vacated by JD Vance when Vance assumed the vice presidency in January. 
Husted has to run for his Senate seat next November, and affordable health care is likely to be a big issue.
Husted has been highly critical of the ACA subsidies, which are credited with helping to bring down the rate of uninsured Americans to an all-time low. He voted repeatedly against extending them.
In his Nov. 20 floor speech, Husted called them, “Another $350 billion on the national credit card for a program that we know is dysfunctional.” 
He was citing the estimated cost over 10 years if the insurance subsidies are made permanent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
Husted’s office didn’t respond last week when asked why he was against extending that program as is, while he was OK with voting last summer for President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

That law extended the 2017 Trump tax cuts, providing a $1 trillion windfall to the richest 1% of Americans over the coming decade. It also cut nearly $1 trillion from Medicaid, the federal health program for the poor, and another $186 billion in federal food assistance.
Even though it slashes programs for the needy, the law Husted voted for still adds $3.4 trillion to the deficit, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.
About 64% of Americans now view the Affordable Care Act — or Obamacare — favorably. But as with many Republican officials, Husted still doesn’t like it.
“I wasn’t here when Congress passed Obamacare or the Biden covid subsidies that have been used to prop up the ACA exchanges, but I want to be part of the solution,” he said. “Didn’t create the problem, but I’m here to be part of the solution.” 
To do so, he proposed a “fraud, freeze and fix approach.” 
Most pertinent to Ohioans who get their insurance on the ACA exchanges is the “freeze” portion of the formula.
“We need to freeze the subsidies to where they are right now, so it doesn’t become a growing burden for the American taxpayer,” Husted said.
The freeze would fall on people using the exchanges. They would either see their costs go up with health-sector inflation, or some would be locked out of the program. 
The subsidies in 2024 saved the average recipient about $700 a year, but savings can be nearly $20,000 for some households. 
If the ACA subsidies are allowed to expire, marketplace recipients will lose those savings. 
That would create large numbers of uninsured people who would still get sick, but couldn’t pay for their care — a matter Husted didn’t discuss. 
Taking away insurance from an estimated 4 million Americans, the Trump law Husted supported is expected to force health care costs even higher, the University of California at Berkeley reported in July.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
If subsidies are frozen as Husted proposes, marketplace participants will also lose, just not as much.
According to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, the cost of the subsidies has risen from about $92 billion in 2023 to an estimated $138 billion this year.
 At the same time, enrollment has grown from 16 million Americans to an estimated 23 million over the same period.
In other words the patient base has grown about 44% since 2023, while costs have grown about 50%. 
Freezing the amount spent on the program would require some mix of reducing eligibility and increasing participants’ costs.
As for the “fraud” piece of his proposal, Husted cited pandemic-era abuses in which brokers fraudulently enrolled people or changed their coverage without their permission. 
His solution is to make people using the “Bronze”  — or lowest — tier of coverage with no premiums to pay at least a token amount. 
“Requiring everyone receiving a premium tax credit to pay a small amount — at least a small amount — toward their health care insurance will help realign the incentives and reduce fraud,” he said. 
“It will make certain that Americans cannot be enrolled in plans without their knowledge and consent.” 
However, he didn’t note that those plans carry high deductibles and often coinsurance, which requires patients to pay a percentage of the cost of treatment. 
So people using bronze plans usually end up paying more for care than others on the ACA exchanges.
In addition, the Commonwealth Fund reported, safeguards implemented last year appear to be helping to solve the problem with fraud.
“Following implementation of this safeguard, broker-initiated plan changes dropped nearly 70% and changes that redirect a commission from a consumer’s original broker to a new one — an indicator of potential misconduct — fell almost 90%,” it said. 
Husted also complained about costs associated with the marketplace’s midlevel, or “Silver” plan. 
The way the subsidies work, people with the least money are incentivized to participate in those plans. 
Overall, nearly 60% of people using the ACA exchanges buy Silver plans.
Husted called the incentives “Silver loading” and charged that it improperly inflates expenses.
“It supercharged the federal subsidy spending,” he said. “It created a system that got gamed.”  
But is it fair to imply that it’s somehow a scam to encourage people to use plans that cover 70% of “actuarial value” — the amount of medical expenses a person is likely to have? 
The bronze plans cover just 60% of actuarial value and, if they include coinsurance, can expose people to catastrophic expenses.
Meanwhile, according to Physicians for a National Health Program, Husted and his colleagues enjoy much better plans, compliments of the taxpayers. 
Physicians and Students for a National Health Program is a group of 20,000 doctors and medical students who advocate for a single-payer system such as those in other developed countries. 
They pay far less per person for health care and have far better outcomes.
It said congressional plans cover 80% of actuarial value, while “the 60% to 70% actuarial value plans for the general public (on the ACA exchanges) are considered to be underinsurance — plans that do not provide adequate financial security in the face of medical need.”
There’s also the issue of relative income. As a senator, Husted makes $175,000 a year. 
About 70% of the people using the ACA exchanges make 250% or less of federal poverty guidelines. 
For a family of four, that’s $80,375 a year, or a little more than half of what Husted makes. 
Husted did advocate three reforms that have considerable support in health policy circles:

Price transparency so patients and health plans can be informed shoppers
Reform of the opaque practices of middlemen known as pharmacy benefit managers, or PBMs. The biggest three are owned by giant health conglomerates and control nearly 80% of the marketplace. They’re suspected of driving up drug prices through anticompetitive practices.
Reform of the 340B program. Designed to subsidize care for the poor, the cost has exploded. And a lack of regulations has allowed hospitals to draw funds even as they use  of that money to pay lavish salaries and buy things like stadium-naming rights.

“It will drive down the actual cost of health care,” Husted said of the reforms.

Last month, the Department of Social Services requested roughly $938 million from the federal government for the effort. The funding would come from the Rural Health Transformation Program — created as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, or H.R. 1, that President Donald Trump signed into law in July.
Connecticut’s sprawling plan includes 31 different initiatives focused on increasing care options in rural areas and facilitating access to that care, Kyle Kramer, CEO of Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, said. Day Kimball, one of Connecticut’s four rural hospitals, is currently independent, but working through the details of an acquisition by UConn Health, the state’s flagship medical institution. 
“If we’re really focused on improving health, it starts with access,” Kramer, who worked closely with DSS to put together the state’s application, said. “Are there enough options and opportunities for people to get to care? And, if they exist, can they actually get to those locations from a transportation standpoint?”

The state’s pitch includes several programs aimed at strengthening the rural health care workforce, including provider incentives, residency grants, expanded training opportunities and implementing interstate licensure compacts. 
The plan includes initiatives meant to reduce or eliminate travel times for accessing care, like rolling out mobile medical and dental vans, as well as expanding telehealth options. There are also programs that seek to improve overall wellness: bringing evidence-based exercise classes to senior centers and making upgrades to existing trail systems. 
A handful of the proposed initiatives would require sign-off from state lawmakers, including streamlining the state’s “certificate of need” approval process for major hospital transactions — such as mergers, acquisitions, and unit closures — and seeking a SNAP waiver to bar the purchase of energy drinks and candy.
The $50 billion Rural Health Transformation Program fund was added to the legislation, known as OBBBA, amid concerns about how the bill’s Medicaid cuts would impact rural facilities. Mehmet Oz, the administrator for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services called the program “a spaceshot that will allow us to completely re-envision how rural health care is offered in this country.”
Half of the $50 billion grant will be evenly divided among all approved states. The other $25 billion will be based on the sole discretion of CMS and will take into account the rural makeup of states plus other factors “the administrator determines appropriate.”
A DSS spokesperson said the agency hopes to hear next month regarding the state’s application but won’t know until then how much funding Connecticut will get.
Rural health care has long faced a complex combination of challenges. People living in rural areas of the country are at higher risk for certain conditions, like fatal heart disease and stroke. At the same time, serving small populations makes it difficult for these facilities to generate scale and recruit doctors, nurses and hospital staff.
Connecticut’s rural hospitals are all underperforming financially when compared to the state’s hospitals overall. Rural residents face a median drive time of 32 minutes to a trauma center and 26 minutes to a stroke center, according to the state’s application. Since 2023, the state has approved the closure of two of its four rural maternity units — at Johnson Memorial and Windham Hospitals.
Even with a $50 billion funding opportunity, providers around the country are expressing concern about the impact of anticipated Medicaid changes in H.R. 1. Nonprofit research organization KFF estimates the law will result in a $137 billion hit to Medicaid funding in rural areas over 10 years — “about $87 billion more than is appropriated for the rural health fund,” researchers note.
“For rural hospital systems that are already facing strain or operating on thin margins, there’s been a really widespread concern that decreased revenue and increasing costs related to uncompensated care will put additional pressure on those health systems,” Katie Greene, director of population and public health at the National Academy for State Health Policy, said. 
A spokesperson for the federal Department of Health and Human Services referred to comments by Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, who said the Rural Health Transformation Program would increase health funding to rural Americans by 50%.
“To put it in perspective, about 7% of Medicaid dollars go to rural health care. That’s about $19 billion a year. This fund is $10 billion a year for 5 years. So [that’s] a 50% increase in the amount of money that Medicaid will pay into rural health care,” Oz said during a September Senate Republican leadership press conference. 
Multiple health policy researchers have called Oz’s assertion misleading.
Paul Kidwell, senior vice president of policy at the Connecticut Hospital Association, called the Rural Health Transformation Program “a positive measure” to address rural health challenges, but added that “it will not do enough to make up for the harmful impacts” of H.R. 1.
“Nearly $1 trillion in Medicaid cuts will cause significant harm to healthcare access and affordability in every state and strain the nation’s entire healthcare delivery system hurting hospitals and patients in every community, including rural communities, all the same,” Kidwell wrote in emailed comments.
Day Kimball CEO Kramer said the Medicaid cuts keep him up at night. But, he’s still excited about the opportunity the program presents to reassess how they deliver health care in their rural community and address health needs before they become emergencies.
“The American health care system is one of the absolute best in the world at treating patients with complex diseases. We earn that reputation for treating people once they’ve gotten to the point where they have these very serious illnesses,” Kramer said. “[What] if we flip the script a bit and start to think about ‘What could we do to potentially prevent some of that risk?’”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/20220608_DayKimball_Putnam_YK_030.jpg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)In 1996, Matt Dunlap was a soon-to-be married bar manager at Pat’s Pizza in Orono and doubled as a proofreader at the University of Maine print shop. It was the first year his salary crested $30,000.
That same year, Dunlap, a Democrat, made a successful run for the Maine Legislature. After finding out he won, he remembers feeling terrified because his new gig would mean a pay cut. 
“How the hell am I going to pay the bills?” Dunlap wondered at the time.
Twenty years later, Dunlap told Maine Morning Star in an interview that he is running for national office because he wants to help the people in his community who tell him they are buckling under rising costs and frustrated with the status quo that is not doing enough to address them. This desire to help working families, as well as his ability to listen to people, is what the residents of Maine’s 2nd Congressional District need in their next representative to the U.S. House of Representatives.
For those reasons, the Old Town resident has gained the support of many prominent 2nd District Democrats, who say he’s earned the trust of his neighbors and would work with anyone — regardless of party — who wants to help Maine people. However, with the primary still more than six months away, the national party says it is still searching for the right candidate because they aren’t convinced Dunlap is it.
In early November, U.S. Rep. Jared Golden, who has held the seat for the last eight years, announced he would not seek re-election. His decision was attributed to increased incivility and political violence that made him reassess the risk for him and his family. 
Golden won’t seek reelection in 2026

His departure created an open race for one of the most hotly contested U.S. House seats in the country. In the 2nd District, which comprises the geographic majority of the state north of Augusta, voters have routinely split tickets, reelecting Golden while backing President Donald Trump each time he has run for president. 
But Dunlap, who announced his run in early October, decided to run even before he knew Golden was out. It was a decision that former state lawmaker Thom Harnett said deserves respect and recognition. To him, it shows Dunlap is running because he believes he’s the best person for the job. 
Harnett, who lives in Gardiner, endorsed Dunlap before Golden dropped out.
Betsy Sweet, who has been an advocate in the state for more than 40 years, said Mainers know their neighbors and are equipped to decide who is best to represent them in Congress. Like Harnett, she thinks Dunlap is that person for the 2nd District. 
She praised Dunlap for having “a true north,” which she compared to criticism from Republicans and some Democrats that Golden would too frequently change his mind on policies. 
Beyond his years as a state lawmaker, Sweet said Dunlap has proven himself politically with multiple terms as secretary of state and now serving as state auditor.
But as of early last week, a source familiar with Democratic recruiting efforts said the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee continues to look for the “strongest possible” candidate to represent Maine. They said they want “someone who truly reflects the district and will fight every day for the people who call it home.”
Likewise, Golden doesn’t see Dunlap as his appropriate successor. When announcing his decision not to run, Golden said he hoped his exit would clear the way for competitive primaries for both parties, arguing that Dunlap and presumptive Republican candidate Paul LePage are “a far cry from being standard bearers of the generations that will inherit the legacy of today’s Congress.”
Prior to that, when the two seemed to be headed for a primary, Golden also called Dunlap a “30-year party crony” and doubted the district, which leans conservative, would choose him over LePage, the former two-term governor. 
Throughout his time in Congress, Golden was frequently ranked as one of the most centrist Democrats and many believe his willingness to break from the party is what helped win him support among CD2 voters.
Last summer, Golden’s campaign released an internal poll showing the congressman leading LePage by a single point in a hypothetical matchup; the same survey shows Dunlap trailing by 10 points, according to reporting from NOTUS.  
Since Golden dropped out, more contenders have entered the race, including Jordan Wood who pivoted his Democratic bid to unseat U.S. Sen. Susan Collins and Republican political newcomer James Clark. 
National Dems criticized for being out of touch
The chorus of Dunlap supporters would tell you that the national skepticism over his candidacy comes from a lack of understanding what Mainers in the 2nd District value and what concerns they have. 
Maine Rep. Laura Supica (D-Bangor) said she believes national Democrats have come to rely on money in politics to win, which leaves them out of touch with the values and voters who actually live there. 
Supica, who also works as a barista, said she isn’t sure how she will pay her heating oil bill every month this winter. She knows others in the 2nd District who can buy groceries in the summer months, but rely on food banks when it gets cold because they can’t swing the cost of both food and heat. 
That struggle, she said, Dunlap understands, which is partly why she is co-chairing the Women for Dunlap coalition. At a news conference with the coalition Monday, Supica highlighted Dunlap’s promise to help working families by fighting for an expanded child tax credit and universal childcare. 
Harnett also rejects the idea that Democrats outside of Maine need to pick the candidate. As he sees it, that is the purpose of the primary election: for Maine voters to decide who they think is the most appropriate candidate.
Harnett and Sweet also both pointed out that the national party often gets it wrong in Maine.
“We have seen in prior races that the candidates anointed in Washington D.C. don’t necessarily do very well with Maine voters and that’s because Maine voters know what they care about and the issues that are important to them,” Harnett said.










We have seen in prior races that the candidates anointed in Washington D.C. don’t necessarily do very well with Maine voters and that’s because Maine voters know what they care about and the issues that are important to them.


– Thom Harnett


Dunlap similarly pointed to the national party’s failed attempt to have former Democratic Speaker of the Maine House of Representatives Sara Gideon challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Susan Collins in 2020. He said the Freeport resident was not well positioned to run statewide but picked for her ability to raise money. 
“They thought all you need to do is raise money and you can beat Susan Collins because people in Napa Valley hate Susan Collins. Well, you know, St. John Valley, not so much,” he said.
On Monday, Dunlap’s campaign said it isn’t releasing specific information about how much money has been raised until the next quarterly filing deadline with the Federal Election Commission, which is in late January, but said that they are positioned to be competitive. 
Meanwhile, Wood has raised $4 million since April, which includes his time as a Senate candidate, according to a news release from his campaign last week. Additionally, filings with the Federal Elections Commission show Golden having raised $2.3 million before exiting the race and LePage bringing in a little more than $900,000.
As secretary of state, Dunlap made a national name for himself by serving on Trump’s voter fraud commission during the president’s first term and refusing to hand over sensitive Maine voter information that the commission requested.",https://mainemorningstar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7439-scaled-e1765227378619-1024x682.jpeg,,,2025-12-09 05:58:23.819005

(Photo by Megan Varner/Getty Images)A new multi-state coalition is pushing for federal funding and support for Ohio and other Appalachian states as major flooding events increase in the region.
The Appalachian Flood Resilience Coalition spent its first meeting dissecting the federal battles to fund the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the future of flood-related advocacy.
Brendan Muckian-Bates, policy and advocacy associate with the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center, said the coalition began forming after the July 2022 floods that hit eastern Kentucky and southwestern Virginia. The group united around “resiliency in Appalachia and understanding that these hundred-year, thousand-year flooding events were becoming more common.”
“They were becoming more frequent, deadlier, and the communities where we live and work were really underprepared for the increased devastation that we were witnessing first-hand,” Muckian-Bates said.
  Tracking flooding events 
Natalie Kruse Daniels, professor at Ohio University and director of the environmental studies program, presented a new project on the importance of collecting data through stream gages in Appalachia to help predict future disasters. Stream gages are devices that study water conditions and river flow. Being able to predict and study floods can not only help with disaster cleanup and mitigation, but also the factors that come along with floods, like infrastructure damage and “social vulnerability.”
“Personally … finding good data is one of the biggest challenges when we’re looking at how we practically work on flood damages,” Daniels said.
According to the study conducted by Daniels and Chloe Partlow, rural areas that have a lack of local funding and population density have fewer stream gages to gather data the researchers said is “essential for flood modeling, prediction and warnings.”

The U.S. Geological Survey, which operates more than 11,000 stream gages across the country, is underfunded, hampering its ability to collect more data, the research stated. That struggle comes amid more and more flood events in Appalachia.
“The Central Appalachian region has seen repeated severe flood events that have led to federal disaster declarations and activated FEMA response,” according to Daniels and Partlow’s research.
In some places, up to 16 disasters have been declared between 2011 and 2024.
The attendees of the coalition’s first meeting, which included advocates and regional representatives, were asked what they would fix about natural disaster response and recovery if they had a magic wand. Overwhelmingly, the votes went to funding and communication, along with collaboration and development in the floodplain.
The group was also asked what they wish policymakers knew about flooding in Appalachia, and proactive action rather than a focus on clean up came up several times, along with acknowledgment of how susceptible Appalachian communities are to major flooding.
“Eventually it can affect you, and I think that’s something that does get lost for policymakers,” Muckian-Bates said.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe law center is working on a project to record the “lessons learned” from Hurricane Helene. In talking with affected communities, Erin Savage, Central Appalachian program manager for the law center, said it was clear that anticipation and intensity of flooding events were becoming more and more challenging, and the enormity of the events is adding to the problems.
“(Hurricane Helene) occurred over such a huge area that there was just a lot of confusion,” Savage said. “Usually counties would be able to assist each other, maybe if one county wasn’t hit so bad it could help a neighboring county, but it was so widespread that there was just no extra capacity.”
  Where’s the funding? 
Appalachian regions are hoping disaster support at the federal level will start improving, but they are cautiously optimistic about the possibilities coming in the next appropriations bill, along with separate efforts currently sitting in Congress.
Federal appropriations related to flooding support for fiscal year 2026 “did not experience the really drastic cuts proposed by the President’s budget request from earlier in the spring,” according to Jessica Arriens, of the National Wildlife Federation. She also said $500,000 appeared in the newest House appropriation proposal for the Appalachian Regional Reforestation Initiative. The federation had requested $5 million in congressional outreach efforts.
“Certainly a lot lower than our request, but if that does pass, it would be the first time that (the initiative) ever got federal funding, so we’d love to see it higher because that program’s really impactful, but we’ll certainly take what we can get,” Arriens said.
Appropriations are unfortunately still imaginary money until passed on Capitol Hill, and even then, convincing higher-ups in the Trump administration to release the money could be another challenge.
“It doesn’t necessarily matter how much gets appropriated if President Trump and cabinet secretaries won’t allow federal agencies like FEMA to spend the money that’s appropriated,” Arriens said.
FEMA has already seen funding get blocked by Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem, to the tune of more than $100,000, according to Kevin Zedak, government affairs specialist for Appalachian Voices.
“We’ve seen this impacting community projects directly, holding up that funding from approval,” Zedak said. “So this has been a big hurdle in communities accessing that funding, whether it’s hazard mitigation assistance that was previously distributed, or public assistance.”
Grants from the federal Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program saw $882 million rescinded by FEMA leaders as well, Zedak said, but there are efforts in Congress to “reinstall” that program.
With FEMA reducing their staff by about one-third, and hazard mitigation funding not being consistently awarded after a disaster, the state of Appalachian recovery from flooding and other natural occurrences could become tenuous.
Federal efforts to help the situation exist, but are sitting on a shelf awaiting congressional action.
New legislation was introduced to simplify the process of accessing assistance and create a universal disaster assistance application passed a House committee in September. The bill would also increase transparency on decisions regarding assistance eligibility, according to Rebecca Shelton, director of policy for the Appalachian Citizens’ Law Center.
“(In applying for FEMA assistance) there’s often multiple rounds of rejections from FEMA and appeals from households, and it’s a long and drawn out and challenging, and it’s not very transparent,” Shelton said.
The bill would help bring clarity to the process and transition the public assistance funding model from a reimbursement process to a grant model, something Shelton said advocates support.
While the Chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee expressed confidence in the bill, “currently there’s not a clear vehicle in the House, there’s not yet a companion bill in the Senate, and President Trump is not indicating any support for the bill,” Shelton said.
There’s also a provision in the “ROAD to Housing Act,” passed in a Senate committee in October, that would permanently authorize grants for disaster recovery. Though the provision made it into an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act in the Senate, the provision wasn’t included in the House’s version, leaving the fate of the provision in limbo.
So, the path forward isn’t clear, but Shelton said the remedy is “continued support and advocacy from stakeholders in Appalachia and across the country.”

When the olive green charter bus pulled into the suburban civic center in a conservative area east of Cincinnati just after 9 p.m. on Friday, the women were ready.
They loaded duffels and coolers and bags of snacks into the bus. They carried handmade “Impeach, Convict, Remove” signs, transgender pride flags, and the red hooded cloaks and white bonnets made famous by “The Handmaid’s Tale,” the dystopian feminist novel adapted into a popular Hulu series.
Cincinnati was the first of three stops in a “turn and burn” trip from Ohio to the nation’s capital for a “Remove the Regime” protest — and it didn’t follow the most logical route. Stops in suburbs outside Columbus and Cleveland added hours to the drive. The women didn’t seem to care.
The passengers piled into the dark bus — a dozen or so in Cincinnati, 14 near Columbus, 20 on the outskirts of Cleveland. Some of the women brought along friends, a few came with their spouses and others traveled on their own. There were brief introductions among seatmates as each new group boarded and everyone settled in; a couple of them built blanket tents to block the cold air that seeped in and the lights from cars passing the bus on the highway.
They would need all the rest they could get. This protest trip would involve two overnight bus trips in 36 hours and just 12 hours on the ground.
For people like Judy Routhier, who boarded in Cleveland, the trip to Washington was the latest in a string of public efforts to oppose the Trump administration. This mother of four married to a military veteran said it was her 72nd protest since February. She brought laminated signs that read, “Hump-y Trump-y Must Fall! He’s on the Epstein List” and “This ‘Piggy’ Won’t be Quiet! IMPEACH. CONVICT. REMOVE.”
Deann Ragsdale, who boarded in Cincinnati, was embarking on her first public action despite her opposition to just about every facet of Republican Donald Trump’s presidency from its start. The longtime labor-and-delivery nurse and mother of three teenagers — one of them transgender — keeps a grueling hospital schedule. The protest happened to fall on a weekend off. “Something has to change, and we have to start somewhere,” she said.
Like at many events opposing Trump and his administration, the majority of the bus passengers were women, though a couple who spoke to The 19th noted that men are increasingly joining them in their local protest efforts. The women said they were spurred into action by the administration’s moves to restrict reproductive rights, its attacks on the rights of LGBTQ+ people, its hostility to immigrants and its disregard for the rule of law.
The “Remove the Regime” event was organized by member organizations of the Removal Coalition, a grassroots effort just like the Ohio bus trip. The trip had come together just days earlier, when a woman from Florida raised more than $30,000 through crowdfunding to “find affordable buses and coordinate seats so that no one is left behind just because they can’t pay for a ticket.” Someone else created a “Get to DC” page on Facebook to connect travelers. There were also local events in places like Charleston, South Carolina, and Fairmont, West Virginia, for those who could not make it to Washington.

When the bus pulled into Union Station, near the Capitol building, just before 9 a.m. on Saturday, Jen Mazzuckelli, who acted as point person for the Cincinnati group, changed into her Handmaid cloak and headed to the Lincoln Memorial. Like many on the bus and at the larger protest, Mazzuckelli is involved with a grassroots political movement known as 50501 — as in 50 protests, 50 states, one movement.
“If somebody says ‘50501,’ you know they’re in the fight, you know they’re in the resistance,”  Mazzuckelli, 52, said. “I feel like we’re in Star Wars.”
Mazzuckelli, a mother of three who extracted herself from an abusive marriage, knows on a personal level how looming Republican cuts to social safety net programs like Medicaid health insurance and SNAP nutrition assistance might impact her exurban Ohio community. After her divorce, she said she relied on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, which provided cash assistance for necessities until she started receiving child support. She currently receives disability benefits due to a multiple sclerosis diagnosis. She spends more and more of her time protesting the Trump administration and is weighing another run for office after an unsuccessful bid last year for her county’s GOP-dominated board of commissioners. For now, she tries to be a thorn in their side, showing up to meetings.
As Mazzuckelli and other women dressed like Handmaids sat on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial alongside a massive copy of the U.S. Constitution, she thought to herself: “This will probably end up in history books, if we have real history books … It’s a historical moment, and I’m glad I was able to be a part of it instead of watching it on TV.”
“Remove the Regime” was a three-day action that included lobbying, trainings, an event honoring the military and its veterans, then the rally and a march. There were music performances from the Dropkick Murphys, among others, and a sold-out “Comedy Church” fundraiser with a set from North Carolina’s Cliff Cash, who is known for humor skewering Southern conservatism. Cash was one of the first to join the Removal Coalition, founded by Jessica Denson, a former staffer on Trump’s 2016 campaign who brought a class-action lawsuit over its use of nondisclosure agreements. Rep. Al Green, a Texas progressive, spoke at the rally, as did House of Representatives contender Kat Abughazaleh from Illinois.

The protest events came after a particularly tumultuous week for Trump that highlighted his past treatment of and continued hostile rhetoric directed at women. After months of delay tactics on behalf of GOP leaders, Congress voted on Tuesday to compel the Justice Department to release its files on disgraced financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Trump snapped, “Quiet! Quiet, piggy,” at a female Bloomberg News reporter who asked about releasing the Epstein files aboard Air Force One. But then he reversed course, writing on his social media platform, Truth Social: “I DON’T CARE! All I do care about is that Republicans get BACK ON POINT.”
Epstein references abounded on signs at the rally; Routhier, who was also wearing a fuzzy pig hat, was one of hundreds who had worked Trump’s exchange with the reporter into their protest gear. A woman from Northern Virginia carried a “Quiet, Piggy, lil’ fascist piggy” sign. A woman in a Trump mask with pig ears and a snout held a sign that urged “IMPEACH the Piggy!!” as she stood next to her Air Force veteran husband. At least a half dozen protesters were dressed up as Miss Piggy from The Muppet Show.
It wasn’t the largest event opposing Trump, but it was meaningful for those in attendance.
Amber Curry, a 36-year-old from Georgia, said the president’s treatment of women was a big factor in drawing her to Washington for her first-ever protest. Her husband is a disabled veteran and her family of six relies on programs like SNAP — which disproportionately serves women, children and older and disabled Americans — to feed themselves and make ends meet. Their benefits, disrupted during the record-breaking government shutdown that ended earlier this month, still aren’t back to normal. Curry warned that she might cry when talking about her reasons for attending the protest. “It’s so beautiful, people here are listening, because no one around me listens,” she said.
After the speakers and musical performances wrapped, the Miss Piggies and the inflatable eagles, polar bears, frogs, sharks, foxes and at least one Cookie Monster lined up behind the Handmaids and began to march. When Marine Force One flew directly overhead as Trump returned to the White House from an aerial tour with Jack Nicklaus of a planned golf course near Joint Base Andrews, fists and middle fingers rose into the air.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
At the end of the day, the women from Ohio made their way back to Union Station, convening in the basement food court to wait for the bus. They rolled up their signs ahead of the journey back to America’s Heartland. There was a buzz of excitement as they shared their experiences.
Erin Nezi, 45, said she was initially drawn to protest the Trump administration because she “felt a camaraderie with all of these women,” referring to the Handmaids, who had by then changed out of their cloaks. Nezi’s first local protest was in February; in recent weeks, she’d begun making trips to the nation’s capital. She is part of a group of women trying to build a Handmaid “army” in rural and exurban southern Ohio.
Nezi is currently unemployed after spending years on an assembly line building steering wheels for Ford vehicles. Her husband is a fully disabled Navy veteran dependent on benefits from Veterans Affairs. She said she is protesting for him — and also for other women like her, for her LGBTQ+ family members, for immigrants in her community and for her 69-year-old mother, who relies on subsidized housing. A constant question that runs through her mind, she said, is, “When is it going to come for me?”
The women boarded just after 9 p.m. The bus made its way out of Washington, crossed Maryland and Pennsylvania, and then stopped in Cleveland, Columbus and finally Cincinnati as the sun rose over the horizon. They thanked the bus driver, also a woman. She thanked them for going to the protest.
Routhier said her 73rd protest is already planned.
Ragsdale is considering making a video to share about how she assembled her sturdy, reusable sign.
Mazzuckelli wants to pursue “deep organizing” in rural, conservative pockets of Ohio, perhaps in conjunction with the Working Families Party.
“My idea is to get a committed group here in Clermont [County] and start pushing eastward,” she said.

Data show that nearly half of the people born in the 1960s bought a home by 30. By the 1980s, that number sank to 35%. The average first-time buyer today is 40, the highest on record. The average repeat buyer’s age has climbed to 62, also the highest ever. 
As more people rent rather than buy, movements in Topeka and Wichita protecting renters from abusive landlords have become more important than ever.
Kevin Myles, former head of the Wichita branch NAACP, hosted a town hall Dec. 6 in Wichita where people shared their rental experiences. That information will populate a brief he’s preparing for city officials in January. 
“Wichita is in the midst of a serious housing affordability and stability crisis, where too many families are spending a disproportionate share of their income just to keep a roof overhead,” said Myles, founder and executive director of Community First. “According to city’s own Consolidated Plan, a large share of renter households spends more than 30%, and some are even spending more than 50% of their income on housing costs.” 
That, he said, combined with the recent rejection by the city council of proposals to create a landlord registry or ban discrimination based on source of income, leaves families and youths vulnerable to substandard housing, discrimination and retaliatory eviction. 
He said a strong, codified tenants bill of rights could help protect the dignity, health and stability of families in Wichita. It would guarantee that landlords can’t refuse deny applicants because of income supports.
Myles said these provisions can ensure that landlords with a history of violations are held accountable, and that rental homes meet basic standards, so children don’t live in unsafe conditions.
“In a city where some families already struggle under cost burdens and where renters often lack leverage, codifying these protections can mean the difference between a stable, nurturing home and a cycle of insecurity, eviction risk, and trauma,” Myles said. 
Anyone who ever has rented an apartment or house has a horror story about landlords keeping deposits for dust on windowsills or paint improvements. Landlords certainly also have tenant horror stories of their own, from having to rip up pet-stained carpet, repairing bowling-ball sized holes in walls, and mountains of debris that they have to collect and dump.
After years of renting out property, they would like to retain the right to choose renters that their experience tells them would make for good tenants and reject those more likely to pay late or to damage property.
A tenant’s bill of rights could make life easier for everyone, said Rep. Alexis Simmons, D-Topeka.
“An enforced tenant’s bill of rights protects both tenants and landlords by providing clear expectations, empowering everyone involved,” Simmons said. “The inherently unequal tenant-landlord relationship makes these ordinances particularly important.”
Kansas Legal Services includes resources on its website about tenant rights. 
“This webpage is dedicated to explaining the issues that Kansas tenants might face, as well as their legal rights before, during and after tenancy,” according to the site.
Simmons said the struggling economy may have shifted renter’s attention to mere affordability, but that ignores other important factors.
“Affordable housing means nothing if that housing is not also safe, reliable, and up to code,” she said. “We know from both the hard data and just common sense that tenants with lower incomes and fewer resources are subjected to exploitation and abuse by landlords at a greater rate than everyone else. This can also mean they don’t realize their landlords are breaking the law or know about the avenues through which they can seek remediation and accountability.”

(Photo by David DeWitt, Ohio Capital Journal.)We’re coming close to the point that I wouldn’t want my son to attend college in the United States.
Granted, he’s seven. We have 10 years to turn it around. It’s essential for the health of our nation that we do. 
College is a time when you should be able to think big thoughts and explore challenging ideas. 
As an English and government major, I took courses that may not have taught me how to code, but they did teach me how to think. 
I believe that’s worth fighting for, which is why I’ve joined a growing movement of alumni that are calling on our alma maters to stand strong against ascendant fascism and the Trump regime. 
To make a difference, we need to build a powerful coalition representing alumni from the Ivy Leagues, state schools, and community colleges. 
Because the assaults on academic freedom are well underway within state capitals and inside university administrations, few institutions will be spared. 
Lawmakers in 26 states have introduced more than 70 bills to censure state colleges and universities; 22 have become law in 16 states. 
In Ohio, lawmakers passed Senate Bill 1 to root out “woke ideology” at state colleges and universities. 
It ensures professors teach “both sides” of issues. It also contains provisions to weaken unions’ collective bargaining power. 
Funny how those two things often seem to go together, isn’t it?
It’s troubling to consider how this law would have affected my studies at Cleveland State University’s Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs where I received a Master of Public Administration. 
We grappled with redlining, segregation, broken windows policing, welfare reform, and many other difficult topics. 
What do these discussions look like under Senate Bill 1?
Meanwhile, one institution after another is giving in to Trump’s blackmail. 
Northwestern agreed to a $75 million payoff and Brown forked over $50 million. 
The University of Virginia and University of Pennsylvania made a host of concessions about student data and DEI to protect their federal research funding. 
Columbia University was the first to fall with a $200 million payoff to atone for allegations of antisemitism within student Gaza protests. 
Last month, my alma mater, Cornell University, agreed to pay the administration $60 million for similar reasons. 
It agreed to hand over student demographic data to prove admissions aren’t being made based on race. But based on my experience (and the data), it seems legacy students and those from wealthy families are the ones with the real advantage. 
Yet even before they gave Trump his kickback, Cornell discontinued cultural housing such as Ujamaa House for Black students. 
Last year, the administration started cracking down on campus dissent. 
They prohibit students from protesting during “business hours” or after 9 p.m. If a student is caught protesting outside that window, they can be temporarily suspended as they await investigations that may take as long as two semesters. 
Meanwhile, they still owe tuition and must pay back financial aid. 
That’s a costly proposition that seems especially designed to silence the very students most harmed by the Trump extortion deal: first-generation students who are most likely to be students of color or immigrants. 
Combine these developments with the eye-popping cost of college and Trump’s further dismantling of our already flawed student loan program and I return to my original statement: If my son decides to go to college, I’m not sure he should stick around here. 
Most alumni are busy working, raising families, enjoying retirement or panicking about the many other horrors President Trump is unleashing. 
Many of us have been slow to comprehend what has happened on the campuses that shaped us. I’m paying attention now, and closely following the work of Students for a Democratic Cornell, who are leading the charge to give students a voice in the disciplinary process. 
Students can vote for 36 hours starting December 12. 
Back at home, we’re getting organized. 
Groups like Crimson Courage, Stand Strong Brown, Longhorns for Liberty and Stand For Campus Freedom are coming together. 
Members of Cornell Courage recently sent a letter to President Michael Kotlikoff and the Board of Trustees calling on them to take measures to increase transparency and protect student privacy. 
Alumni like me are fighting back in part to protect the legacy of the institutions that we love. 
After all, many of us studied authoritarianism in college. 
We understand why Trump wants to destroy anyone or anything that encourages free thinking. 
For that reason, the fight is about much more than our colleges’ good name: it’s about our future.

Jeff Landry's administration has abruptly cut two contracts with private companies who provide Medicaid health care plans.  (Photo by Michelle Liu/Verite News)Gov. Jeff Landry’s administration is abruptly ending contracts with two of the six companies that provide Medicaid insurance in Louisiana, a move that could leave 488,500 residents uncertain of what health care they will have starting Jan. 1. 
Seth Gold, Louisiana’s Medicaid director, sent short letters last week to the CEOs of Aetna Better Health of Louisiana and UnitedHealthCare of Louisiana announcing their contract extensions with the state had been dropped for 2026. The Illuminator obtained copies of the letters Monday from the Louisiana Department of Health. 
“LDH will begin the transition process of moving your Medicaid members to other contracted Medicaid Managed Care Plans for a Jan. 1 effective date,” Gold wrote in the letters to the companies dated Dec. 2. 

The news came as a surprise to state lawmakers, who voted less than two weeks ago to extend the state’s agreements with both companies at the urging of the Landry administration. 

Attorney General Liz Murrill and other state officials said litigation over pharmacy benefit managers affiliated with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare were factors in stepping away from agreements with the companies. 
Spokespeople for the companies did not respond to requests for comment Monday evening. 
Aetna and UnitedHealthCare provide Medicaid insurance for 157,800 and 330,700 Louisiana residents, respectively, covering one-third of its 1.53 million enrollees.   
Aetna’s contract for the fiscal years 2026 and 2027  –  a time period which started July 1 and ends June 30, 2027 – is $2.59 billion. The UnitedHealthCare contract for the same time period is $2.06 billion, according to documents posted publicly in November. 
In an interview Monday night, Louisiana Health Secretary Bruce Greenstein said his department plans to move the enrollees with Aetna and UniteHealthCare coverage to new health plans before the end of the year. He’s confident the four other companies offering Medicaid plans will be able to handle the influx of new patients. 
AmeriHealth Caritas, Elevance Health, Humana and Louisiana Healthcare Connections are the other private companies who provide Medicaid plans in the state.

The health department is going to use an algorithm to help pick a plan for each person who needs to switch from Aetna or UnitedHealthCare, according to Greenstein. It will prioritize keeping families together with the same health care company and making sure the doctors and other medical professionals a person sees most frequently take their new insurance.

“This will take place over the next two weeks, so it will take place over Christmas,” Greenstein said. “I feel confident that we will be able to execute on this.” 

If a Medicaid recipient is unhappy with their new health care coverage, they will have 90 days starting Jan. 1 to switch into another plan, Greenstein said.

The state’s ongoing litigation with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare over their pharmacy benefit managers pushed the state to end their contracts with the companies, Greenstein and Murrill confirmed. 
In a text message Monday afternoon, Murrill said the companies “are not compliant with [state law] and until they are, they are ineligible for contract extensions.”

Pharmacy benefit managers are middlemen who negotiate prescription drug plans with insurers and drug manufacturers. Murrill and Landry have repeatedly criticized these entities, which are often owned by large health care corporations, of unfair business practices that undercut locally owned pharmacies. 
The attorney general was in Rome Monday preparing for a conference at the Vatican on human trafficking and said she was unavailable for a phone interview. In her text message responses, she did not identify which laws Aetna and UnitedHealthCare are allegedly breaking. 

“They are violating the contracts and have refused to provide us with [documents] we have requested,” the attorney general wrote. “United has engaged in frivolous attacks on the AGs contracting authority as well.” 

“They cannot expect to have a discretionary renewal when they are currently non-compliant,” Murrill said. 
She indicated the state is at more of an impasse with UnitedHealthCare than Aetna. Her office is in settlement discussions with CVS, which is Aetna’s parent company, she added.

In June, Murrill filed three lawsuits against CVS claiming its pharmacy benefit manager, CVS Caremark, operates in ways that discourage competition, particularly from the state’s independent pharmacists. 

She also alleged CVS inappropriately used customer information to launch a text message campaign to defeat state legislation that would have made it difficult for CVS Caremark to work in Louisiana. Landry, who is close to Murrill, was an enthusiastic supporter of the bill, which failed to pass. 
As attorney general in 2022, Landry launched a separate lawsuit against pharmacy benefit manager OptumRx and UnitedHealthCare, which are owned by the same parent company. He alleged they overcharged the state’s Medicaid plan for prescription drugs. 
In that case, which Murrill has since been taken over, the Louisiana First Circuit Court of Appeal recently sided with UnitedHealthCare over the state. 
The court’s ruling for UnitedHealthCare was released Nov. 21, the day after lawmakers signed off the company’s 2026 contract extension. A little over a week later, the health department appeared to reverse course and sent out a notice indicating they weren’t renewing the UnitedHealth agreement. 
The day before the court’s decision came out, the Landry administration had recommended to lawmakers that they allow the Aetna and UnitedHealthCare contractsto  go forward. 

During a nearly three-hour hearing, Greenstein and health department undersecretary Drew Maranto, both Landry appointees, answered dozens of questions from legislators and never expressed reservations about continuing to work with Aetna or UnitedHealthCare. 

Greenstein even pushed back when legislators suggested the state cut its number of Medicaid managed care contracts with private companies. Lawmakers believe working with fewer businesses could lower the administrative costs in the Medicaid program. But Greenstein cast doubt on whether those benefits would be worth the upheaval in the program. 
“Each of the plans brings a different way of envisioning how to engage patients with certain medical complexities,” Greenstein told legislators. “Patients don’t generally switch their health plan very often.”

His remarks are likely why several lawmakers, reached Monday, said they were blindsided when they discovered the health department had canceled the contract extensions. 
The governor and the health department didn’t give the legislators advance notice before they reversed course with Aetna and UnitedHealthCare.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Medicaid-navigators-1-1024x768.webp,,,2025-12-09 01:56:42.872523

(Tero Vesalainen/Getty Images)A fight between President Donald Trump and Gov. Ron DeSantis threatens to blow up Florida House Speaker Danny Perez’s planned “artificial intelligence week” in the Legislature, intended to set policy for the technology.
Although Perez, a Miami Republican, had planned for weeks to use Dec. 8-12 committee hearings to analyze the effects of AI in different Florida industries, the topic took on a national angle when Trump announced early Monday that he would sign an executive order creating a national rule preventing states from handing down their own regulations.
That put him in direct conflict with DeSantis, who’s long-railed against the dangers of AI and last week rolled out a proposal called the “Artificial Intelligence Bill of Rights.”
“There must be only One Rulebook if we are going to continue to lead in AI,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “I will be doing a ONE RULE Executive Order this week. You can’t expect a company to get 50 Approvals every time they want to do something.”
Hours later, DeSantis indirectly responded on X, asserting, “An executive order doesn’t/can’t preempt state legislative action. Congress could, theoretically, preempt states through legislation…I doubt Congress has the votes to pass this because it is so unpopular with the public.”
He referenced the U.S. House passing the “One Big Beautiful Bill” over the summer with a clause banning states from regulating AI for 10 years. The Senate voted 99-1 to strip that section out.
This is the latest — and most blatant — escalation in GOP politicos’ dispute over AI. DeSantis worries that unmonitored AI could usher in an age of “darkness and deceit” while Trump — allied with technology titans like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg — has for months toyed with banning state-level AI regulations.
This fiscal year alone, massive companies like Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft are expected to invest more than $364 billion in the industry. OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT, is pulling in roughly $13 billion in annual revenue while enjoying more than 800 million regular users.
And although the governor hopes lawmakers will crack down on AI data centers and “grooming” chatbots, and will protect consumer data from AI companies, a nationwide moratorium would severely limit the Legislature’s ability to do so.
Senate President Ben Albritton expressed support for the governor’s position but said he’ll wait and see what’s in Trump’s executive order before acting, he told reporters on Monday.
What can we expect this week?
The Florida House has scheduled 14 committee hearings from Tuesday through Thursday to discuss AI use in different facets of the Sunshine State’s industries.
It’s not clear whether the House meetings will lead to concrete proposals but multiple committees will weigh in on the repercussions of data centers on utility rates and use of artificial intelligence in emergency management, agriculture, education, health, criminal justice, and more.

 Housing First is the only approach proven to significantly reduce the number of people living on the streets, and it is actually more cost-effective than leaving people outside.   
Research shows that supportive housing dramatically lowers hospitalizations, emergency room use, psychiatric crises, and shelter stays, which creates net savings for taxpayers. It is the humane approach and the financially responsible one.
With the exception of promising a pilot program for portable showers and laundry services, Connecticut’s new housing bill (HB 8002) offers nothing to the 500+  people sleeping outside tonight. These are people who cannot wait for zoning reforms, planning committees, or long-term market shifts.
 HB 8002 may reshape how development occurs and create a savings account for middle-class home-buyers, but none of its provisions will bring unsheltered homelessness down and help people trapped in a vicious cycle of trauma. Only    Housing First    could do that.  
 I know this not just from policy research, but also from seeing it affect the lives of people I love.  
I was grateful to meet a woman in recovery who shared with me her incredible story. She told me about how she once lived unsheltered for over a year. While on the streets, she became a victim of human trafficking, was sexually assaulted by a group of men, and fell deeply into addiction and psychosis, which layered trauma on top of already existing complex post-traumatic stress disorder and schizoaffective disorder. 
 This wasn’t the result of laziness on her part. She was set up for failure from childhood after being abused by her family, and later faced more abuse in romantic relationships. She bounced around from one unsafe situation to another, without the tools to get help or help herself.  
 The turning point in her life did not come from punishment, policing, or incarceration. It came when she was enrolled in a free, stable housing program funded through the state’s Department of Rehabilitation.
 Having a door that locked, a safe place to sleep, and supportive services, as well as just one supportive person in her life, empowered her to stabilize and probably saved her life.
 After a few years of stable housing, safety, and trauma therapy, she found the strength to get sober and pursue higher education and a good career. She is still healing, but she is alive today because someone believed she deserved housing first.  
 I think about her every time I hear about some new catastrophe with my younger brother, who lives with his partner in Hartford. He is also struggling with addiction and mental illness, and is always one crisis away from getting kicked to the street.
 If that happens, he will not qualify for most housing programs because he is unwilling to give up drugs and alcohol at this time and has behavioral problems. This would exclude him from qualifying for disability or for a sober living home. And shelters, as we know, can be dangerous places where violence and assault are far too common. On top of that, the waiting lists are long.  
 As the state of Connecticut stands currently, if my brother ends up on the street, he is far more likely to die than to get better.
 “   Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy” (Proverbs 31:9).  
How we treat the people with the least in our society says everything about who we are. Connecticut calls itself compassionate and justice-driven, yet we allow hundreds of people to sleep outside every night, including in winter, because it’s easier to ignore what makes us uncomfortable. 
 The reality of high unsheltered numbers results in    real effects    on our communities. We see increased emergency calls, more unsafe encampments and public places, higher public health costs, an increase in policing and incarceration, and a greater risk for violence.
 If Connecticut wants to address housing, I believe it must adopt solutions that actually address homelessness.  Housing First is an effective method that has been tested in cities all over the    United States and Canada   , as well as in countries like    Finland  .
 Housing First looks like: permanent supportive housing on a statewide scale, deeply affordable units, not just more market-rate buildings, mental health, harm-reduction, and trauma-informed services, and strong community bonds between service recipients and providers.  
 What does HB 8002 do for the unsheltered homeless population in our state? Nothing.  
 A bill cannot be called “housing reform” when it ignores the people with no housing at all.  
 If Connecticut wants cities that are safer, more stable, cost-effective, and more reflective of our values, the way forward is Housing First. 
 Everything else is neglecting the human rights and safety of our most vulnerable nutmeggers.

We must empower organizations committed to thoughtful, community-based change.","This summer, with the support of Wesleyan University’s “Planting Seeds Program”, I had the opportunity to spend eight weeks working at the wonderful organization of New Britain ROOTS, a food justice non-profit organization located in New Britain, Connecticut. 
While working at ROOTS it became abundantly clear to me that other cities around Connecticut, and throughout the rest of the country, need support in terms of food security. All around America, families, children, and entire communities are facing the negative impacts of food insecurity. To address this challenge, federal, state, and local level systems must empower organizations like ROOTS– ones committed to thoughtful, caring, community-based change. It is imperative that this kind of work is implemented everywhere in order to encourage health and well-being throughout the country. 



Specifically, ROOTS has a mission to “cultivate community connections and equitable access to quality food through empowerment and learning with the people who grow, prepare, and eat food in New Britain.”
Their vision is promoted throughout the New Britain community via three key concepts: food access, urban agriculture, and education. 
Earlier this fall, ROOTS was able to run school-based farmers markets with 3rd and 4th grade classrooms. This was possible thanks to a grant from the Community Foundation of Greater New Britain and to partnerships formed with the New Britain school district.  
Program Manager Jenna VanDonselaar expressed what a “joyful experience [it is] to see young people shop at the market” as ROOTS is deeply committed to “immersing children in gardening, cooking and nutrition literacy at a young age”. 

Lennon Favreau

Jenna also gave insight into the community that ROOTS works with as many of their students face food insecurity and were happy to bring market food home to support their families in a time when the SNAP program is at risk due to decisions being made at the national level under the current administration.  
It is unfair to expect a child to carry the burden of providing this kind of support for their families, yet so many children throughout the country face this challenge. Jenna emphasizes that “decisionmakers… owe it to our young people” to prioritize food security at the federal and state levels– it’s all a big puzzle, and Jenna says it best: “School food is a big piece of that puzzle” 
Based on these goals and strategies, ROOTS is part of the larger, national effort to build farm-to-school initiatives. Another special part of ROOTS that helps execute these goals is school gardens located at schools around the city. 
ROOTS Community Project Manager, Alex McHardy, acknowledges that children come from diverse backgrounds and that there is importance in “helping them reconnect with their own culture through conversations centered around produce and dishes”. A large part of this goal can be done through school food.  
Farm-to-school missions ensure that students are receiving access to fresh, healthy, local, and culturally relevant food through stronger partnerships between education, agricultural, and community-based systems. In order to achieve farm-to-school goals, there has to be thoughtful collaboration amongst students, parents, school staff, nonprofit organizations, and farmers to prioritize an empowered, sustainable system in which children can thrive. 
When students face food insecurity firsthand, and are challenged with the expectation to grapple with its effects, it becomes impossible for students to learn, socialize, and maintain health. They need support from federal, state, and local systems to relieve some of this pressure. ROOTS is a huge step in the right direction in terms of mitigating the harmful impact of food insecurity. That is why we need more ROOTS, everywhere. 
In Middletown, Randall Mel Jr., the Director of Food, Nutrition and Wellness Services in Middletown Public Schools is doing an extensive amount of work to increase students’ access to fresh and nutritious foods. Randall notes that he “would love to see a similar program” to ROOTS “in Middletown–one that uplifts students and the community while leading the way in farm-to-school initiatives.” 
The love that community members and farm-to-school advocates have for ROOTS is abundantly clear. It is time that federal and state decisionmakers realize food insecurity in the United States is an issue that cannot be ignored any longer. This state and this country needs to support, uplift, and empower more organizations like ROOTS in order for our nation’s students to grow into healthier, happier, and more connected individuals.

(Photo by Christine Condon/ Maryland Matters)A coalition representing at least two Eastern Shore counties has appealed the water quality certification Maryland issued to the Conowingo Dam in September, potentially threatening a $340 million settlement with the dam’s owners.
The Clean Chesapeake Coalition’s administrative appeal, filed Nov. 14 with the Maryland Department of the Environment, argues that the years of contentious negotiations that led to the settlement were conducted behind closed doors, freezing out groups like the coalition. That has enraged the county leaders backing Clean Chesapeake’s complaint.
“That’s really why this appeal was filed, is because we heard nothing about this until the deal was done,” said Charles “Chip” MacLeod, the attorney who filed the complaint. “We don’t know whose comments they considered and to what extent they considered [them]. None of that. We’re totally outside the process.”
MacLeod argues that MDE’s procedure violated state law, rendering the certification invalid. And he said the counties also believe that the resulting agreement will not protect the health of the bay, in part because it does not require dredging behind the dam.
State environmental officials, however, argue that the agreement has tremendous implications for the bay, and the discussions had to be confidential because they concerned litigation brought against the state by groups opposed to an earlier agreement, in 2018. The officials highlight the fact that the state solicited public comment about the dam in 2023 — and took those comments into account.

“We are puzzled by the timing of this submission, as public comment occurred in 2023 as part of a seven-year effort over two administrations,” wrote Department of the Environment spokesperson Jay Apperson. “The input from county partners led to the provisions that address dredging that did not exist in the previous agreement.”
MDE officials will evaluate the complaint and “respond as appropriate,” Apperson said.
At issue is the water quality certification the state issued Constellation Energy, which owns the hydroelectric dam spanning the Susquehanna River just north of where it enters the bay. Without the certification from the state, Constellation cannot pursue a 50-year license from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission needed to operate the hydropower plant.
The nearly century-old dam once helped the ecosystem by trapping harmful sediments rushing downstream. But the pool behind the dam has become full, so it no longer has trapping capacity. That means a severe storm could unleash large quantities of sediment into the bay at once, which could smother critical underwater life.
The certification from the state — and the multimillion-dollar pledge from Constellation — was the result of several years’ worth of contentious negotiations between the state and the parties that had challenged the 2018 version of the certification, Constellation and two local waterkeepers’ groups.
Under the latest deal, Constellation agreed to pay the state about $340 million over the years for a variety of environmental initiatives, supporting everything from a new mussel hatchery to debris clean-ups and $18.7 million for dredging studies.
Appeal could slow dam’s pursuit of 50-year license from the feds
“The agreement came after years of difficult negotiations that brought the Conowingo Dam’s water quality certification process to a conclusion in a manner that protects the Chesapeake Bay and ensures the continued operation of Maryland’s largest renewable energy source,” wrote Paul Adams, a spokesman for Constellation. “MacLeod’s filing risks to delay the implementation of this historic agreement and the many investments to protect Chesapeake Bay.”
Apperson called it “reckless” for the coalition to “come in at the end of the process and try to halt real progress for Maryland.”
“Disrupting this process will only delay or possibly remove dredging and other water quality projects because it will plunge us back into even more years of delay with no action,” Apperson wrote.
In his filing, MacLeod raised other deficiencies with MDE’s certification.

He said that the department failed to adequately explain the departure from the 2018 agreement, which would have required the dam owner (then Exelon, Constellation’s former parent company) to pay up to $172 million each year, if it could not meet requirements to reduce sediment overflows.
He also wrote that MDE failed to sufficiently consider the effects of climate change, or new information like the recent decline of the Chesapeake Bay’s striped bass population, when it issued the certification to Constellation.
“Who, with a straight face, can’t say there isn’t a lot of new data and information to consider since 2018, as it relates to Chesapeake Bay water quality issues, right?” MacLeod said. “We know a lot more.”
He wrote that MDE should have considered the dam’s structural integrity when it issued the certification, pointing to FERC documents “addressing structural and monitoring issues,” including some faulty piezometers, which measure pressure on the dam, and vegetation growing in inappropriate areas.
Despite that, an August report from a FERC engineer said that, “No signs of immediate dam safety concerns were observed,” during a late-July inspection.
Constellation argues that recent inspections show Conowingo is structurally sound. The company conducts careful maintenance of the dam, Adams said, which was “built to last,” and has 93 “fully operational” piezometers. He said Constellation is consulting with FERC on a plan to add 32 more.
“FERC and Constellation regularly correspond on the subject of dam safety, which is a sign of a regulatory process that is working well and as intended,” Adams wrote.
MacLeod said that if MDE rejects the appeal, he would consider a court challenge, if he got adequate support from the counties.
He said officials in Cecil, Dorchester, Kent and Queen Anne’s counties support his petition. Leading officials in Cecil and Dorchester confirmed their support. Queen Anne’s did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The Kent County Commissioners, meanwhile, have yet to vote. But Ronald Fithian, president of the commissioners, said Kent has been a longtime supporter of the Clean Chesapeake Coalition, and he expects the three commissioners to support MacLeod’s complaint when the item hits their agenda in the coming weeks — along with a $5,000 payment to MacLeod to support the effort.
MDE tries to sway reluctant officials
With the administrative appeal under consideration, MDE officials are lobbying at least one of the opposing counties to back down.
On Tuesday, MDE officials traveled to Dorchester’s County Council meeting to advocate for the agreement — and warn about the negative consequences of an appeal.
“Any legal challenge doesn’t just pause the paperwork,” said Heather Nelson, Wetlands & Waterways Protection Program manager at MDE. “It’s freezing the funding. So all payments for mussel restoration, dredging analysis and mitigation projects are going to be stayed.”
State officials are also concerned that the Environmental Protection Agency appears very close to making changes to Section 401 of the Clean Water Act, which gives state governments the authority to issue certifications like the one issued to Constellation.
If the federal government restricts states’ authority, and the Conowingo certification is hung up by appeals, it could put the agreement at risk, meaning Constellation wouldn’t be required to make any payments to Maryland.










How many years have we been waiting to know the dredge is a problem behind the dam? But we’re going to study it, and they’ve got another 50 years before they’ve got to dredge. So guys, I am not for this program right now that you’ve got. I’m sorry.


– Dorchester County Councilman Richard Travers.


Delays could also cause FERC to issue the 50-year license with none of Maryland’s conditions, Nelson said.
“That’s a very real risk,” Nelson said. “So the legal stakes are incredibly high, and the delays risk that we end up with just years of litigation and zero environmental improvements at the dam.”
But MDE’s arguments did not seem to resonate with Dorchester officials, most of whom continued to oppose the agreement.
“How many years have we been waiting to know the dredge is a problem behind the dam? But we’re going to study it, and they’ve got another 50 years before they’ve got to dredge,” said Councilman Richard Travers. “So guys, I am not for this program right now that you’ve got. I’m sorry.”
Deputy Environment Secretary Adam Ortiz told the council that the additional studies are likely needed to try and lower the cost of dredging behind the dam, including by studying beneficial reuse for the sediment and heavy metals stuck in the reservoir. For example, Ortiz said that, with a lowered price, the federal government could be swayed to contribute.
“I wish we could get it out of Constellation. We did not have the legal authority to do that. So, this is the path: To make sure it’s economically viable, to see what’s in the sediment that is of value, that we’re able to extract and then resell,” Ortiz said.

The agreement between MDE and Constellation lets the department use the $18 million to conduct studies, or to take other actions, like to begin evaluating a dredging permit for the site. All parties are waiting for a key study from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, expected in late 2026 or early 2027.
Cecil County spokesperson Robert Royster said in a statement that the county is “extremely troubled by both the lack of transparency in these negotiations and the pressure being applied by the state to accept the agreement before we fully understand its implications.”
“Cecil County is deeply concerned that this settlement was negotiated in secret, without any consultation or input from the counties most directly affected,” Royster wrote.
He added that the county’s water intakes south of the dam, including in Perryville, Port Deposit and Havre de Grace, “continue to experience significant impacts from sediment and debris trapped behind the Conowingo Dam.”
Kent County Commission President Ronald Fithian said his personal experience as a waterman tells him that more needs to be done at the dam. He still remembers Hurricane Agnes in 1973, when the dam opened its gates and clouded the bay in massive quantities of sediment.
“That thing shut the bay down for probably at least three months after the storm, for any type of harvesting,” Fithian said. “The sediment that come down was just unbelievable.”
But the issues didn’t stop with Agnes. Especially now that the dam’s reservoir is full, he fears that it is continuing to unnaturally eject sediment into the Upper Bay — diminishing the area’s oyster industry.
He thinks Constellation should be compelled to dredge behind the dam. And he balks at the $18 million allotment to study the idea, because prior studies have come and gone with no action.
“It’s gone unattended. They’ve let it fill up. So now, we get all of the sediment, nutrients — all the nasty things that might be coming down the Susquehanna River,” Fithian said. “We get it all. And the bay just can’t keep up with it.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/HEADSHOT-198-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-09 00:57:17.654934

Ford/Maryland Matters)The Maryland General Assembly voted to include a statewide professional teacher development program known as “coaching” in the final version of the Excellence in Maryland Public Schools Act.
What lawmakers didn’t include in the act, to the dismay of education advocates, was money for the program.
So the state’s top education cheerleaders, including State Superintendent Carey Wright, will once again try to convince state legislators of the importance of coaching when the General Assembly returns next month for its 2026 session.
Wright said coaches are knowledgeable in many aspects of education such as the science of reading. In addition, they are good at working with adults and can model lessons.
“They don’t do recess duty. They don’t do bus duty. They’re not assigned to cover assessments. They’re there to work with teachers each and every day,” Wright said Monday at the Maryland READS third annual event at Maple Springs Baptist Church in Prince George’s County. More than 130 other state education officials, educators, nonprofit and community leaders and advocates turned out for the event.
The nonprofit organization’s event coincided with a report it released last month titled, “What are the Stories Behind the Scores?” that includes data from the Maryland Comprehensive Assessment Program., including results from tests students took this spring. While that program saw a third straight year of overall improvements in language arts scores, test results also showed that significant gaps remain between demographic groups, such as Black, Latino and students with disabilities.
Blueprint board approves legislative recommendations for 2026 session

In following its mantra in READS – Reading Education Aligned to Data and Science – the group released a brief Monday that said investing in sustained coaching improves literacy.
To amplify its point, it noted how Georgia students made a 15% improvement in reading scores after the state implemented a literacy coaching program to begin the 2024-25 school year. According to that state’s Department of Education, full-time literacy coaches were placed in 60 of the state’s lowest-performing elementary schools, impacting more than 18,000 students.
The Maryland READS brief summarized the importance of coaching through six pillars: trust, content focus, active learning, coherence, sustained duration and collective participation.
“This is the legislature’s opportunity to show the Nation that Maryland is committed to making the necessary investments to realize the promise of the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future” education reform plan, according to the brief. “If we make only one new investment in education, we should place our bets here.”
It could be a tough sell, as lawmakers face a potential a $1.5 billion budget deficit when they convene Jan. 14 for the 2026 legislative session.
But a few legislators did travel to Maple Springs Baptist Church in Capitol Heights, including Sen. Malcolm Augustine (D-Prince George’s) and Dels. Andrea Fletcher Harrison (D-Prince George’s), Jared Solomon (D-Montgomery), April Miller (R-Frederick) and Eric Ebersole (D-Baltimore County).
Three of the lawmakers serve on committees that review and draft education policy. Augustine serves on the Senate Education, Energy, and the Environment Committee; Ebersole and Miller serve on the House Ways and Means Committee.
Solomon, who serves on the House Appropriations Committee, which assesses the state budget, offered some advice for attendees as they try to explain to his colleagues why coaching matters.
“We need to hear from all of the folks in your network that coaching is a non-negotiable,” said Solomon, one of the legislative leaders in early childhood education. “This needs to be included in the budget. That this needs to be an investment, otherwise the Blueprint will not [work].”

School board association looking for new CEO
Milton (Milt) Nagel is leaving his job as executive director of the Maryland Association of Boards of Education to become vice president for administrative services at Chesapeake College in Wye Mills, the association has announced.
Nagel will stay on board until late spring to help with transition for a new executive director. The MABE board plans to launch a search for his replacement next month.
Nagel joined the association as deputy director in 2021. MABE President Diana Hawley, who also serves as president of the Cecil County Board of Education, said Nagel has modernized MABE during his time there, singling out his ability to expand programs and cost-saving services for school board members throughout the state while keeping dues stable.
“He’s leaving MABE in great shape for our next Executive Director. To that end, we expect to launch a search for MABE’s new Executive Director in January 2026,” Hawley stated. “We will be searching for a strategic, experienced leader who will continue to strengthen the positive culture Milt grew, and ensure MABE remains the ‘go-to’ entity for sustaining and improving public education throughout our state.”
Before MABE, Nagel spent nearly three decades with Caroline County Public Schools. for nearly three decades; as a Staff Accountant with Jefferson, Urian, Doane & Sterner, P.A.; and for eight years as a U.S. Army Reserve Officer.
“I love everything about what MABE does and stands for,” he said in a statement from the association. “Stepping away is not easy, but it’s time for me to focus more on my family, and I couldn’t pass up the opportunity presented by Chesapeake College.”

(Photo by Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)South Dakota Gov. Larry Rhoden, who has his own idea to reduce property taxes, does not sound impressed with 19 recommendations from a legislative task force.
“I’ve realized that there’s not much I’ve seen that I could support,” Rhoden told South Dakota Searchlight during a visit to Rapid City last week.
The governor’s own proposal, which he announced in March, would authorize an optional sales tax for counties. The revenue would be used to reduce property taxes for homeowners. 
“And I’ll say this, too: I’m not done yet,” Rhoden added. “We’re still looking at some other ideas.”
Lower spending, higher sales tax, revenue shifts: A closer look at 19 ways to reduce property taxes

Proposals from the governor and lawmakers will be debated during the annual legislative session at the Capitol in Pierre, which begins Jan. 13 and continues until March.
The legislative task force compiled its 19 recommendations throughout the summer. They include tweaks to existing practices, like creating an online system for property tax relief applications from elderly and disabled people, instead of requiring paper forms. Other recommendations would require major policy changes, such as cutting state spending and using the savings to reduce property taxes, capturing proceeds from a higher state sales tax rate for property tax relief, and taking money from the state’s reserve accounts and a housing infrastructure fund to provide property tax credits for homeowners.
The speaker of the state House of Representatives, Jon Hansen, R-Dell Rapids, co-chaired the Legislature’s Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force. He’s also one of the candidates challenging Rhoden for the Republican nomination for governor next year.
When the task force announced its 19 recommendations in October, Hansen framed high property taxes as a government spending problem. He authored two of the recommendations, including a request for the governor’s cooperation in cutting 5% of the spending from the state’s general fund.
“Real tax relief begins with right-sizing government,” Hansen said in a news release at the time.
Rhoden challenged that framing last week during his annual budget address to the Legislature, saying there’s little room for cuts in his lean budget proposal.
“I share the desire to cut property taxes,” Rhoden said in the speech. “But slashing health care, education and public safety is not the way to do it.”
Pressure to address rising taxes is coming from South Dakota homeowners, whose property tax payments increased nearly 40% during the past four years.
State government does not receive any property tax revenue. It relies mostly on sales taxes.
Property tax revenue goes primarily to schools and counties, with lesser amounts to cities and other local taxing entities. Cities can also impose sales taxes.

Rhoden’s proposal would give counties the option to impose a half-percent sales tax. Revenue would be used to reduce the county portion of property taxes on owner-occupied homes. Any excess revenue would be used to reduce commercial and agricultural property taxes.
Because sales taxes apply to anyone spending money in the state, Rhoden has said his plan would “shift a portion of the county tax burden to out-of-state visitors.”
County commissioners could impose the sales tax, and citizens could gather petition signatures to send the decision to local voters. The tax would be limited to a five-year renewable term.
It’s the second property tax relief idea from Rhoden since he was elevated from lieutenant governor in January, after Gov. Kristi Noem’s departure to run the federal Department of Homeland Security.
Lawmakers approved the first idea in March, and it took effect on July 1. The multifaceted law is intended to slow property tax increases. It places tighter limits on the growth of property assessments and local government budgets for five years, exempts some home improvements from affecting assessments, and makes more elderly and disabled people eligible for property tax assessment freezes by raising program limits on their income and home values.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Members of a state board overseeing charter schools said they’re running out of patience with a local high school facing allegations of alarmingly low staff levels, weak finances and poor organization.
A corrective action plan from Proud To Partner Leadership Academy, an Oklahoma City charter high school known as PTPLA, “raised more questions than answers,” Statewide Charter School Board member Damon Gardenhire said.
Starting the process to close the school is “the mood I’m in,” Gardenhire said after hearing a presentation from PTPLA’s superintendent on Monday. Ultimately, he and the rest of the board voted to give school officials until January to provide more documents and allow site visits.
That extra month is “a lifeline” for PTPLA, the statewide board’s chairperson, Brian Shellem, said. The school will remain on probation in the meantime.

As the charter authorizer for PTPLA, the statewide board has the authority to cancel the school’s founding contract, which would effectively shut down the school and cut off its state funding.
The board placed PTPLA on probation, one step away from closure, on Nov. 10 and demanded a corrective action plan. It did so after board staff reported observing only one teacher working at the school and a lack of rigorous instruction for PTPLA’s 100 students. School officials have said those reports were inaccurate.
Board staff also raised financial concerns after the school laid off teachers in October and finished the previous fiscal year with a budget deficit.
PTPLA Superintendent Dawn Bowles said she maintained a full teaching staff despite the layoffs because the affected teachers agreed to work as unpaid volunteers and for part-time pay. They could return to full-time status once the school receives additional state funding in January, she said.
Multiple statewide board members said they were still unsatisfied with Bowles’ response after listening to her present for nearly 2 1/2 hours on Monday. After her presentation, she told news reporters that her school has “no unresolved deficiencies.”

PTPLA leaders haven’t turned over even basic documents like the school’s current budget, Shellem and statewide board staff said. 
Email records, which Oklahoma Voice obtained, show PTPLA received repeated requests for all of its budgets since July 2024, the daily schedules and duties of its staff, and employee and volunteer sign-in sheets from July 1 to present.
“We’re hunting for information, and it shouldn’t be that hard,” Shellem said.
The school so far has turned over mid-to-late November timesheets for its part-time workers, its enrollment counts, details on its reduction in force and a letter state officials requested that confirmed PTPLA received a $400,000 grant this summer, according to records Oklahoma Voice received from the state board.
Bowles said she and other school leaders are willing to cooperate with the statewide board. She said “all that has been requested, we have provided.” 
“We’ll be always willing to work together, as we say, in the spirit of cooperation and partnership with transparency,” she said. “We have nothing to hide.”
Email records show PTPLA’s school board chairperson, Sharri Coleman, wrote to state officials Nov. 30 to inform them the school would not provide any documents before Monday’s meeting beyond what it submitted with its corrective action plan. 
“Our priority for the remainder of the semester is serving our Ambassadors,” Coleman wrote using the school’s term for its students, “so the Superintendent and PTPLA staff will devote their time to instruction and end-of-semester responsibilities rather than gathering new materials ahead of the Board’s review.”
On Friday, the school’s attorney sent a letter threatening legal action. 
The statewide board breached PTPLA’s charter contract by not giving sufficient notice, failing to properly evaluate the school and relying on “unverified assumptions” before placing the school on probation, according to the letter, which Oklahoma Voice obtained.
Shellem said the accusations in the letter are “baseless.”

The lawmakers — Senate President Robert Stivers, Sen. Julie Raque Adams, House Majority Floor Leader Steven Rudy and House Majority Whip Jason Nemes — spoke to a crowd that included many of their legislative colleagues and Louisville business leaders during a Monday panel hosted by Greater Louisville Inc., the local chamber of commerce. 
In the months since the last regular session, lawmakers serving on interim committees and task forces have examined issues and made recommendations. Next month, the Kentucky General Assembly will convene again in regular session in Frankfort. 
“I think you will see something, if not a lot, from virtually every task force we have had, because that’s the purpose,” Stivers, of Manchester, said at the beginning of the panel. He added that some of interim committees and task forces might be extended to review issues again.
Adams, co-chair of the Medicaid Oversight and Advisory Board, said it has been reviewing changes required of states by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump earlier this year. The measure is expected to cut federal Medicaid spending by $900 billion over 10 years. 
“Our objective here is to make sure that the Medicaid program in the state of Kentucky is not only sustainable, but is going to take care of those people who truly need it because it is our moral obligation to make sure that we care for those most vulnerable,” said Adams, of Louisville. 
With clear supermajorities in the House and Senate, Kentucky Republicans passed a law at the end of the 2025 legislative session that makes several changes to Medicaid, including a mandated work requirement for Kentuckians between the ages of 18 and 60 who don’t have dependents and are “physically and mentally able to work.” The new federal law also mandates a Medicaid work requirement.
Meanwhile, some lawmakers have been pushing for continuing to lower the state income tax despite not meeting some fiscal benchmarks in the most recent fiscal year. A 2022 Republican-backed law that reduced the individual income tax rate by a half-percentage point also created  “triggers” based on state revenues and the size of the “rainy day” fund to determine when the state can afford another half-percentage point cut. Republicans’ goal is to eventually end the state’s individual income tax altogether.
Adams said Senate Republicans discussed the issue during a recent caucus retreat and said Kentucky “didn’t miss it by a lot, but it still technically didn’t hit the formula.” 
“Our objective is to get to zero, but in the most responsible way possible,” she added. “And I think that that behooves everybody in this room, every business in this room, that we continue to maintain that responsible course.”
Stivers later said that lawmakers will have more information within the next couple of days once receipts come in for taxes paid in November. Earlier this year, the Beshear administration delayed the filing deadline for 2024 taxes to November following floods and severe storms in the winter and spring. 
Nemes, of Louisville, has argued that the delays in tax filing have delayed revenue that the state typically would have collected by now and that the state has met the legislature’s requirements for another tax cut.
“I’m going to advocate to reduce it every chance I possibly can see an opening, but if we don’t do that, I do think that being very disciplined in our budgeting is the way forward,” Nemes said, who has been one of the most vocal supporters of continuing to lower the income tax. 
As for housing needs, Adams said that a “one-size-fits-all” approach may not work statewide, as Louisville, the state’s largest city, has different needs than smaller towns. She praised some strategies underway in Louisville, such as a program introduced by Mayor Craig Greenberg for developers to turn vacant downtown office buildings into residential and mixed-use properties. 
Rudy, of Paducah, said that lawmakers will likely look at pushing back against local ordinances they believe inhibit growth, but city and county officials who “don’t have dumb policies” won’t have to worry about that. 
“We typically believe in home rule and don’t want to get involved, but sometimes some municipalities in this state kind of can’t get out of their own way, so we might get out of their own way,” Rudy said, vaguely referring to a city “60 or so miles east of here,” seemingly Lexington.

State officials say the Canton school has a day’s worth of money on hand. 
The school, which opened in August 2023 and is located in the metro area north of Jackson, will undergo a corrective action plan after its leaders meet with members of the authorizer board. The school can salvage its charter by proving it’s financially sound.
The school “continues to fail to comply with applicable laws, regulations and the terms of the charter contract based on the framework,” authorizer board Chair Candace Hunt read from the motion to start the revocation process.
It was the only charter school with “material weaknesses” tied to late financial reporting, according to an audit by Letitia Johnson, bureau director of the Mississippi Department of Education Office of School Financial Services. The school had turned in its most recent audit 23 days late, which does not meet the standard set by the authorizer board.
“This is a really big issue,” said board member Erin Meyer. It’s an issue, she said, because school boards “are not holding themselves accountable.”
The school has $24,000 of cash on hand, according to the audit. The authorizer board recommends that charter schools have between 30 to 60 days of cash.

Leaders of SR1 (Scientific Research), the Ridgeland-based organization that operates the school, disputed the audit findings. School business manager Iraiz Gonzaga sent Mississippi Today a screenshot of the school’s November bank statement from Trustmark, which showed a $171,079 balance.
Authorizer board members also criticized the school for projecting a 300 student enrollment for 2027, which would be an increase in 225 students from its current enrollment of 103. The school had already amended its enrollment target for the past year’s financial paperwork.
If the Mississippi Board of Education finds SR1 didn’t meet its enrollment target, the school could lose funding. Funding is tied to enrollment, and can be taken back by the Education Department in future budget allocations.
“They have not met their enrollment target since they’ve been operational,” authorizer board Executive Director Lisa Karmacharya said. “This is not just about the (performance) framework. These are continuing concerns around enrollment.”
In 2023, just months after the school opened, state officials considered pulling its charter because it had enrolled 15 students instead of the 150 students in kindergarten and first grade projected to attend in the school’s approved charter application. 
On Monday, Karmacharya also raised concerns that enrollment dropped from 23 students in first grade to 16 in second grade the next school year. Overall enrollment rose from 12 students in 2023-24 to 84 in 2024-25. 
“So what that says to me is potentially they’re not staying,” Karmacharya said. “You want your kiddos to matriculate through and stay over time.”
The school introduces courses in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) at the elementary level. Its curriculum was set up to be informed by “the latest in neuroscience, psychology, and other fields,” embracing principles of “biophilic design” and “neuroarchitecture.”
SR1 College Preparatory and STEM Academy is not the only school in Mississippi that officials say is in financial trouble. In November, the state Department of Education voted to take over the Okolona Municipal Separate School District for the second time in 15 years. District officials couldn’t make the school system’s November payroll.
But leadership for the Canton charter school denied that they are unable to pay staff like Okolona schools. 
Gonzaga, the school’s business manager, challenged the inability to fact check claims made during the authorizer board’s discussion about the motion. The Mississippi Charter Authorizer Board allows school representatives to make speeches during a designated public comment period, but does not allow representatives to fact check claims during debates surrounding votes.
“SR1 CPSA remains committed to transparency, academic excellence, and respectful collaboration,” Gonzaga said.

U.S. District Judge Zachary Bluestone ruled he had no jurisdiction over the lawsuit brought on behalf of Secretary of State Denny Hoskins and the General Assembly claiming the U.S. Constitution bars state referendums on Congressional district plans.
The decision came just a few hours after Cole County Circuit Judge Christopher Limbaugh conducted a three-hour trial over when a referendum petition drive can begin and which signatures should be counted when petitions are submitted.
Limbaugh did not issue a ruling Monday and gave attorneys until Wednesday afternoon to file proposed judgments.
Dark money groups pour cash into fight over gerrymandered Missouri congressional map

The redistricting bill forced through in September by Republicans at the insistence of President Donald Trump is scheduled to take effect Thursday for use in the 2026 elections.
Republicans hope to win seven of the state’s eight congressional seats by adding enough GOP votes to flip the 5th District, currently held by Democratic U.S. Rep. Emanuel Cleaver of Kansas City. 
If referendum petitions with sufficient signatures are submitted, the map will take effect only if it is upheld in a statewide vote in November.
The issues in the now-dismissed federal case can all be decided in state court, wrote Bluestone, a recent Trump appointee. All Hoskins has to do, he said, is reject the petitions gathered by People Not Politicians, the campaign committee seeking the referendum.
The deadline for submitting signatures is Thursday.
“Fortunately for the state, Secretary Hoskins has a tool at his disposal that almost no other litigant could boast — the power to declare the petition unconstitutional himself,” Bluestone wrote.
That would trigger litigation over the main question, he wrote.
“A decision that the Missouri Constitution does not permit a redistricting referendum would moot the state’s federal constitutional claims, while a decision that it does clearly permit them would significantly narrow the issues,” Bluestone wrote. “Further, abstaining here would avoid federal interference in a referendum process created entirely by the Missouri Constitution and state law.”
 State lawsuit over signatures

The main question in the lawsuit heard Monday afternoon by Limbaugh is when a referendum petition drive can begin.
Attorney Chuck Hatfield, representing People Not Politicians, said the Missouri Constitution’s clause giving the people the “power to approve or reject by referendum any act of the general assembly” means signature gathering can begin as soon as lawmakers hold the final vote on a bill. 
“We don’t need the governor’s signature on something to seek a referendum on it,” Hatfield said. “Nor do we need the secretary of state’s approval to gather signatures.”
Deputy Solicitor General William Seidleck, arguing for the state, said a referendum can only be held on a law. No bill, he said, even if passed by lawmakers, is a law until it is signed by the governor. And a law giving the secretary of state authority to approve or reject the form of a referendum petition, he said, means no signatures can be gathered until the approval is received.
“You can only have a referendum on an enacted law,” Seidleck said. “We submit that there’s no law without the governor’s signature.”
Marc Ellinger, who represents a campaign committee set up to defend the map, Put Missouri First, asked Limbaugh to throw the whole case out as premature. No signatures have been submitted, he said, so there’s no true controversy over which are being counted.
“They’re trying to get an answer on the validity of signatures before the statutory process is completed,” Ellinger said.
To force a referendum on a new law, petitioners must get signatures from 5% of voters in six of the state’s eight congressional districts. That is about 110,000 signatures.
People Not Politicians has enlisted more than 2,000 volunteers and gathered more than 300,000 signatures, including 12,000 last week, campaign Director Richard von Glahn said during a Monday morning conference call with the Missouri Voter Protection Coalition.
“We are going to continue to fight to make sure every Missourian’s voice is heard,” von Glahn said to coalition members.
Missouri GOP goes scorched earth to keep its gerrymandered map off the 2026 ballot

In the afternoon, von Glahn was in a Cole County courtroom while Chrissy Peters, state elections director since 2017, testified that unless a court order says otherwise, no signatures collected before Oct. 14 will be checked against voter registration rolls.
That is a key date because it’s the day Hoskins approved the form of the petition. In the lawsuit, People Not Politicians is arguing that signatures gathered after Sept. 15, when the petition form was submitted, should be checked.
Of the 300,000 signatures the campaign says it has collected, the outcome of Monday’s hearing would only impact an estimated 92,000 that were pre-emptively rejected by Hoskins. 
Limbaugh has another decision pending that will impact whether or not the referendum occurs. He heard arguments Nov. 12 in a lawsuit brought by opponents of redistricting over the state Constitution’s directive on when and how to draw congressional district maps. 
If Limbaugh rules lawmakers did not have power to redraw the districts between census reports, the law would not take effect. 
The Missouri redistricting fight is part of a national debate over when states can redraw congressional district boundaries for partisan advantage.
Republicans hold a 220-213 edge in the U.S. House, with two vacant seats previously held by Democrats. Six states, including Missouri, have enacted new congressional maps this year in response to the push initiated when Texas redrew its district lines to flip five Democratic seats. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld the new Texas map last week.
California countered and revised its maps to move five seats to the Democratic Party,
North Carolina’s new map is intended to net one seat for Republicans, Ohio has passed a new map to add two GOP seats and a nonpartisan redistricting commission in Utah revised that state’s four districts in a way likely to favor a Democratic candidate in one.
Other redistricting efforts are underway. In Indiana, the legislature is meeting in special session to help the GOP gain two seats. Democrats who took supermajorities in the Virginia legislature this year are considering whether to revise lines in that state, where Democrats currently hold a 6-5 edge in the delegation.
As the date for delivering signatures in Missouri approaches, attacks on the petitioners and von Glahn have intensified. Hanaway is demanding personnel records from Advanced Micro Targeting of Dallas, Texas, which is being paid to help with the signature campaign. And Advanced Micro Targeting is suing other political consulting firms, accusing them of paying large sums to sabotage the petition drive.
Donald Trump Jr. led the attacks on von Glahn on social media, calling him a “leftist nut job” who is “trying to STEAL a GOP house seat in Missouri through an unlawful referendum.”
Trump Jr. included a link to a website that called von Glahn a communist.
Denise Lieberman, executive director of the Missouri Voter Protection coalition, called the attacks “absolutely disgusting and inexcusable” during the conference call.
Von Glahn said the insults are generating a counter-reaction.
“These are meant to be sort of psychological warfare, to make me and my family feel isolated and feel threatened,” he said. “It has been a complete backfire. I have gotten more messages of love and support across this state and across the country this week that I could have possibly imagined.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_2302-e1755617763363.jpg,,,2025-12-08 21:56:30.886771

(Photo by James Brooks/Alaska Beacon)Republican officials in the Matanuska-Susitna Borough have proposed a field of six conservative Alaskans for two vacant seats in the Alaska House of Representatives.
On Sunday, local Republican Party officials delivered their suggestions to replace Cathy Tilton and George Rauscher, whom Gov. Mike Dunleavy appointed to fill two vacancies in the Alaska Senate.
Those Senate vacancies occurred when Sen. Mike Shower, R-Wasilla, resigned to run for lieutenant governor and Sen. Shelley Hughes, R-Palmer, resigned to run for governor.
To replace Tilton, the Republican leaders of House District 26 nominated Chickaloon tribal police chief Donna Anthony, veterinarian Sean McPeck, and a former Tilton aide, Steve St. Clair.
Anthony, McPeck and St. Clair have each filed to run for the seat in next year’s elections. 
For Rauscher’s former seat, Republican leaders for House District 29 picked Chikaloon tribal police officer Lucas Howard, local community council member Gerald Garret Nelson, and former police officer John James. 
Nelson had previously filed a letter of intent to run for the seat next year. 
The nominations are advisory only; Dunleavy may pick anyone who is a Republican, lives in the appropriate district and meets the constitutional requirements for state House.
Under state law, the governor has until Dec. 29 to make his picks. Anyone he chooses must be approved by a majority of the House’s 21 Republicans in order to be seated. 
The governor is expected to act well before the deadline in order to allow time for that confirmation vote and for the new legislators to hire staff and prepare to move to Juneau for the five-month regular legislative session, which begins Jan. 20.
House Minority Leader DeLena Johnson, R-Palmer, is in charge of the House’s all-Republican minority caucus. 
Through a spokesperson, Johnson said the timing of a confirmation vote is dependent upon the governor, but that she is tentatively planning a vote for the upcoming weekend.

It's never a good idea, but particularly so now when the multiyear plan's school reform measures are just starting to pay off.","Elementary school students take a standardized test in this file photo. (Photo by Will and Deni McIntyre/Getty Stock Photo)Every time Maryland’s budget woes make headlines, the same tired scapegoat gets dragged out: the Blueprint for Maryland’s Future, which is Maryland’s plan and funding system for public education. State spokespeople and some media outlets keep repeating that our fiscal challenges stem from “too much spending on education.” It’s an easy line. It’s also wrong—and it ignores what cuts would mean for kids, families, and entire school communities.
When someone says we should “cut the Blueprint,” they aren’t talking about trimming a line on a spreadsheet. The Blueprint is not a separate program. It is the state’s commitment to public schools. They are talking about eliminating legally required services for children: fewer reading specialists, counselors, tutors, college and career pathways, and fewer supports for the students who need them most. Stripping money from the Blueprint means taking resources out of public schools, classrooms, and communities. It’s not abstract. It’s kids who pay.
Yes, the Blueprint is ambitious. Yes, it invests more money than the state was spending before. But that investment was necessary because Maryland allowed its education system to slide from first in the nation to the middle of the pack. The Blueprint was born of a crisis lawmakers could no longer ignore. Maryland voters overwhelmingly support education and want this kind of long-term, systemic improvement.
Now we’re finally seeing progress on early literacy, college- and career-readiness pathways, staffing, and student supports. More kindergartners are entering school ready to learn, attendance is improving, and test scores are moving in the right direction. Cutting or stalling now would mean walking away just as the work is beginning to pay off.

More importantly, funding education isn’t optional. It’s the law—and it’s the only constitutional requirement our state has around budgeting. The legislature passed the Blueprint,  overrode a governor’s veto, and has had four years to shore up the Blueprint fund. They have known about the structural gaps. They have seen the fiscal forecasts. And year after year, they’ve chosen not to act with the urgency required.
Instead, every session follows the same pattern: the Fair Share Maryland coalition brings forward a sensible package of revenue solutions that don’t put more responsibility on working families—closing loopholes, modernizing outdated tax structures, and asking ultra-wealthy corporations and individuals to pay their fair share. And every year, lawmakers nibble at the edges, doing just enough to keep the ship afloat for another year. That isn’t leadership. It’s procrastination.
And let’s be clear: the Blueprint isn’t the only pressure point in the budget. The Transportation Trust Fund has been structurally out of balance for years. Child care scholarships are frozen. Much-needed environmental investments have been cut. The developmental disabilities community must annually fight just to maintain underfunded services.
Delaying hard revenue decisions affects every corner of state government — yet education keeps taking the blame even when it isn’t the only driver. The truth is, Maryland doesn’t have a spending problem; it has a courage problem. We can support schools, transportation, and everything else in the budget — if we choose to.
If the governor and legislature want to meet their legal and moral obligations, it’s time to get serious about revenue. There are real, workable proposals on the table: Closing loopholes that let massive multistate corporations pay less than local small businesses, and strengthening enforcement to ensure the state actually collects money already owed. And we don’t have to guess whether these strategies work. Look at Massachusetts: its millionaire’s tax has generated more than $5 billion in just three years, funding state-supported health care and universal free school meals. Its public schools continue to rank #1 or #2 nationally—and far from driving wealthy residents away, the number of millionaires in Massachusetts actually grew.
Education is an investment, not a liability. A fully funded Blueprint strengthens Maryland’s workforce, attracts families and employers, and grows our tax base. Shortchanging schools today guarantees a weaker economy tomorrow.
We are only five years away from full Blueprint phase-in. Maryland’s children, families, and educators have held up their end of the bargain. Now it’s time for the Governor and legislature to hold up theirs—and finish what they started.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/GettyImages-523290806-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-08 21:56:30.886771

Campbell County legal case adds to the list of disputes challenging the public’s ability to access and go hunting on public land, access advocates say. 
The post A Wyoming man can legally reach his land, but a lawsuit contends he can’t stop to hunt public land along the way. appeared first on WyoFile .","A large landowner is suing his Wyoming neighbor in an effort to stop him from hunting thousands of acres of “landlocked” public land that he crosses to reach his cabin in the Powder River Basin. 
The lawsuit by Frank and Michael Maestri argues that Rozet resident Calvin Ten Braak has been violating the terms of a road easement leading to his property by hunting on public land along the approximately 10-mile-long route. The dispute came to light in June, when Ten Braak was sent a cease-and-desist letter from the Maestris, who had recently purchased thousands of acres of private land that Ten Braak’s easement also cuts through. 
“The purpose of the Easement is to allow access to the grantees’ property, not public property,” states the cease-and-desist letter, signed by Sheridan attorney Cole Gustafson. “The Easement shall solely be used for ingress and egress.”
“Simply put,” the letter goes on, “this Easement does not give you a right to cross private land as a thoroughfare to public land for hunting.” 
Calvin Ten Braak’s easement to his southeastern Campbell County Land is marked in dark gray on the lower left portion of this map. (Campbell County)
Ten Braak lawyered up. In July, Laramie attorney Alan Harding sent a letter back on Ten Braak’s behalf, arguing that the cease-and-desist letter and trespass notice were “baseless and in bad faith.” 
“The Easement does not confer upon your clients any authority to regulate or limit the use of public lands,” reads the retort. “Public lands are held in trust for the benefit of the public, and access to such lands cannot be curtailed by private parties absent statutory authority or ownership interest.”
The exchange precipitated a lawsuit, which was filed less than three weeks later. The case is still in the early stages. Harding filed a motion to dismiss in August and the plaintiffs responded in September. Then last week, Campbell County District Court Judge Mike McGrady held a hearing on the matter. A trial has been scheduled for December 2026.
Reached by WyoFile, Ten Braak declined an interview for this story under the guidance of his attorney, Harding, who also declined.
Frank Maestri, whose family owns Big Horn Spirits and a Mexican tequila distillery, returned WyoFile’s call and said he wanted to make a “short and simple” point.
“I just want to be clear: This is a private land case,” he said. “It has nothing to do with access to public land.”
A map of Ten Braak’s easement, which was recorded in November 2024, shows that his access road cuts through Maestri’s and both state-owned and Bureau of Land Management property. 
The otherwise inaccessible BLM parcel accessed via the easement totals more than 16,500 acres, according to the GPS mapping app OnX Hunt.

For the past seven years, Ten Braak has shared access to his easement with Hunting with Heroes, a Casper-based nonprofit that takes disabled veterans hunting, fishing and into the outdoors. 
Sundance resident Terry Wilkerson has guided the outings, taking combat veterans onto state and BLM land via Ten Braak’s road. 
“The first hunt we took out there, he was a 90-year-old Korean War vet,” Wilkerson told WyoFile on Monday. “Couldn’t hardly walk, but we were able to get him a nice bull. We had a 100% disabled Air Force vet that had terminal cancer of the brain, and he got a nice bull. So we’ve done a lot of great things for 100% disabled vets through the years.” 
Wilkerson has been paying attention to the legal proceedings. He was surprised that the lawsuit wasn’t immediately dismissed, and he worries about the precedent it’ll create if the judge rules in the Maestri family’s favor. 
“I would think it would be a no-brainer that the judge would say, ‘You can’t keep them from going on public land,’” Wilkerson said. “If this is upheld, I think it’s going to have a tremendous negative impact on access to a lot of public land.” 
The Campbell County dispute over easement-granted access to public land follows the high-profile years-long legal fight in Carbon County over “corner crossing,” which is stepping from one public parcel to the next where public land meets at the corner. Ultimately, the dispute, which became an international story, shook out in the public’s favor. 
This new dispute in northeast Wyoming is also starting to attract attention. It’s come across the radar of Laramie Democratic Rep. Karlee Provenza, who often advocates for state policies encouraging public access to public land.
“This is a demonstration of the lengths that someone will go to, to block access to public land,” Provenza said of the Campbell County dispute. “I’m grateful for Mr. Ten Braak standing up to this and saying no.”

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — CoreCivic gave up its fight to avoid following the city of Leavenworth’s development process and applied for a special use permit.
In a news release on its website, the city said Monday it received the application but did not say when it was filed.
“City Staff and the City’s legal team are currently reviewing the application and anticipate working with CoreCivic’s representatives on the public process,” the news release said.
Tentative public hearing dates are set for the planning commission, Feb. 2; first consideration by the Leavenworth City Commission, Feb. 24; and second consideration by the city commission, March 10. Hearings are broadcast on the city’s YouTube channel.
The city of Leavenworth and CoreCivic, a Tennessee-based private prison company, have been fighting in court since early this year over whether CoreCivic needed to follow the city’s special use permit process.
The company in September signed a contract with U.S. Immigration and Custums Enforcement valued at $60 million a year to house immigrant detainees at its Leavenworth facility, but the agreement doesn’t take effect until legal issues are resolved. A turning point in the court cases seemed to come when CoreCivic lost a legal battle last week in which it asked a judge to allow it to begin holding prisoners. At the time, a CoreCivic spokesman indicated the company was considering all paths to move forward, including bowing to the city’s demands that it follow the permit process.
Scott Peterson, Leavenworth city manager, said after the court loss that the city is willing to work on the special permitting process with CoreCivic. The company had been four months into the process when it decided to withdraw, he said.
“We’d had significant conversations, met with them multiple times,” Peterson said, adding that he and his assistant had toured the facility. “We were prepared to put together a packet for presentation to the planning commission, so we were ready to go.”

BOSTON — A federal judge on Monday ruled in favor of Massachusetts and more than a dozen states that sued the Trump administration in May over President Donald Trump’s day-one offshore wind memo. The directive has frozen permitting since January, pending a comprehensive review by federal agencies.
The states argued the memo is unlawful and has caused significant harm – stymieing domestic investment, jeopardizing states’ abilities to supply enough electricity, and creating an “existential threat” to the industry.
Judge Patti B. Saris seemed to agree with their legal claims: “The State Plaintiffs have produced ample evidence demonstrating that they face ongoing or imminent injuries due to the Wind Order.”
On the flip side, she delivered sharp criticism of the federal government’s arguments and the wind memo itself, writing that it fails to adequately explain or support such a significant change in course from the agencies’ prior permitting practices.
“Whatever level of explanation is required when deviating from longstanding agency practice, this is not it,” Judge Saris wrote.
“The Court concludes that the Wind Order constitutes a final agency action that is arbitrary and capricious and contrary to law,” she wrote. “Accordingly, the Court allows Plaintiffs’ motions… denies the Agency Defendants’ motion…, and declares unlawful and vacates the Wind Order” in its entirety.
Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Campbell in a statement Monday called the ruling a “critical victory.”
“Massachusetts has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into offshore wind, and today, we successfully protected those important investments from the Trump Administration’s unlawful order,” Campbell wrote.
During a hearing last month, the federal government provided no end date for this project-wide review prescribed by the memo, which is going on 11 months and counting while permitting remains paused.
“The Agency Defendants have represented that the Comprehensive Assessment is ‘underway’ but have provided no information about its timeline,” wrote Judge Saris in the 47-page ruling.
“Until full processing of applications related to wind energy projects resumes, no such project can move forward,” she continued. “Indeed, as was previously held in this litigation, the Wind Order amounts to a ‘de facto suspension of the law with respect to wind energy development.’”



The memo ordered the Interior Department to review the “ecological, economic, and environmental necessity of terminating or amending any existing wind energy … and submit a report with recommendations to the President.”
The federal government asked that if the judge were to rule in the states’ favor, that it be limited only for certain projects, not all projects. Judge Saris, however, wrote that a project-specific “vacatur” is not feasible due to the breadth of the wind memo.
A status conference has been set for next week for the parties to meet before Judge Saris.
It is unclear what relief such a ruling will bring to the wind projects and the states, who want to see the federal agencies issue pending permits to the projects.
The ruling does not order a particular outcome, such as the agencies issuing the permit approvals, Judge Saris notes. Rather, her order regards agencies processing permits and making a determination within a reasonable time, as required under statute.

“The Agency Defendants may not, as they have done here, decline to adjudicate applications altogether, for an unspecified time,” she wrote. “The proof is in the pudding: No permits have issued since the Wind Order was promulgated, and the Agency Defendants acknowledge that they will not issue any permits at least until they complete the Comprehensive Assessment, for which there is no timeline.”
Gov. Maura Healey in a statement said the commonwealth needs offshore wind to “meet demand, create jobs and lower costs,” and thanked the AG’s office for its work to “defend this crucial energy source, protecting jobs and economic activity across the country and here in Massachusetts.”
Erica Fuller, senior counsel at the Conservation Law Foundation, said the ruling is a “victory for offshore wind but also the rule of law.”
“This unlawful moratorium was meant to be a gift to polluting fossil fuel companies from the Trump administration,” Fuller said. “It’s unclear what the Trump administration will do with this ruling. It is appealable. And the impact of it on any particular project is also determined by many factors but could become more clear after the status conference.”
The Light contacted the Interior Department Monday night for comment.

The health benefit plan is designed to prevent financial ruin from catastrophic illness or injury, such as a car crash or bear attack.
The post Wyoming health department pitches ‘BearCare’ for medical emergencies. Lawmakers are skeptical. appeared first on WyoFile .","As Wyoming residents brace for the country’s highest jump in Obamacare insurance premium costs, the Wyoming Department of Health is proposing an alternative to prevent the kind of financial ruin that can result from catastrophic illness or injury. 
The proposal would establish a state-operated public benefit plan, dubbed “BearCare,” that would cover health care emergencies, such as a car crash or a bear attack, for dues-paying members. 
State lawmakers, however, expressed concern over costs, sustainability and even the name of the program as the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee met Monday in Cheyenne. 
“I don’t think we’re supposed to create programs that can’t be sustained,” Appropriations Committee Co-Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, said at the meeting. 
Initially, the program would rely on federal funds currently up for grabs and earmarked to transform rural health care, but it would ultimately be self-funded via members’ monthly enrollment fees. Based on the Department of Health’s description, it would be somewhat akin to private catastrophic insurance plans, where people pay low premiums for high-deductible coverage that’s useful for major health emergencies, but doesn’t cover typical care.
“We have a very unique year this year, given the opportunity from the Trump administration and Congress with the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act and the Rural Health Transformation Program funding that’s currently in process,” Department of Health Director Stefan Johansson told lawmakers Monday. 
The federal program is designed to funnel $50 billion to state-designed programs meant to improve rural health care, and Wyoming stands to receive up to $800 million. The state submitted its application in November, which included BearCare in addition to plans to stabilize hospitals, bolster preventative health care, grow the workforce and use technology to improve access. The funding will be doled out over five years. 
The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services expect to announce winners Dec. 31. In the meantime, the Department of Health is asking lawmakers to include a placeholder in the state budget bill.

“We don’t know what our ultimate award — if we get an award — from the federal government would be in that program,” Johansson said at the meeting. “So in full transparency, we wanted to bring that request for spending authority, should we be approved in that program and should the state want to accept those funds.” 
The BearCare portion of the application, however, gave several committee members heartburn. 
“I just don’t see how this is the proper role of government,” Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, said, echoing the committee’s discussion last week regarding the Wyoming Business Council’s efforts to improve the state’s economy. 
This fall, the department surveyed residents and held 11 public meetings across the state to collect input for its federal application. 
“We did not hear back a wish list of all the expensive, short-term things that every community wanted,” Johansson told lawmakers. What the department heard instead included a desire for emergency services at critical access hospitals, regional access to OB-GYN and maternity care and “an ambulance that shows up relatively quick when you call 911.
“Those things that we heard, we really designed the application around,” he  said. 
Monday marked the second week of the committee’s budget hearings ahead of the 2026 legislative session. 
Ahead of budget hearings, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — a group of Republicans who control the House — pledged to cut the budget, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. And over the legislative off-season, lawmakers took extra steps to scrutinize the Department of Health’s budget by forming a subcommittee. 
BearCare
While the name is a nod to “Wyoming’s deeply forested areas and bear population,” Johansson said, “it kind of hearkens back to what some people knew health insurance to be in previous decades.”
By offering small employers and individuals an affordable benefit plan that is closer in spirit to auto insurance — it covers collisions, but won’t pay for basic maintenance — the plan would provide the “bare necessities,” Johansson said. 
The lawmaker who shares his last name with the program did not back the effort, suggesting two alternatives, including a different name. 
“Without your objection, I’m going to call it ‘GordonCare,’” Rep. Bear said, presumably in reference to Gov. Mark Gordon, who lauded the proposal in his budget letter. 
BearCare is “an innovative, but basic, health benefit plan that offers individuals and small businesses a practical alternative to costly ObamaCare insurance,” Gordon wrote. 
Instead of a health benefit plan, Bear suggested the state consider tackling the problem “from the other side” by creating a “perpetuity fund” to help cover hospitals’ unpaid bills. 
But that likely wouldn’t work within the confines of the Rural Health Transformation Program, Johansson said. 
“In fact, a lot of the guidance from the federal government when it came specifically just to fixing or correcting balance sheets, [it] will likely not be allowable,” he said. 
Rep. Bill Allemand, R-Casper, said he was concerned the program would force the state into an income tax. Johansson was clear that wouldn’t be the case.
“Mr. Chairman, Rep. Allemand, my answer would be unequivocally no,” Johansson said. 
Sen. Mike Gierau, D-Jackson, was the one committee member to speak in favor of BearCare.
“I’m a small business person, so I’m kind of keen on this,” Gierau said. “What you’re trying to do isn’t trying to provide that big of a social [safety] net. You’re just trying to give a hand up to help small businesses [to] be able to handle a problem that I have to face every single day in my business.” 
Gierau also said he expected to see increased interest in such a program.
“If the increases in the ACA kick in the way they’re going to kick in,” he said, “I got a hunch you may hear some more clamoring, but that’s just a guess.” 
Roughly 45,000 Wyoming residents who get health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace are set to experience the highest price jumps in the nation, as WyoFile previously reported. In Wyoming, a 60-year-old person earning roughly $63,000 annually could face a 421% increase in average monthly premium costs on the ACA marketplace, according to reporting by KFF, a nonprofit that writes about health care.
Budget hearings will continue through this week before resuming Jan. 5. The committee is not expected to take any formal action on the budget bill until the week of Jan. 12.

(Photo by Will Price/West Virginia Legislative Photography)State lawmakers are entering the upcoming legislative session hoping to make improvements to West Virginia’s overwhelmed foster care system, announcing 16 bills so far to fix long-standing problems. One measure would put body cameras on Child Protective Services workers, and another bill would require some counties to use artificial intelligence to help CPS with high case loads.
Republican lawmakers also want to increase in-state facilities for foster children with the goal of bringing 543 foster children who are in out-of-state group homes back to West Virginia. 
West Virginia spent nearly $70 million last fiscal year to house foster children in out-of-state facilities, and some children kept in-state end up living in hotels. The state could funnel that money to in-state facilities.
“When it comes to foster care, time is always of the essence. We’re talking about kids that are not getting younger, and so every day of a child’s life means something,” said Del. Adam Burkhammer, R-Lewis, a foster parent who is spearheading child welfare legislation. “I am an impatient person that wants results now, but I understand government doesn’t move as fast as I would like, but I’m still going to push that we get results as soon as possible.”

Foster care reform was a major theme for lawmakers’ December interim meetings this week at the state Capitol. The part-time Legislature is grappling with how to make improvements to the struggling foster care system run by the executive branch. 
Many of lawmakers’ proposed foster care bills will take state funds and buy-in from the Department of Human Services, both of which could be an uphill battle. 
“We’re trying to build a collaborative approach, because it does truly take all three branches of government to make the child welfare system function well,” Burkhammer said. 
Sen. Vince Deeds, who is also sponsoring child welfare legislation, said the bills have followed conversations with constituents about problems in the child welfare system.
“We don’t want [the Department of] Human Services to think that we’re Big Brother, and we’re really going to beat them down all the time,” said Deeds, R-Greenbrier. “We want to support them and lift them up and try to help them in any way we possibly can.”
Tiffany Wilson, a foster parent in Parkersburg, hopes lawmakers will consider changes to help families caring for children who often need behavioral support and medical help. 
She has four foster children ages 1 to 7 and has adopted a 12 year old. One child needs out-of-state medical testing; another child attends a doctor’s appointment hours away from her home. 
“We need more support with that stuff and more understanding,” Wilson said. “We need to meet kids where they are and not causing more trauma.”
The stipend for foster families doesn’t go far with soaring grocery prices, she added.
Gov. Patrick Morrisey has announced his own plans to reform the long-troubled foster care system, saying he would end “years of bureaucratic stonewalling” that the system saw under Gov. Jim Justice and improve outcomes for kids. 
Earlier this year, Morrisey vetoed child welfare-related legislation, including a bill that would have provided pay raises for attorneys representing foster children. He also slashed lawmakers’ funding for a nonprofit that helps foster children. 
Del. Elliott Pritt, R-Fayette, said that he will vote no on tax cut legislation, spending bills and the state budget until lawmakers put forth a funding plan to address inadequacies in the child welfare system.
His announcement came after the Barboursville School, an in-patient children’s psychiatric facility, announced it will close.
“I think this just has to be our biggest priority,” said Pritt, who is a public school teacher. “Our funds are healthy, our [Rainy Day Fund] is healthy … Let’s do what we need to do for kids.”

Republicans unveil 16 foster care bills for 2026 legislative session
Last November, a trio of Republican lawmakers, including Burkhamer and Deeds, stood before their colleagues in the Senate Chamber and provided a grim look at the foster care system. There weren’t enough in-state homes, workers or programs to help 6,000 vulnerable children in state care.
“I think we’re exactly where we were last year, and the numbers would show that we’re still hovering around that 6,000 kids in care, so we’re not improving on that,” Burkhammer said. 
A report from a $348,000 foster care listening tour, spearheaded by DoHS, showed there was “more focus on blame than solving problems” in the state’s child welfare system.
At the Capitol this week, Republican lawmakers unveiled 16 bills after a child welfare work group spent the last year crafting ideas to improve foster care.
“[The kids] are victims of sometimes terrible circumstances,” Deeds said. “I think with some of the initiatives we have this year, they’ll be passed and become effective legislation.”
One bill would require CPS workers to wear a body camera while investigation reports of child abuse and neglect. The legislation, as written, would require CPS workers to obtain consent from the person being investigated in certain circumstances. The video footage could not be obtained through the Freedom of Information Act.
“We believe in building trust back in a system that has lost trust throughout our state, and we believe that this will be very transparent in what we do,” Burkhammer said. “We can see the success that law enforcement has and wearing their body cameras and the trust that was rebuilt in all the communities.”
Wilson, a former CPS worker, said a social worker hadn’t been to her home since four boys were placed there in September.
 “First of all, a CPS worker has to come into the home,” she said. 
Lawmakers also want to create a pilot program in two counties that would require the “use of mobile devices, including tablets, to assist CPS workers in conducting child abuse and neglect investigations in most cases. The technology price isn’t known at this time.
High caseloads continue to be a problem for CPS workers, lawmakers said.
Deeds, a former police officer, said AI has assisted law enforcement by reducing paperwork.
“The technology is there, and it’s proven,” he said. 
Other bills would: create a pay raise for public defenders working on child abuse and neglect cases; require that Bureau of Social Services’ rules about child welfare go through legislative review for approval; shortening the timeline that courts can consider terminating parental rights to prevent cases from lingering in the system.
Another measure would require DoHS to develop a statewide prevention plan and implement it with lawmaker oversight.
Bills will be more thoroughly discussed during the session, which begins Jan. 14, 2026.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)North Arkansas’ Blanchard Springs Caverns is in the process of becoming Arkansas’ 53rd state park, Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Monday.
Sanders and Parks, Heritage and Tourism Secretary Shea Lewis signed a memorandum of understanding with the U.S. Forest Service to begin redesignating Arkansas’ second-largest cave system, which sits in the Ozark-St. Francis National Forest in Stone County.
The cave system includes eight and a half miles of explorable limestone caverns and access to a creek that flows into the White River. It has been open to the public since 1973, and Sanders said at Monday’s news conference that more than 70,000 people visit the caves per year.
Sanders said Blanchard Springs Caverns “will elevate the best state parks in America” and “can rival Carlsbad Caverns or Mammoth Cave,” national parks in New Mexico and Kentucky, respectively.
In 1996, Arkansas voters approved a constitutional amendment that increased the state sales tax by one-eighth of one cent to fund land conservation. Sanders noted that this occurred during the administration of her father, former Gov. Mike Huckabee.
Reinvesting this revenue in parks like Blanchard Springs Caverns bolsters Arkansas’ multibillion-dollar tourism industry, Sanders said.
Her husband, First Gentleman Bryan Sanders, chairs the Natural State Initiative, which the governor launched shortly after taking office in 2023 in an effort to expand Arkansas’ outdoor economy.
“Arkansas’ natural beauty is one of our greatest competitive advantages, and places like Blanchard Springs shows why,” Bryan Sanders said in a Monday news release from the governor’s office. “Designating it as a state park will not only protect this incredible place but also open the door to more adventure, exploration, and the kind of outdoor experiences that support families and local communities.”

The redesignation of Blanchard Springs Caverns “is what the Natural State Initiative looks like in action” and hopefully “will make Arkansas a place people want to return to again and again,” Lewis said at the news conference.
Deputy Regional Forester Mary Moore of the U.S. Forest Service praised the agency’s “positive, collaborative” relationship with the state’s parks department.
“The partnership we have is reliable and trustworthy, and our agencies share common goals for the mutual benefit of residents and visitors alike,” Moore said.
Sanders and state Sen. Missy Irvin, a Republican representing Stone County, credited President Donald Trump and U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins with facilitating the process of redesignating Blanchard Springs Caverns.
Sanders thanked leaders of the Caddo, Osage and Quapaw nations of Indigenous communities for being “very helpful in this process.”
The Osage Nation considers Blanchard Springs Caverns a sacred location, and the park’s annual Christmas caroling in the caverns went on hiatus in 2019 due to the tribe’s disapproval.
The event resumed in 2023 after state officials and Osage leaders compromised to allow caroling in an aboveground auditorium instead of the underground Cathedral Room, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Blanchard-Springs-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 19:57:40.173667

(Pool photo by Francisco Kjolseth/The Salt Lake Tribune) The Utah judge who has caught the ire of many Utah Republican lawmakers for her repeated rulings against them in the state’s yearslong redistricting legal battle issued a legal analysis Friday explaining why she has denied lawmakers’ request to push pause on the state’s new court-ordered congressional map. 
In her 11-page decision, 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson wrote she rejected the Utah Legislature’s preferred map C because it not only failed to adhere to neutral map-drawing criteria under Proposition 4 (a 2018 voter-approved ballot initiative that created an independent redistricting process) to the greatest extent practicable, but also because it was drawn with political data — which is also a violation of Proposition 4. 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

“The undisputed evidence presented in this case showed that the Legislative Defendants’ own expert, Dr. Sean Trende, exclusively used (Dave’s Redistricting Application) when he was drawing Map C and that partisan data was displayed on the screen during the map-drawing process,” Gibson wrote. 
“Even by the Legislature’s own professed standards and course of conduct Map C should have been rejected by the Legislative Redistricting Committee because Dr. Trende used DRA to create it,” she continued, adding that “none of these facts were disputed during the evidentiary hearings” and that the Legislature’s attorneys “failed to show that the Court clearly erred in making these findings.” 
Ultimately, Gibson found the Legislature’s map C — which would have created four safe Republican districts — was an “extreme partisan gerrymander” that violated Proposition 4 by “both unduly and purposefully favoring” the Republican party “at the expense of minority voters,” Democrats. 
“The Legislative Defendants fail to address, let alone show, that the Court erred in making these findings,” she wrote. 
Gibson also wrote that the Legislature’s requests — both for a stay on the new congressional map and requests for Gibson to reconsider all of her previous rulings — were “procedurally improper.”

“They argue this relief is justified because the Court’s previous rulings are unconstitutional, they have effectively been denied the opportunity to appeal, and the Court has no authority over the remedial process,” she wrote, but she rejected those arguments for multiple reasons. 
Among them was that when the Legislature failed to enact a map that complied with Proposition 4, Gibson “was required to consider the only other maps submitted to the court — those submitted by the plaintiffs — and determine if they comply with Proposition 4.” 
The judge ultimately decided that the plaintiffs’ Map 1, which creates a Democratic-leaning district in the northern part of Salt Lake County, best complied with Proposition 4’s criteria. 
Court’s authority to pick a map ‘rooted firmly in the law’
Gibson wrote that the court’s “authority to adopt a lawful congressional map — where the Legislature’s Map C fails to comply with Proposition 4 — is rooted firmly in the law.” 
After previously agreeing to participate in the court-ordered process, the Legislature “cannot now assert that the Court lacked authority to preside over the remedial proceedings.” 
“Now, for the first time and despite the plain language of the stipulation that contemplates this exact possibility, the Legislative Defendants contend that this Court only had the authority to enjoin Map C, but not to adopt a remedial,” Gibson wrote. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

The judge asserted that the court-ordered congressional map “does not exceed the ordinary bounds of judicial review and does not violate separation of powers,” as lawmakers have repeatedly argued. 
She pointed to the previous U.S. Supreme Court rulings and proceedings in other states like Florida that have selected and affirmed remedial maps proposed by plaintiffs after the state legislature’s maps were found to violate the state’s ban on partisan favoritism. 
“While a state court’s role in redistricting is new to Utah, this judicial function is neither new nor novel,” Gibson wrote. “It is well settled that when the political branches fail to enact lawful electoral maps, the judiciary’s duty to provide an effective remedy is not discretionary.”
Instead, Gibson wrote the courts “have a fundamental obligation to uphold constitutional rights and to ensure a lawful electoral map is in place, including by adopting one proposed by a party in the proceedings.” 
“This authority is firmly rooted in both federal and state court precedent,” she wrote. “Without the court’s remedial power, the right to vote could be rendered illusory and the constitutional guarantee of free and lawful elections would go unfulfilled.”
Allegations that timing was intentional are ‘unfounded,’ judge says
In her analysis, Gibson also addressed lawmakers’ public criticisms of her handling of the case — including allegations that the timing of her ruling (which came at 11:41 p.m. on the last possible day state elections officials had set to choose a new congressional map, Nov. 10) was intentional to undermine lawmakers’ ability to appeal. 
“Any suggestion that this Court delayed issuing any ruling to force compliance with the remedial process or to preclude an appeal is unfounded,” Gibson wrote. 
Utah Legislature’s special session will tackle redistricting, repeal public union bill

She added that a “simple review” of the court docket and past hearings shows she “invited discussion” and input from all of the parties involved in the lawsuit to set the court-ordered redistricting process’ schedule — which legislative attorneys agreed to.
“While no Utah court has engaged in a remedial process related to redistricting, both counsel indicated that they have litigated against each other in other states and are familiar with these types of remedial procedure,” Gibson wrote. “As a result, the Court requested the Lieutenant Governor’s office set the deadline and respectfully requested as much time as possible for the parties and the Court.”
Gibson also noted that she extended deadlines for the lawsuit’s parties “at every opportunity,” including requests for additional time made by the Legislature’s attorneys. She noted the complex case was complicated further by lawmakers’ attempts to enact a new law, HB1011 (which she ultimately blocked) that would have required Utah’s new congressional map to pass a set of prescriptive statistical tests that plaintiffs successfully argued would have resulted in a map that favored Republicans. 
Ultimately, Gibson was left with only six days to finalize what turned out to be an 89-page ruling on a complex case. 
“This Court did not intentionally delay any decision to foreclose the Legislative Defendants’ appeal rights or force them to participate in the remedial process,” she wrote. “Any such assertion is simply not supported by the record in this case.”

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington state Sen. Rebecca Saldaña said Monday she would run for an open seat on the King County Council and forgo reelection to the state Senate. 
“This will be my last legislative session as a State Senator,” Saldaña said in a text message Monday afternoon.
Rep. Chipalo Street, D-Seattle, will run to replace her in the 37th Legislative District. He said running “would be very interesting.”
“Now that she’s made it official, I’m happy to make it official,” he said Monday. “I have the session to worry about, but I will take the steps to declare and file before the session even happens.”
The 37th District covers south Seattle neighborhoods like Beacon Hill, the Central District, Rainier Valley, Columbia City and the city of Renton. 
Saldaña is aiming to replace newly elected King County Executive Girmay Zahilay on the County Council. Zahilay has chosen three options to replace him on the council until voters weigh in on a permanent successor next year. The council is expected to choose the temporary seatholder Tuesday.
Saldaña, who chairs the Labor and Commerce Committee, has been a leading voice in the Legislature on worker and immigrant rights. She joined the Legislature in 2016, upon appointment by the King County Council when then-state Sen. Pramila Jayapal won election to Congress.
Before that, she was executive director of Puget Sound Sage, an advocacy organization focused on racial justice, the climate and the economy.
Saldaña previously ran to be the state’s commissioner of public lands, but dropped out before a packed Democratic primary amid a cancer diagnosis and fundraising woes. During that run, Street and his seatmate, Rep. Sharon Tomiko Santos, D-Seattle, discussed who might run to replace Saldaña if she won. They agreed it should be Street, he said.
Street, a Microsoft program manager who joined the Legislature in 2023, has focused on changing the state’s regressive tax structure while in Olympia. 
This year, for example, he led a House effort on the controversial “wealth tax.” His bill made no progress, but another version passed the Senate in a largely symbolic move on the final day of this year’s session. The proposal, which targets taxpayers holding sizable amounts of assets like stocks and bonds, is expected to be a hot topic again in 2026 with another budget shortfall to grapple with.
Saldaña is the second Democratic senator to announce she won’t run for reelection in as many as weeks. Sen. Sharon Shewmake, D-Bellingham, said last week she will serve through her term, but won’t run next year to retain her seat. 
Both Democratic representatives from Shewmake’s district have said they’re not interested in running for the upper chamber. A local Democratic port commissioner announced his run Monday.

(Photo by Laura Guido/Idaho Capital Sun) An influential conservative think tank is urging the Idaho Legislature to cut Medicaid expansion, public school funding and other programs to balance the state budget. 
Idaho is projected to face a between a $600 million and $1 billion budget deficit in fiscal year 2027, which begins July 1. It is already facing a roughly $58 million deficit in the current fiscal year. 
Idaho may need to find $600 million to $1 billion for next year’s state budget

Leaders from the Idaho Freedom Foundation — a nonprofit organization that scores legislators based on their votes and frequently lobbies on bills — said Monday at a press conference at the Capitol building in Boise the state’s problems were “self-inflicted.” 
“Idaho does not have a budget problem,” Idaho Freedom Foundation President Ron Nate said. “We have a budgeting problem.” 
The organization, known as IFF, called for nearly $1.9 billion in cuts to the state budget next year, including state general funds, dedicated funds and federal money. 
Nate emphasized that the problem wasn’t from the several income tax cuts or rebates approved in the last five years, which the Idaho Fiscal Policy Center estimated to have reduced revenue by a total of $4 billion dollars.
The speakers Monday blamed the deficit on increased spending amid the influx of federal pandemic relief funds since 2020. In 2022, the state ended the fiscal year with a record $1.4 billion surplus. 
Fred Birnbaum, IFF senior policy fellow, said revenue has continued to grow despite the tax cuts. He said the state could support more cuts if it constrained its spending. 
 Cutting Medicaid expansion central to IFF’s budget proposal 

The biggest cut proposed would be to eliminate Idaho’s Medicaid expansion program. Idaho voters in 2018 approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid eligibility to adults who earned too much to qualify for traditional Medicaid but not enough for premium credits to afford private coverage through the state health insurance marketplace. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare in fiscal year 2026 had requested around $1.3 billion from all funding sources to fund the program; the services are 90% covered by the federal government and the state covers the remaining 10%. 
As of October, which is three months into the fiscal year, the program had spent around $339 million from all funds, which was around 4% less than was budgeted for, according to the agency’s most recent Medicaid budget report. 
There have been multiple efforts in the Legislature to repeal the program, which covered about 85,000 Idahoans as of Nov. 14. Those who support its repeal said the program is too expensive. Many of those who opposed repeal have said that uninsured people delaying care and ending up in emergency rooms would result in even higher costs. Previous funds to cover indigent care were eliminated upon approval of Medicaid expansion. 
The group also called for an additional $100.5 million in cuts to Idaho Health and Welfare, or a 15% cut from the agency’s prior year budget.

 Group calls for $166 million cut in Idaho public school spending

Gov. Brad Little in September called for state agencies nearly across the board to permanently cut their budgets by 3%, but he exempted K-12 public schools. 
IFF leaders on Monday said that the K-12 budget should be held to the same cutbacks, and proposed a $166.5 million cut to the state’s public school support budget. 
“If we’re really in a fiscal deficit, we should be cutting back across all agencies and programs,” said Brett Farruggia, IFF policy analyst. “There should be no exemptions from any agency or program, especially unmerited ones.” 
The group also asked for the repeal of Idaho Launch, a $75 million grant program for graduating high school seniors to use toward university and college tuition or work training and apprenticeships in in-demand fields. 
The IFF leaders did not recommend cutting the $50 million private school choice tax credit, which allows state money to go to parents for private education, including private school tuition. 
The group asked for various other cuts to agencies, targeting especially ones that have grown more quickly. 
A handful of legislators attended Monday’s press conference. Ultimately, lawmakers and the state budget writers on the Joint Finance-Appropriations Committee will decide how to balance the budget for next year. The legislative session will begin Jan. 12.

Michelle Lujan Grisham asking her to include public safety matters on the upcoming legislative session’s agenda.,"Bernalillo County Sheriff John Allen speaks before the New Mexico GOP-led Public Safety Legislative Task Force on Dec. 1, 2025. (Courtesy of Public Safety Legislative Task Force)Republicans in the New Mexico Legislature on Monday sent a letter to Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham asking her to include public safety matters on the upcoming legislative session’s agenda.
The 30-day session scheduled for January is for lawmakers to propose and vote on fiscal matters. If lawmakers want to file bills unrelated to the budget, the matter must be on the governor’s legislative agenda, known as a “call,” for the session.
“Over the past several years, your administration has taken steps to support law enforcement, strengthen behavioral-health resources, and address some of the complex drivers of crime. Unfortunately, the progressive-controlled Legislature has failed to advance substantial, commonsense solutions to New Mexico’s crime epidemic,” the letter, signed by Rep. Andrea Reeb (R-Clovis) and Sen. Crystal Brantley (R-Elephant Butte), said.
Jodi McGinnis Porter, a spokesperson for the governor, told Source NM that Lujan Grisham is out of town and has not yet reviewed the letter. But, public safety will be on the call for the 2026 legislative session, she said.
“The governor has consistently prioritized this issue, as demonstrated by her recent declarations of emergencies in Albuquerque and Española and her previous declarations addressing gun violence and the drug crisis,” she wrote in an email to Source. “She welcomes collaboration with legislators from both parties who share her commitment to keeping New Mexicans safe.”
The Republicans’ request comes one week after the governor’s senior public safety adviser attended an event for the New Mexico GOP-led Public Safety Legislative Task Force, at which he told lawmakers that a New Mexican child or teenager is arrested while possessing a firearm three out of four days. 
The task force subsequently issued on Monday a 35-page report titled “A State in Crisis: Confronting New Mexico’s Crime Epidemic and Restoring Public Safety,” which lays out several legislative priorities Republicans hope to pursue in the upcoming session.
The report contains proposals to:

Expand the definition of “fentanyl” in state law to include “fentanyl-related substances”
Establish a “clear and convincing” burden of proof for a judge to decrease a criminal sentence
Create a minimum period of incarceration for people facing a second, or subsequent, felony conviction
Create a minimum period of incarceration for drug trafficking that results in death
Allow prosecuting attorneys to seek enhancements to criminal sentences for prior felony convictions beyond the current 10-year window allowed under state law
Increase penalties for distributing Schedule 1 or 2 narcotics or methamphetamine to children
Increase penalties for a felon in possession of a firearm
Create statutory requirements for the New Mexico All Source Intelligence Center, including requirements to provide threat management and community engagement resources across the state
Shift burden to the defendant, rather than prosecutors, on issues of bail reform and release from jail
Create a constitution provision to return property taxes paid by someone whose property was damaged “by a county or municipality’s failure to enforce their nuisance ordinances”

Likewise, two Democrat lawmakers recently said they’d ask the governor to include public safety matters on the upcoming session’s agenda. Rep. Andrea Romero (D-Santa Fe) and Sen. Heather Berghmans (D-Albuquerque) last week announced their plans to propose legislation that would require intensive training for firearms dealers across the state.
Lujan Grisham has focused intensely on public safety in recent years. In 2023, she called on lawmakers to pass a ban on assault rifles and in 2024 she called firearm legislation “the most important work” before New Mexico’s elected leaders. 
She called a special legislative session last year to address “urgent public safety issues.” At the time, she requested legislative proposals on criminal competency, crime reporting, gun violence, drug overdoses and more. The special session adjourned after a matter of hours without any such bills.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/KEC5800-Edit-copy-2-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 18:58:55.166539

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)In an effort to reduce delays associated with road construction, the Montana Department of Transportation is taking public comment on new rules for utility companies that need to relocate pipes, lines and cables to make room for state projects.
The proposed rules follow the passage of House Bill 672, brought by Rep. Courtenay Sprunger, a Kalispell Republican, this past Legislative session. Contractors, the Department of Transportation and utility companies worked together on language for the legislation.
Utility relocation during road projects can be slow, and the new rules seek to set clear expectations for companies.
“The proposed rule sets consistent standards for notifying facility owners, firm deadlines for relocation, clear guidelines for handling delays or noncompliance, and explains penalties when moves aren’t completed on time,” the proposed rules say.
Sprunger said the process for the bill was how legislation should work and complimented the process. The legislation passed through both chambers with no votes against and was signed by Gov. Greg Gianforte days after the 2025 session ended. 
“To have these folks, sit down around the table and instead of pointing fingers, say, ‘This is my part, and here’s how I think we can collaborate to make this better,’ that’s how we got to the final product … that’s powerful,” Sprunger said in an interview on Monday.
It’s been a long running issue — decades, Sprunger said — and includes multiple, sometimes cascading problems.
Sprunger said there was a project that sat for six weeks in the middle of the summer and used it to illustrate the issue the legislation and proposed rules are trying to solve.
The contractor for the project doesn’t know when the utility company is going to make the move, and the people on the road work can’t really be moved. In this way, it’s a labor issue too, Sprunger explained, as those same workers will be needed at the site when the utility company completes its work. 
These delays cause risk for contractors, she said, making things more expensive and can also push projects into the next construction season. Montana’s weather plays a part too, as precipitation and cold also can be a factor.
“It ultimately solves the time is money problem,” Sprunger said. “From a practical standpoint, the longer it goes, the more it costs. You’re talking about more risk for a contractor if it’s unpredictable when the utilities are able to get in there and move their utilities, which has to happen before that roadway can be reconstructed or redesigned.”
The state reimburses utility companies 75% of the cost for them to relocate when they’re impacted by a state transportation project, MDT’s chief engineer, Dustin Rouse, said in an interview last week.
“This bill puts a little more pressure on the utilities to complete those relocations in a timely manner, so we don’t have contractors out there waiting trying to get utilities moved, and the public is inconvenienced,” Rouse said.
Importantly, though, he added, the bill and proposed rules are also guidelines for how MDT will operate, too.
“It also holds MDT accountable to making sure that we give early notification to the utilities,” Rouse said.
The proposed rules say a written notice for relocation will be issued that allows a “reasonable amount” of time for relocation, which the rules say will be no less than 90 days. That’s “in addition to the 90 days following the preliminary notice” the proposed rules say.
There is a penalty for not cooperating and a rule allowing for utility companies to get an extension to complete the move if something goes wrong.
A hearing for the proposed rule is set for 10 a.m,. Friday, and public comment is being taken until 5 p.m., Dec. 19.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RoadClosedStock-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-12-08 18:58:55.166539

(Chase Woodruff/Colorado Newsline)A federal magistrate judge in Colorado on Monday dismissed former Mesa County clerk Tina Peters’ petition for a writ of habeas corpus, one of several long-shot legal maneuvers Peters’ attorneys and allies in the election-denial movement have sought to use to secure her release from state prison.
Peters is serving a nine-year sentence for her role in a breach of her office’s election systems, part of an attempt to find evidence of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. She has appealed her August 2024 conviction in state court, arguing that her imprisonment violates her First Amendment right of free speech, and separately filed a habeas corpus petition in federal court, seeking her release on bond while the state appeal is pending.
Scott T. Varholak, chief magistrate judge of the U.S. District Court of Colorado, wrote in a 12-page order that Peters had raised “important constitutional questions concerning whether the trial court improperly punished her more severely because of her protected First Amendment speech.” But in dismissing her petition, he sided with arguments made in the federal case by the Colorado attorney general’s office, which cited longstanding precedent against “federal court interference with state court proceedings.”

“Because Ms. Peters’ appeal remains pending in state court, where she argues that the trial court violated her First Amendment rights by punishing her based upon her speech, any First Amendment error can be corrected through the state appeal,” Varholak wrote.
“Because this question remains pending before Colorado courts, this Court must abstain from answering that question until after the Colorado courts have decided the issue,” he added.
Peters’ petition was dismissed without prejudice, meaning it could be filed again at a later date.
President Donald Trump, senior officials in his administration and a host of far-right media figures have stepped up their campaign for Peters’ release in recent weeks. In a series of filings in the habeas corpus case, Peters’ attorneys have stated that she is in “declining health” and alleged that she had been temporarily placed in solitary confinement after objecting to a corrections officer’s treatment of her.
On Nov. 12, at the urging of Office of Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche, the Federal Bureau of Prisons sent a letter to the Colorado Department of Corrections requests Peters’ transfer “for the purpose of serving a state-imposed sentence within a federal correctional institution.” The DOC and Gov. Jared Polis have affirmed that they are not seeking such a transfer.
Trump does not have the power to pardon Peters, who was convicted on state charges. Despite this, her attorney, Peter Ticktin, said last week that he has submitted an application for a presidential pardon of Peters, arguing in a subsequent letter that the president “has the power to grant a pardon in any of the states of the United States.” Such an outcome would violate centuries of legal consensus and the longstanding dual-sovereignty doctrine that the U.S. Supreme Court upheld in criminal matters as recently as 2019.
In an appearance on longtime Trump ally Steve Bannon’s podcast last month, Ticktin also said he thinks the Trump administration should use the U.S. military to free Peters from the Colorado prison by force.
Trump himself has repeatedly called on Polis to “free” Peters, most recently in a Dec. 3 social media post in which Trump wrote that the governor “refuses to allow an elderly woman, Tina Peters, who was unfairly convicted of what the Democrats do, cheating on Elections, out of jail!” In August, he threatened “harsh measures” if Peters wasn’t released.
Claims that the 2020 election was fraudulent or compromised have been debunked by elections officials, experts, media investigations, law enforcement, the courts and Trump’s own campaign and administration officials.

Critics say it would lower standards.,"Supporters say the bill would eliminate just one of many tests students take to gauge their proficiency. Critics say the move would lower standards. (Photo by Alexander Castro)High school juniors could see a test required for graduation eliminated under a bill approved by the Assembly Monday.
The bill to eliminate the test, which is called the New Jersey Graduation Proficiency Assessment, passed 55-17. Supporters called the exam just one of many tests high schoolers are forced to take before graduation, while several Republicans said the measure would lower educational standards. 
“Do not hand out a diploma disconnected from proficiency. I think it’s a huge error,” said Assemblywoman Dawn Fantasia (R-Sussex). “Students in New Jersey can do it — our policy cannot reflect that they can’t.”
NJ bill that would mandate school mergers gets mixed reception

Fantasia said students who are about to enter the workforce or pursue higher education should be held to a high standard, and she claimed employers are already seeing a decline in the readiness of entry-level employees.
“If anything, we’re going to widen the gap between the diploma we hand them and their actual preparedness,” she said.
Assemblywoman Aura Dunn (R-Morris) said she understands the argument that a single test is not the perfect tool to determine whether a student is ready to graduate. But Dunn said eliminating it without a replacement only solves half of the problem.
“If we are serious about improving outcomes, then we must be serious about accountability. We cannot fix what we refuse to measure,” she said.
Gov. Phil Murphy in 2022 signed a law waiving the test requirement in the 2022-2023 school year, and lawmakers have subsequently tried to make that permanent.
Bill sponsor Assemblywoman Michele Matsikoudis (R-Union) said the data collected from the test doesn’t meaningfully reflect students’ learning, and she noted that other states have moved away from requiring students to pass a standardized test to graduate.
“New Jersey already gathers extensive student performance data through a multitude of other, more informative assessments and graduation standards,” she said. “This exam adds very little insight.”
Assemblywoman Rosy Bagolie (D-Essex) said her son, who sat next to her during Monday’s voting session, failed the math portion of the exam, graduated high school after passing the PSATs, and then finished his first semester of college with a 4.0 grade point average.
“Exit exams do not measure readiness for college, careers, or life. They measure testing under pressure,” said Bagolie, the superintendent of East Newark’s school district. “These exams disproportionately harm students with disabilities, multi-lingual learners, students from low-income families, many of whom have met every graduation requirement only to be blocked by one single exam.”
A companion bill was introduced in the Senate in January 2024, but it has yet to be scheduled for a hearing before the chamber’s education committee. The Legislature has until Jan. 13 to pass any bills under consideration before a new session begins.

Free.,Trump to send $12 billion in one-time payments to farmers to offset ag losses,Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/trump-send-12-billion-one-time-payments-farmers-offset-ag-losses,,"The federal government will provide $12 billion to U.S. farmers who have been hurt by “unfair market disruption,” President Donald Trump said at a White House roundtable event Monday.Trump said repeatedly the funding was available thanks to tariff revenues, framing his aggressive trade policy as a boon to farmers rather than a drag on their global market share as critics of the policy suggest. “I'm delighted to announce this afternoon that the United States will be taking a small portion of the hundreds of billions of dollars we receive in tariffs…  and we're going to be giving and providing it to the farmers in economic assistance,” Trump said.U.S. Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins, though, told reporters following the event that the money came from the department’s Commodity Credit Corporation, which is funded through regular appropriations from Congress, according to a White House pool report.The money, which the administration officials described as “bridge payments,” would be in farmers’ hands by the end of February, Rollins said. While not officially marketed as a part of a series of Trump events spotlighting affordability issues, the president said several times he was addressing an affordability crisis he “inherited” from President Joe Biden, a Democrat.“The Democrats cause the affordability problem,” Trump said. “And we're the ones that are fixing it.” The bulk of the funding, $11 billion, would go to row crop farmers who grow barley, chickpeas, corn, cotton, lentils, oats, peanuts, peas, rice, sorghum, soybeans, wheat, canola, crambe, flax, mustard, rapeseed, safflower, sesame and sunflower, according to a USDA statement. The department was planning to reserve $1 billion for unnamed specialty crops, Rollins said.Payments to arrive before GOP law kicks inTrump, Rollins and other Cabinet-level officials said the payments were to be used as a “bridge” before policies enacted in Republicans’ massive spending and tax cuts law this year are implemented.“This bridge is absolutely necessary based on where we are right now,” Rollins said.They blamed the Biden administration for a more negative outlook for farmers. Biden failed to close trade deals and a focus on environmental policy led to increased costs for the agriculture industry, they said.The package limits payments to $155,000 per recipient, USDA Undersecretary for Farm Production and Conservation Richard Fordyce told reporters on a conference call late Monday afternoon.Iowa farmer Cordt Holub spoke at the White House event, where he thanked Trump for the package.“I want to say thank you for this bridge payment,” he said. “It's Christmas early for farmers.”Louisiana rice farmer Meryl Kennedy said the industry was struggling, but thanked Trump for the aid funding and changes to reference prices in the Republican megabill. “Our farmers can feed this nation and many nations abroad, but we need fair trade, not free trade,” she said. Tariff impact ignoredBut they did not mention the effects of tariffs, which critics of the president have said are responsible for diminishing agricultural exports and hurting farmers’ bottom lines.House Agriculture Committee ranking Democrat Angie Craig of Minnesota said in a statement the package “picks winners and losers in the farm economy,” and would not provide certainty to farmers or reduce high operational costs.“It will not bring U.S. agricultural exports back to pre-trade war levels,” she said. “It also ignores (the) fact that the president’s tariffs are responsible for the immense financial strain felt not just by America’s farmers, but also working people, manufacturers, retailers and small businesses. All Americans are tired of the affordability crisis created by this administration and congressional Republicans. We will be right back here a year from now unless the administration changes its policies.”Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, also slammed the program.“The reason farmers need relief at all is largely because Donald Trump betrayed them and decimated their businesses with his disastrous tariffs,” Schumer said in a floor speech Monday. “Now, Donald Trump is patting himself on the back, acting like a hero to farmers while using taxpayer dollars to clean up the mess he created. It’s textbook Donald Trump incompetence.”Another round?Asked by a reporter during the roundtable if he would be open to another round of relief for farmers, Trump said it would depend on how international trade develops and said farmers would not want further aid.“It depends on where we go,” he said. “China is buying a lot. Other countries are buying a lot. And you know, the interesting thing about the farmers, they don't want aid. They want to just have a level playing field.”He later indicated it would be unnecessary.“We're going to make the farmers so strong — and I'm not even talking about financially, because they just want to be able to produce what they can produce,” he said. “We're going to make them so strong that it will be, indeed, a golden age for farmers.”Rollins told reporters following the event that Trump was “open to more.”",,,,2025-12-08 18:58:55.166539

The move came as a surprise to the attorneys for plaintiffs who were initially scheduled to make their case for a temporary restraining order before Rhode Island Judge Mary S. McElroy. 
“It feels like intentional chaos,” McElroy said.
In a message to Continuum of Care networks, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced Monday afternoon that officials rescinded its Nov. 13 Notice of Funding Opportunity for federal fiscal 2025 grants to “make appropriate revisions.” The notice had set Jan. 14 as the deadline for applications for Continuum of Care funds, which address homelessness.
Rhode Island’s Continuum of Care gave the state’s homeless care a deadline of Dec. 12 to get their applications done to give to HUD, according to one of the lawsuits.
“We received notice first through our providers and [electronic filing], not through opposing counsel,” Zane Muller, assistant attorney general for the state of Washington, said during the 25-minute virtual hearing that began at 3:30 p.m.
HUD’s policy rescission too was news for McElroy, who called it a “haphazard approach to administrative law.” 
“There’s a process and procedure that’s laid out,” said McElroy, a first-term Trump appointee. “It’s not by tweets or by last-minute orders or last-minute withdrawals.”
Pardis Gheibi, a U.S. Department of Justice attorney representing HUD, told McElroy the notice was filed with the court as soon as it was published. She did not have the answer when McElroy wanted to know who at HUD made the decision to rescind the funding notice and when.
“We didn’t have the chance to confer with plaintiffs’ counsel — but the rescission happened this afternoon,” Gheibi said.
The Trump administration had planned to slash the amount of grant funds that can be spent on permanent housing — subsidized units that provide a stable residence for formerly homeless people, often those who have experienced mental illness or spent years on the streets — and instead focus on transitional housing.










There’s a process and procedure that’s laid out. It’s not by tweets or by last-minute orders or last-minute withdrawals.


– Rhode Island U.S. District Court Judge Mary S. McElroy


Grant rules also would have eliminated funding for diversity and inclusion efforts, support of transgender clients and use of “harm reduction” strategies that seek to reduce overdose deaths by helping people in active addiction use drugs more safely.
HUD wrote in its update that it still intends to make changes to the policy for awarding funds for addressing homelessness.
A coalition of states co-led by Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha filed suit over HUD’s latest Notice of Funding Opportunity on Nov. 25. On Dec. 1, a group of cities and nonprofits led by the National Alliance to End Homelessness and the National Low Income Housing Coalition filed a separate 85-page lawsuit.
Both complaints had similar requests for the court to declare the new conditions unlawful and reinstate language from prior funding notices, which is why McElroy opted to combine them into one hearing.
But with the funding notice now withdrawn, Gheibi argued there was no need for immediate relief.
Kristin Bateman, an attorney representing local communities and nonprofits and a senior counsel with Democracy Forward, argued court action is still needed. She said HUD’s rescission still leaves a critical funding gap for homeless services starting early next year since most federal fiscal 2024 grants start to expire in January.
“Those gaps in funding mean that they will not have the money to continue supporting the permanent housing that they fund for people to live in,” Bateman said. “People are going to be displaced, put back into homelessness in the middle of winter and face all the harms that come with that.”
McElroy scheduled the next hearing for 10 a.m. Friday, Dec. 19. She also tasked HUD with producing the administrative record on the grant funding policy, ideally within a week — though Gheibi had asked if it could wait until after the holidays.
McElroy said if the administration could work quickly to rescind the funding notice, they can work quickly to give the court the documents she requested.
“People can work overtime if they need to,” McElroy said. “I do, they do, I’m sure you do.”

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)The Arkansas Department of Human Services needs to reduce its rate of erroneous nutrition benefit payments in order to minimize the cost of the program in the coming years, DHS officials and state lawmakers agreed Monday.
The federal One Big, Beautiful Bill Act extended a series of tax cuts by reducing several benefit programs, including the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). States will have to share some of the cost of the program for the first time in the program’s 86-year history, and each state’s share will depend on how often it overpays or underpays SNAP benefits.
The law incentivizes states to keep their error rates below 6% in order for the federal government to continue to pay 100% of the cost of SNAP benefits. States with error rates above 6% will pay at least 5% of SNAP benefit costs starting in fiscal year 2028, which begins Oct. 1, 2027.
Arkansas’ current error rate is 7.01%, DHS Division of County Operations Director Mary Franklin told the Joint Public Health, Welfare and Labor Committee Monday. The rate has decreased by 0.28% since July, when the Advocate calculated that the most expensive potential outcome of the cost-shifting would be just over $100 million based on the rate at the time.
The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act’s changes to SNAP could hit Arkansas’ already-dwindling surplus

Franklin said the state’s error rate in October 2024 was 9.56%, so the state has been “making improvements” and will work to bring the rate down further.
“We have reached out to other states that have lower error rates to inquire what they are doing [and] how they are doing things differently to see if there’s a process or a procedure that we are not doing or paying attention to,” DHS Secretary Janet Mann told the committee.
The two most common areas of error in calculating SNAP benefits are in recording recipients’ income and calculating shelter deductions for homeless households, Franklin said.
Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett (Courtesy of the Arkansas Secretary of State)
Rep. Howard Beaty, R-Crossett, asked if errors are more frequently the responsibility of SNAP recipients providing their information or DHS employees recording it.
Franklin said there are more “agency errors than client errors.” Beaty called it “a huge problem that we need to address, because in the end, it’s going to cost the state money.”
More than 222,000 Arkansas individuals and over 118,000 households received SNAP benefits as of Sept. 1, according to DHS. Arkansas usually receives roughly $41 million in SNAP funds per month, Mann told the Joint Public Health committee in November.
Regardless of error rates, all states’ share of the administrative cost of SNAP will increase from 50% to 75% in October 2026.
Democrats in Congress have expressed concerns that some states will cut SNAP benefits in their efforts to comply with the new program requirements.
The One Big, Beautiful Bill Act also requires non-disabled adults without dependents up to the age of 64 to work in order to receive SNAP benefits unless they are exempted due to disability, substance abuse disorder treatment or attending school. The requirement is to work a minimum of 30 hours per week or earn the equivalent of minimum wage for at least 20 hours per week.

The head of the Vermont Democratic Party is calling on Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos to resign after VTDigger published a story Monday in which sexual assault survivors criticized her handling of their cases and described ethics complaints filed against her.
“Eva Vekos is unfit to serve as State’s Attorney, and she should resign from her office immediately — as a majority of Addison County legislators called for last year, even before the latest ethics complaints and allegations of bullying crime victims came to light,” Vermont Democratic Party Chair Lachlan Francis said in a statement Monday afternoon. 
If Vekos decides to seek reelection to another four-year term, Francis added, the party would not support her candidacy.

“She will not have access to our resources or infrastructure, and we will work to recruit and support a strong primary opponent,” Francis said in the statement. “Addison County deserves law enforcement leaders capable of holding the public’s trust, and that will never be Eva Vekos.”
VTDigger’s Monday story described Vekos’ conduct that led to two formal ethics complaints filed against her regarding her treatment of sexual assault survivors. 
In a statement to VTDigger late Monday afternoon, Vekos, a Democrat, challenged the allegations made against her and criticized the state Democratic Party.
“The Democratic Party doesn’t know anything about me or the successes of my office,” Vekos said in the email. “They have never shown any interest in the work of the criminal court in Addison. So their opinion means little to me.”
Political leaders have called for Vekos’ resignation before. Following her arrest for alleged drunken driving in January 2024, several lawmakers called for her to step down, though she did not. Vekos is up for reelection in November 2026.
Vekos was arrested on a drunken driving charge after she allegedly drove to a suspicious death investigation in Bridport intoxicated. She has since pleaded not guilty to that charge, which remains pending.
Since Vekos’s arrest, detectives with the Vermont State Police New Haven barracks in Addison County have sent cases they investigate to the Vermont Attorney General’s office, rather than Vekos’ office, to avoid a conflict of interest.

Rep. Sharon Henderson, a Covington Democrat whose district spans a western portion of Newton County, was charged with two counts of theft of government funds and 10 counts of making false statements.
Henderson was scheduled to appear before U.S. Magistrate Judge Justin Anand on Monday afternoon. She did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
The program, which was established by Congress in 2020, provided cash assistance to those experiencing unemployment as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Applicants were required to submit weekly certifications providing the reason they were unemployed and stating that they were actively looking for work. 
Prosecutors say Henderson applied for the program during June 2020, when she was a candidate for the Georgia House of Representatives, falsely claiming that she had been an employee of the Henry County School District in 2019 and 2020, and was laid off due to the pandemic. 
In reality, authorities say Henderson had only spent five days working for Henry County Schools as a substitute teacher in 2018, and had not worked there since. Additionally, the substitute teaching contract she signed included an acknowledgement that she was not eligible for unemployment benefits.
Henderson allegedly submitted eight certifications in June 2021, after she was sworn in as an elected official.

Blocking public access is legal, but has been a point of contention for decades.
The post Jackson Hole cyclist resuscitates 40-year debate over public access to Snake River levees appeared first on WyoFile .","JACKSON—A longtime Teton County resident is resuscitating a decades-long debate over public access to levees on the Snake River.
When Scott Bradley moved to Jackson 23 years ago, he could ride his bike up and down the levees on the west bank of the Snake River, all the way up to Snake River Ranch. Then, he started to see construction along the river. As new homes went up, so did gates.
“It ruined my favorite Jackson Hole activity,” Bradley said. “It killed the most healthy, soul-shaping activity I had in my daily routine.”
Bradley has been reaching out to county officials and nonprofit groups to see what can be done to open the levees to the public.
In a town where many residents don’t lock their bikes, cars and homes, the gates can come as a surprise. The proliferation of gates is perplexing even to those who maintain the levees.
“For whatever reason, some of your county inhabitants don’t like people walking in front of them,” said Kenny Koebberling, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ Jackson levee project manager.
Property owners putting up gates on the levees is unambiguously legal, though the phenomenon has been a matter of consternation for some since the 1980s. The levees are public infrastructure — in that Teton County and the Army Corps maintain them using tax dollars — but often they are on private property.
That explanation isn’t satisfying to some. In 2025, the Corps’ budget for Snake levee maintenance is $357,000, of which Teton County must pay $117,000. Building and maintaining the levees has cost tens of millions of dollars — if not hundreds of millions, when adjusted for inflation — over the years.
“To exclude the public from a facility that the public paid to be built and paid to maintain, that’s a bad deal,” said Teton County Commissioner Len Carlman.
But those who support private property rights on the levees say that, even gated, the levees serve the public good by preventing Wilson from flooding. That, they argue, is what taxpayers are paying for.
“It doesn’t only protect the homeowners that are there,” Koebberling said. “Everything on the west side is protected by those levees, pretty much.”
While property owners have been putting gates up on the levees for more than 40 years, it has picked up in the last decade or so.
It ruined my favorite Jackson Hole activity.Scott Bradley
“In the ‘60s, anybody could drive anywhere on those levees,” Koebberling said. “In general, as the parcels have been sold off and subdivided, more people are wanting to restrict access.”
Koebberling and Tony Havel, manager of the county’s Road and Levee Department, said the northwest stretch of levees has the highest concentration of gates. A reporter counted 10 gates in the 7-mile stretch of levees from the Wilson Boat Ramp upstream to the Snake River Ranch during a ride-along with Road and Levee.
The southeast side also is gated near Highway 22. A subdivision on the southwest levee, however, has decided that it is okay with public use of the levee, leading to about 2.5 miles of public access. The northeast portion of the levee has public access on U.S. Bureau of Land Management parcels.
A levee is born
There are 33 miles of federally managed levees on the Snake. The federal government originally built the levees to protect ranch land, of which not much remains. The government obtained easements from landowners for construction, which took place between 1962 and 1964. The county and the Army Corps have easements to maintain them.
The levees created buildable land that was once floodplain. Before the levees, some people grazed cattle by the river, but no one was particularly concerned about ownership.
“Before they built the levees, people didn’t really care too much,” said Rich Greenwood, who built Teton County’s original GIS. “Then all of a sudden there was a whole bunch of land that could be developed.”
Litigation began shortly thereafter and continued for almost 20 years.
In the West, the “thread” — or center line — of the river is traditionally the boundary line for riverside properties. This concept, known as riparian law, meant that even if the river naturally meandered away from a property, a landowner wouldn’t lose access to a river that he might be depending on for agriculture or commerce.
In the 1960s, the government began resurveying land along the Snake River, claiming that the original survey was erroneous and calling into question the ownership of about 7,000 acres of land along a 22-mile stretch of the river, from Grand Teton National Park to the South Park Bridge.
Before they built the levees, people didn’t really care too much.Rich Greenwood
The government claimed that the lands touching the meander line of the river actually belonged to the government, arguing that the original surveyors omitted riparian land because it was policy at the time to survey only land with agricultural value.
In 1966, the BLM sued Paul Walton, of the Walton Ranch, for quiet title to lands on the east bank of the Snake. In 1969, Judge Ewing Kerr ruled in favor of the BLM, which is why there is public land on the east bank of the river.
“All the BLM parcels were a result of litigation between the United States and private landowners,” Greenwood said.
In 1974, Snake River Ranch sued the government for quiet title to 55 acres of land that the owners feared the government would come after. Kerr ruled in the ranch’s favor, based on riparian law.
Despite the ruling, the government still believed it had a shot of taking ownership of thousands acres of riparian land along the Snake. U.S. Attorney Tosh Suyematsu said there were distinctive features of the Snake River Ranch case that would not come up in other cases. At the time of the Snake River Ranch decision, the government was in the process of suing more than 100 landowners for ownership of 3,236 acres along 22 miles of river.
Landowners claimed that they owned the land through riparian law, as their property ran to the center line of the river before the levees were built and controlled the meandering nature of the river, creating dry areas where land once flooded periodically.

Department of Justice attorneys claimed that the land existed in its present form when the original survey took place in 1893 and had been excluded from the survey, making it federal property. Attorneys for the government used trees, rocks and silt as evidence to try to prove that the lands existed before the survey.
In 1983, Judge Kerr determined that 400 acres of the land did belong to the government, and the rest belonged to landowners. The government spent nearly $1 million on the case and could have been on the hook for $400,000 in landowners’ legal fees if the verdict was appealed.
Teton County Deputy Attorney Keith Gingery said the government’s case had legs.
“The U.S. government would have probably won in the end,” he said. “If they had won, there would have been no big homes along the Snake River. There would have been no John Dodge. It would have been one big national park that would go down into the center of the valley.”
The case went up to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit a few times and was sent back to the district court each time, Gingery said. The appeals court kept saying that the land plausibly could be government property, but attorneys for the government needed to make a better case for its position.
“Depending on who you ask, it was a real miss from the judges who interpreted legal access,” said Orion Hatch, executive director of the Snake River Fund.
The case led to settlements with the landowners to allow for recreational easements that permit river users to get out of their boats, walk around on sand and gravel bars and anchor their boats. But the easements specifically prohibited levee-top access.
“Really what the federal government was after was making sure the public had access to the river,” Gingery said.
Levee wars
Property owners began gating off the levees soon after, emboldened by the ruling in favor of property rights.
In January 1984, State Sen. Tom Stroock, a Casper Republican and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, started a movement to cut state funding for levee maintenance until landowners removed “no trespassing” signs from the levees.
He said it was unconstitutional for the state to appropriate funds for private entities.
“If the dikes are private property, then there is a constitutional question,” he told the Jackson Hole News at the time. “If the dikes are public, it is appropriate for public money to be spent on them and I will support it. If they are public, they shouldn’t be posted and there shouldn’t be barbed wire fences.”
Teton County officials and state representatives were concerned that if the state withheld funding, the federal government would follow suit. Stroock relinquished his position after county leaders convinced him that without maintenance, floods could impact many landowners, not just those with riverfront properties.
Stroock owned a place in Teton Village and had encountered the signs himself while fishing, said John Turner, who represented Moose in the state Senate at the time.
“We went to battle over this,” Turner said. “Landowners had a right, as they do to any of their lands. Maintaining those dikes did not give access for skiing, biking and whatever. That did not grant us the right to traipse around on private property.”
Turner felt strongly about the funding issue because of the potential for damage across the entire floodplain.
Until the early 1990s, the levees were still open to cars. In 1991, landowners on the south side of the river began organizing to get the levees shut off to traffic, arguing that cars were turning the levees into a tent village and landfill.
At the time, the Jackson Hole News wrote an editorial in favor of keeping the levees open to traffic.
“In the course of the past decade public access to the levees along the Snake and Gros Ventre rivers has been systematically eliminated,” the editorial stated. “Although the dikes were built with public money to protect private lands from flooding, a series of court rulings awarded control of the levees to landowners who quickly slapped up gates and no trespassing signs.”
Gates beget gates
The rise of gates can be attributed to greater landowner confidence in their own property lines, an uptick in subdivided property and increased development generally.
Landowner Tom Kalishman declined to comment on his rationale for putting up a gate.
Landowners originally wanted gates on the levees to keep their cattle from wandering, Turner said. There aren’t many cows on the West Bank anymore, and the only large cattle operation left is Snake River Ranch, according to the Road and Levee Department. But the decrease in cattle actually has led to an increase in gates.
The number of gates on the levees has doubled in the past 20 years, according to Road and Levee estimates.
Landowners had a right, as they do to any of their lands. Maintaining those dikes did not give access for skiing, biking and whatever. That did not grant us the right to traipse around on private property.John turner
The Corps is trying to dissuade landowners from installing gates in the most-gated sections of river, such as the northwest levees. The county and the Corps have keys to all the gates, but the proliferation of obstacles could hinder their ability to respond to an emergency.
“I don’t want 1,000 gates on the levee because when I’m doing emergency repairs, my truck drivers have to get in and out,” Koebberling said. “At some point, it’s not that beneficial, anyway.”
Koebberling has been reluctant to impose an outright ban on gates, fearing that a “blanket rule” would provoke litigious landowners. But he has been trying to persuade landowners with security concerns that there are “different ways to skin a cat than putting up another gate.
“The county and I have had discussions that if the top of the levee is secured and the bottom of the levee is secured, why do we need all these gates in between?” Koebberling said. “There’s plenty in that John Dodge area, there’s more than enough.”
Some landowners do not even want government employees on their property to conduct maintenance. “There have been people who have made attempts at impeding us,” Koebberling said. “The county attorney gets involved and straightens it up pretty quick.”
Up by Solitude, property owners take care of their own maintenance, which some attribute to those property owners’ desire to steer clear of the government altogether. Some of the levees in that area also were built privately.
Gingery has encountered landowners who are upset when they see river users outside their properties.
“As more and more wealthy people buy into our valley, they think they bought the river,” Gingery said, citing an interaction with a property owner who was angry about seeing “a bunch of regular Jackson people hanging out and fishing” on the river near his home.
“He thought he had his own little private river,” Gingery said.
Paths forward
Besides Bradley’s one-man crusade against gates on the levees, there isn’t much of an appetite to try to overturn the 40-year-old legal precedent on the matter.
“It would be an amazing resource to be able to head north all the way up to Grand Teton National Park,” the Snake River Fund’s Hatch said. “Unfortunately, that’s not the reality.”
The status quo is rooted in litigation, not public policy, Commissioner Carlman said.
Granting public access to the levees either would require federal legislation, litigation or landowners coming together to provide recreational easements for levee-top access — all of which would take a lot of money, effort or both.
“My experience is that many of these landowners don’t have the appetite for increasing public access,” Hatch said. “When you have private landowners putting up gates, it’s not the best start.”

Nearly 42.5% of voters cast ballots, compared to about 37% in the last municipal election in 2023, when there was also a state Supreme Court position on the ballot.
The retention race for Supreme Court Justices Christine Donohue, Kevin Dougherty and David Wecht dominated the election cycle. Third-party spending aimed at unseating the three justices transformed the usually quiet municipal election into a media blitz to persuade voters either to boot or keep them.
Donohue, Dougherty and Wecht, who were first elected in 2015 as Democrats, won by the broad margins common in judicial retentions. Their results maintain the court’s 5-2 Democratic majority, although Donohue, 72, will be able to serve only three years before reaching the mandatory retirement age for state judges.
Chris Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion, said the high turnout was the result of a combination of attention heaped on the Supreme Court race and voters’ response to the turmoil that followed President Donald Trump’s return to office.
Many voters, Borick said, were “highly energized for their first opportunity to express their views” on Trump’s first nine months in office.

“You put those things together and it’s a recipe for the higher than average turnout we experienced in 2025,” he said, adding that while it’s likely some of that effect would carry over to the 2026 midterm elections, it would be unwise for Democrats to rely on a repeat next year.
Before the Department of State can certify statewide election results, counties must complete two audits of their results, Schmidt’s office said.
By law, each county must perform a recount of at least 2% of all ballots cast or 2,000 ballots, whichever is less.
The other audit is a statistically based risk-limiting audit, which involves randomly selected counties hand-tallying votes for a randomly chosen statewide race in randomly selected batches of ballots.
The department livestreamed the random contest selection process and the one  to randomly select which counties were selected to audit random batches of ballots. 
Superior Court Judge Alice Beck Dubow’s retention race was selected and auditors in nine counties manually reviewed 4,343 ballots to confirm the reported results were correct, the department said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7449-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 18:58:55.166539

The onslaught of messages came as a number of prominent right-wing social media accounts posted videos of the flag-raising on Monday.

The Winooski School District took down its website and disconnected many of its office phones Monday after receiving what its superintendent described as a flood of racist and violent messages in response to the district’s decision to raise a Somali flag.
Many of the messages appear to be part of a coordinated effort to target the district, where about 9% of students are Somali, spurred by prominent right-wing social media accounts, according to Wilmer Chavarria, the Winooski schools superintendent.
The district was forwarding messages it received on Monday to state law enforcement officials. A spokesperson for the Vermont State Police said investigators had been sent more than 200 such messages as of Monday afternoon and said their content so far appeared to be part of a “coordinated national campaign” against the district.
So far, none of the messages state investigators had reviewed seemed to present a credible threat of violence, Adam Silverman, the state police spokesperson, said in an email.
District leaders hosted a Somali flag-raising ceremony on Friday at the city’s combined elementary, middle and high school campus. The district later posted images and a video of the event, showing some of the students attending it, to its social media feeds.
The flag-raising was one of several actions the district has planned to show support for its Somali community in response to President Donald Trump’s tirade last week during a Cabinet meeting against Somali people living in Minnesota, according to Chavarria.
Trump called Somalis “garbage” that he said he did not want to have in the country and later ordered immigration agents into Minnesota. Officials from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security then touted the arrest of several Somali men, calling them the “worst of the worst.” The president has pointed to a sweeping fraud scandal in Minnesota that prosecutors allege largely involved Somali people as a justification for his actions.

“It’s almost marching orders for a large part of the U.S. population to go and harass our community,” Chavarria said, of the president’s comments, in an interview.
Starting Monday morning, the Winooski School District’s phone lines started “blowing up,” Chavarria said. He said some people were calling district employees the N-word, among other offensive names. Some calls included phrases such as “We’re coming for you. You don’t know what’s coming. You’re about to find out,” he said.
The messages coincided with posts on a number of popular right-wing social media pages that included the video of the flag-raising, contact information for the district and photos of its school board members, Chavarria said. He said he believed the posts were the reason for the sudden onslaught of calls, as well as a torrent of emails. 
The video being spread online shows only a Somali flag, which Chavarria said seems to have given the false impression that the school was flying it in place of a U.S. flag. He said that notion was reflected in the messages district employees received Monday.
In a post to its own social media feeds Monday, the district said it wanted “to assure our community” that the Somali flag was being flown on one of three flagpoles outside the city’s school, next to a U.S. flag and Vermont flag. The U.S. flag “remains in its proper place at the highest point,” the post stated. It also said the Somali flag would be flown for only one week.
As of Monday afternoon, posts were visible on the X accounts “End Wokeness” and “Libs of TikTok,” which together have more than 8 million followers, including the video of the flag-raising and text directing followers to call the school district’s central office.
Benny Johnson, a pro-Trump political commentator with 4 million X followers who is a former executive at Turning Point USA, the organization founded by the late Charlie Kirk, shared the flag-raising video Monday with the message, “I’ve got a suggestion for ICE’s next stop.”
(Federal immigration agents have already arrested immigrants living in Winooski, though the city, like the rest of the state, has not been the focus of one of Trump’s large-scale enforcement operations such as those in Los Angeles or New York.)

The right-wing X account “Libs of TikTok” posted a video Monday of the Somali flag being raised on the Winooski school campus and urged people to contact school leaders about it. Screenshot

“It’s pretty scary,” Chavarria said. But he said he and other district leaders think the reaction to the flag-raising shows the importance of the action in the first place.
“It’s given us even more of a mission to continue doing the right thing,” he said. “Because if they are willing to attack our employees to that extent, I don’t want to find out what they’re willing to do to our most vulnerable students in the building who just happen to be of a different color, speak a different language, have a different family story.”
Chavarria said the district had police patrolling its school Monday and that staff planned to take additional precautions such as keeping close tabs on students when they were outside.
On Monday afternoon, the Winooski schools’ website directed users to a page stating the site was offline while staff “address and mitigate an unprecedented volume of illegitimate traffic targeting our services.” 
The district was slated to host another gathering for its Somali community on Monday afternoon as part of its response to Trump’s comments last week, Chavarria said.

A Vermont Superior Court Judge dismissed a wrongful termination lawsuit filed by a former Brattleboro Union High School principal against his former school district.
Principal Steve Perrin was fired in November 2022 after the Windham Southeast School District accused him of mishandling an investigation into a sexual assault. A former student also accused him of harassing her and making inappropriate advances, according to court documents.
Perrin first appealed his termination to the school board following his firing. After school board members affirmed their decision to terminate him, he filed the lawsuit in March 2023.

Perrin vehemently denied the claims and alleged that the school board had wrongfully terminated him, defamed him and denied him his due process.
Superior Court Judge David Berra, in a Nov. 26 ruling, granted summary judgement to the defendants, including the Windham Southeast Supervisory Union, the Windham Southeast School District, and the 10 individuals serving as members of the board at the time of Perrin’s termination.
The decision was first reported by the Brattleboro Reformer.
Perrin could not be reached for comment. His attorney, Theodore Kramer, said in an email that “from time to time a case comes along that shakes your faith in fairness and our system of justice.”
“In the process of defending him, many educators confided in us that ‘there but for the grace of God go I,'” Kramer wrote. “That is to say, one accuser can end a career.”
Kramer added that Perrin was “undeterred, and determined to secure justice” and said he planned on appealing to the Vermont Supreme Court.
Perrin first started as principal of the Brattleboro school in 2011 but was fired in November 2022 after a decision of the school board. The board determined that it was “more likely than not” that Perrin had conducted an “inappropriate and harmful investigation” of a student’s sexual assault, according to court documents.
An independent investigator hired by the school district after the allegations surfaced found a “pattern of harassment, abuse, and unprofessional conduct” by Perrin, court documents read.
The former student, named Jane Doe in court documents, said that Perrin had interviewed her about a sexual assault off campus while she was a student at Brattleboro Union High School.
According to court documents, the former principal interviewed the student alone and behind closed doors in his office. He did not notify her parents of the interview despite her request to do so.
“Perrin persisted in questioning her despite her reluctance to answer and threatened her with an accusation of filing a false report,” court documents read.
Perrin then allegedly instructed a staff member not to file a report about the sexual assault with the Vermont Department for Children and Families that the staff member felt was required, according to court documents. (A report was eventually filed.)
Following the interview, Perrin had several more “uncomfortable interactions” with Doe — calling her into his office to interview her alone again, walking her between classes and making “uncomfortable and unwelcome remarks” about her appearance, according to court documents.
Perrin “touched Doe’s hair on one occasion” and “took a sexual interest in Doe,” according to court documents and transcripts.
Kramer, in an email, dismissed the allegations as “the most incredible and nonsensical of accusations.”
The school board, Kramer said in court documents, failed to “properly weigh the evidence,” and he said conflicting testimony was not considered. He further argued the student’s testimony lacked any corroborating evidence.
Judge Berra disagreed, writing in his decision that there was “sufficient evidence to make the findings the Board made.”
In weighing the school board’s decision to terminate Perrin, Berra wrote that it was not the role of the Superior Court to weigh the strength of testimony or corroboration, but to weigh whether the board’s decision was appropriate given the available evidence.
The “existence of conflicting testimony is not grounds for overturning the Board Decision,” he wrote.
Berra said he found nothing to support Perrin’s argument that his due process rights were violated. He similarly denied other allegations aired by Perrin, including defamation and intentional infliction of emotional distress.
“Perrin spends much time attacking Doe’s credibility, but not the sufficiency of the Board’s findings if her testimony is believed,” Berra wrote in his dismissal. “Witness after witness when questioned confirmed the simple truth that if Doe’s testimony were true the Board Decision was proper.”
“The question for the court to consider is whether there was sufficient basis in the testimony to support the findings and conclusions,” Berra wrote. “There is.”

It’s decorated with over 2,400 lights and roughly 1,700 ornaments handmade by children and seniors across the commonwealth.
Gov. Josh Shapiro, first lady Lori Shapiro and Lt. Gov. Austin Davis were on hand for the event.

Shapiro called it the tallest tree to adorn the rotunda in more than a decade.
“I want you to know it just fills my heart with joy,” Shapiro said. “It reminds me I’m part of a broader community, and I think it puts a smile on people’s faces.”
Shapiro is the first Jewish governor of Pennsylvania. He and his family have continued the tradition of decorating the Governor’s Residence for Christmas.
“While our family celebrates Hanukkah this time of year, it was really important to us to continue the tradition of transforming the governor’s residence into a home filled with Christmas cheer,” Lori Shapiro said. “Christmas brings joy and we love being a part of it.”
The Central Dauphin High School Choir sang, and Rev. Anjel Scarborough, rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Hershey, provided an invocation.
Scarborough began by noting the “challenges” 2025 has brought — uncertainty, polarization, and violence. That included the firebombing of the governor’s residence on the Jewish Passover holiday in April, which was not mentioned directly.
“In a season with these kinds of challenges, it’s important to lean into two things,” she said. “The power of hope and the necessity of courage.”
Lt. Gov. Austin Davis also spoke, imploring Pennsylvanians to be kind to those, regardless of their faith, who may be alone, struggling or grieving through the holidays.
“That’s the true spirit of Christmas,” he said. “I hope you all will join me in that spirit.”
Scarborough ended the ceremony with a reading of the Franciscan Benediction.

“May God bless you with discomfort at easy answers, half-truths and superficial relationships, so that you may live deep within your heart,” she said. “May God bless you with anger at injustice, oppression and exploitation of people, so that you may work for justice, freedom and peace.”
The tree will remain in the main rotunda through Jan. 7, and will be lit from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. daily.

(File photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)COLUMBIA — A South Carolina law meant to prevent election fraud makes it harder for people with disabilities to vote, civil rights groups claimed in a federal lawsuit.
Under a 2022 law, anyone can vote early with no excuse necessary or request an absentee ballot to vote by mail. To prevent the possibility of fraud, legislators added a limit of five ballots that any one person could request or submit for someone else.
In nursing homes and residential care settings, where residents often rely on a single staff member to help them vote, that makes voting difficult, attorneys for the state American Civil Liberties Union argued in a lawsuit filed in federal court Friday.
Three nursing home residents sued alongside the state NAACP, contending the law violates the federal Voting Rights Act.
Robert Caldwell, a 74-year-old resident of a Chester nursing home, has relied on a single social worker, Barvette Gaither, to help him vote in years past. According to the lawsuit, Gaither is a popular choice for assistance at the nursing home, since she has a good rapport with residents and knows a lot about the voting process.
Before the law, she submitted between 10 and 25 ballots for residents each election. Since the law passed, she has had to choose five residents and hand the rest off to other staff members or the residents’ family members, according to the lawsuit.
The same is true for 60-year-old Jonathan Bell and 75-year-old Sherry Jenkins, who live at a nursing home in Union. Deborah Allen, who oversees activities for Union Post Acute nursing home, helped most of its 25 residents submit ballots because she knew the process and deadlines, the lawsuit claims.
After the 2022 changes to state law, Allen had to prioritize who to help and Bell was not among them, since he has immediate family members nearby. But Bell worries he can’t rely on his family to help him fill out the ballot correctly and get it submitted on time, according to the lawsuit.
“These laws target some of our state’s most vulnerable voters and make it harder — sometimes even impossible —to cast a ballot,” Allen Chaney, legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina, said in a release. “Voters who need help voting deserve to receive that help from someone they trust, without worrying that the state might arrest the person they choose.”
Nursing homes could assign other staff members to help residents. But, according to the legal challenge, the Voting Rights Act guarantees voters help from the person of their choice, even if that person is the choice of more than five residents.
Voting rights advocates raised similar concerns when the law passed in 2022. Some members of the League of Women Voters have stepped in to help people who can no longer rely on nursing home staff to help them vote, said Lynn Teague, the state chapter’s vice president.
“People in nursing homes are very often dependent on staff for their assistance,” Teague said Monday.
The June 2022 primaries were the first election under the law, which was widely praised at its ceremonial signing by lawmakers and leaders of both parties.
Although voting rights activists knew that section of the law might cause problems, it took several years for the stories of people in nursing homes struggling to vote since its passage to reach people who could file a lawsuit on their behalf, Chaney said.
“The voters being harmed are pretty far from the limelight,” Chaney said.
The five-ballot limitation was a compromise.
The cap was meant to prevent people from collecting a massive number of ballots, which they could then tamper with or discard, skewing the results one way or another, said Rep. Brandon Newton, a Lancaster Republican who shepherded the bill through the House.
“That’s when you have the opportunity for shenanigans, when someone is handling someone else’s ballots,” Newton said.
State law already banned volunteers or employees for a candidate from collecting heaps of ballots, a practice often called ballot harvesting. Legislators still worried about the potential for fraud if a single person turned in a large number of ballots, Newton said.
Some lawmakers wanted to allow only immediate family members to return an absentee ballot. Others wanted no cap at all. They settled on five after considering likely family scenarios, Newton said.
People who care for their elderly parents, parents-in-law and a homebound spouse, for instance, might need to submit five ballots in addition to their own. Any more ballots than six total per election cycle gets fishy, Newton said.
“We did not want to inconvenience anyone, but there needs to be a reasonable limit,” Newton said.
Beyond capping the number of ballots an “authorized representative” can turn in, the law limits who can be assisted. Voters can be helped by people who aren’t immediate family members if they’re physically unable to go to a polling place. According to the law’s definition of “authorized representative,” assisted voters must be ill or have a physical disability that confines them to a long-term care facility, hospital or their own home.
According to the lawsuit, that can leave people with cognitive disabilities unable to vote. They might rely on people who aren’t immediate family members for day-to-day help, which could include completing the absentee ballot process, the lawsuit claims.
State law also requires anyone helping a voter be registered to vote in South Carolina as well, which can cause problems for people living in facilities bordering state lines, since staff members might travel from North Carolina or Georgia, according to the lawsuit.
The ACLU is asking a federal judge to instruct the state attorney general to immediately stop enforcing the law, then throw it out entirely, according to the filing.

DemasA last-ditch appeal to the Michigan Supreme Court was filed Monday in the state Senate’s lawsuit against the House of Representatives, which sought court intervention over nine bills that never reached the governor’s desk after they passed the Senate at the end of the 2024 session.
The Court of Appeals in October ordered the Court of Claims to enter a writ of mandamus for the upper chamber in Michigan Senate v. Michigan House of Representatives. The lower court previously ruled that the House had an obligation to present the bills to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, even though the 2024 session was over, never ordered the House to do so because Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel worried about separation of powers constraints.
House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) has long held that the 2024 Legislature had the obligation to present the bills, which was under the leadership of a different House speaker and political party control, and that the obligation did not extend to his 2025 legislature and speakership.
Court of Appeals: Withheld Michigan House bills must be presented to the governor

State Senate Majority Leader Winnie Brinks (D-Grand Rapids) called foul and sued Hall and the House over the lack of movement on the bills after they were passed by the Senate but not presented for Whitmer’s signature.
After losing in the Court of Appeals, the House is asking the state’s high court, which has a 6-1 majority of justices appointed or nominated by Democrats, to settle the dispute.
In the request for leave to appeal filed Monday, the House again argued that the issues revolve around the validity of legislative actions, and how those actions could be negatively impacted by what it labeled as a bad call from the Court of Appeals.
“The Court of Appeals erred … first erred in reaching the merits of the Senate’s claims against the House, given that the claims are not justiciable and the Senate lacks standing,” the House wrote in its filing. “It compounded that error when interpreting the constitutional text at issue to require the 103rd House to present bills passed by the 102nd Legislature. Last, it erred in the relief it ordered, by directing the Court of Claims to issue a writ of mandamus against the Legislature.”
The bills in question – House Bills 4177, 4665, 4666, 4667 [which passed in the lower chamber in 2023] and House Bills 4900, 4901, 5817, 5818 and 6058 [which were passed by the House in 2024] –  were passed by the Senate during a marathon lame duck session of the upper chamber at the tail end of 2024.
The House, then under Democratic control, was in a state of disarray when state Rep. Karen Whitsett (D-Detroit) joined a mutiny of sorts staged by Hall, who led a GOP walk out and locked up the lower chamber from passing any of the Senate’s bills in the final days of lame duck.
Michigan House adjourns after again failing to get a quorum, stranding legislative priorities

Undeterred, the Democratic-controlled Senate under Brinks pushed on and passed as many of the House bills as it could before the clock ran out on the 2024 term. That included the nine bills at the center of the current presentment battle.
When the Senate voted on the bills, it sent them back to the House to enroll them for presentation to the governor. The House under former Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and the House clerk did not complete that task before the end of the term and have never offered an explanation as to why.
That caused a legal controversy over whether the new House, under Hall’s leadership, had an inherent duty to present the bills – which passed both chambers – to Whitmer. Hall’s legal team said it did not have that duty, to which the Senate bristled.
Michigan Supreme Court orders lower court to decide stalled-bill deadlock

Patel ultimately ruled for both parties in a confusing decision. Patel’s ruling also landed on the separation of powers doctrine, noting the lower court did not have the authority to tell the legislative branch how to function.
Both sides claimed victory even though the ruling did not grant mandamus relief – or a specific order from the court compelling an elected official to fulfill their duties – and the bills were no closer to Whitmer’s desk and pen.
The House appealed to the Court of Appeals for greater clarity, to which the Senate filed a cross-appeal asking if the lower court had erred when it failed to grant mandamus relief.
In the opinion issued by the Court of Appeals, Judge Thomas Cameron wrote  that the House failed to show that the Senate lacked standing to bring the case. He also disagreed with the House in its assertion that the Senate’s legal challenge was unclear enough and unable to seek relief from the court.
Now it is up to the state’s high court to decide the matter and the fate of the bills at hand.
The court has not issued a decision on whether it would take up the matter. If it does, the court could decide the matter on the pleadings already filed with the court, or place the case on its upcoming oral arguments schedule to hear both sides in its own chambers. The court could decide not to hear the case at all, letting the Court of Appeals opinion stand if it takes no further action.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_9166-1024x699.jpg,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

The estate, represented by Torres-García’s father Victor Torres, seeks $100 million in damages — $75 million in Torres-García’s case and an additional $25 million in her sister’s case. The paperwork includes a long list of allegations of negligence on the part of DCF, including a failure to protect the girl from her mother, Karla García, and her mother’s ex-boyfriend, Jonatan Nanita, who have since been charged in her death.

According to paperwork filed on Thursday with Connecticut’s claims commissioner, the lawsuit will argue, in part, that DCF failed to perform adequate wellness checks on Torres-García. That allegation is made in light of information released by DCF that another child had impersonated Torres-García during a wellness check conducted via Zoom in early 2025. 
At the time, DCF said that its caseworker was notified that Torres-García was visiting a relative out of state, and because the primary abuse allegation being investigated regarded her sibling, the agency allowed the wellness check of Torres-García to be made via Zoom. DCF welfare checks on children are normally conducted in person, with few exceptions, according to the agency. Lawmakers and advocates have demanded answers as to why the wellness check occurred via Zoom, and how the agency could have been fooled.
In the document, the estate also accuses DCF of negligence in its training and supervision of employees, officers, agents and/or servants of DCF who were involved in the case, and also accuses DCF of prematurely closing the case involving Torres-García and her family.
Paperwork was also filed by Connecticut’s Department of Administrative Services on Thursday that indicates that the state is investigating whether the heirs of Torres-García could owe funds to reimburse “for aid, care or services provided by the State of Connecticut.”
According to Leigh Appleby, a spokesman for DAS, such a letter is routinely sent “when DAS is in the process of investigating whether the estate or any of the estate’s beneficiaries has a debt,” to any of the agencies, like DCF, that DAS is responsible for collecting.

American democracy is straining under countless pressures, many of them rooted in structural problems that go back to the nation’s founding. Chief among them is the “pick one” plurality voting system – also called winner-take-all – used to elect nearly all of the 520,000 government officials in the United States.
In this system, voters select one candidate, and the candidate who receives the highest number of votes wins.
Plurality voting is notorious for producing winners without majority support in races that have more than two candidates. It can also create spoilers, or losing candidates whose presence in a race alters the outcome, as Ralph Nader’s did in the 2000 presidential election. And it can result in vote-splitting, where similar candidates divide support, paving the way for a less popular winner. This happened in the 2016 Republican primaries when Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and John Kasich split the anti-Donald Trump vote.
Plurality can also encourage dishonest voting. That happens when voters are pressured to abandon their favorite candidate for one they like less but think can win. In the 2024 elections, for example, voters whose preference for president was Jill Stein, the Green Party nominee, might have instead cast their vote for Democrat Kamala Harris.
An increasingly well-known alternative to plurality voting is ranked choice voting. It’s used statewide in Maine and Alaska and in dozens of municipalities, including New York City.
 Better performance

Whereas plurality voting allows voters to select only one candidate, ranked choice lets them rank candidates. If a candidate secures a majority of first-place rankings, they are the winner just like they would be under plurality.
But the two systems diverge when there is no majority winner. Plurality simply chooses the candidates with the most first-place votes, while ranked choice voting eliminates the person with the fewest first-place votes and transfers their votes to the next candidate on each ballot. The process is repeated until there is a majority winner.
Ranked choice voting makes use of more information from the voters than plurality, but does it avoid some of the problems plurality suffers from?
We are a team of mathematicians who recently concluded a study aimed at answering this and related questions. We analyzed some 2,000 ranked choice elections from the U.S., Australia and Scotland. We supplemented those real-world results with 60 million simulated elections.
The results were clear: Ranked choice voting performed much better across all the measures we tested, including spoiler, vote-splitting, strength of candidates and strategic voting.

 Empowering voters

Plurality voting produced a spoiler up to 15 times more often than ranked choice voting. And it was 50% more likely to elect an extreme candidate. Plurality, furthermore, was highly susceptible to vote-splitting, while ranked choice voting was nearly impervious to it.
Ranked choice voting picked strong candidates up to 18 times more frequently than plurality voting, where by “strong” we mean candidates who received many first-place votes and also had broad support, even among their noncore supporters. This method also rarely elects a weak or fringe candidate and typically elects a candidate near the electorate’s ideological center.
Ranked choice voting is also more resistant to various forms of strategic behavior such as bullet voting, where voters choose only one candidate despite the ability to rank more, and burying, where voters disingenuously rank an alternative candidate lower in the hopes of defeating them.
Our research also studied the ways in which election systems can influence behavior. In a plurality election, voters are afraid that their ballot could be “wasted” on a candidate who doesn’t have a shot at winning, or that they might contribute to a spoiler. Our study shows that ranked choice voting largely avoids these pitfalls, empowering voters to express their true preferences rather than being strategic.
We found that candidates in ranked choice voting elections do best when they adopt the policies the greatest number of people support, meeting the voters where they are.
In Alaska’s 2022 special U.S. House election, for example, Democrat Mary Peltola positioned herself firmly within Alaska’s center-left base – while still embracing some positions considered conservative outside of Alaska. She won by garnering enough second-place votes from supporters of Republican Nick Begich.
And in the New York mayoral primary in June 2025, Zohran Mamdani won by creating a coalition with another progressive candidate, Brad Lander, and occupying a progressive space representing a range of voters.
The Alaska and New York examples highlight some differences with plurality voting, which often favors appealing to a narrow base without the necessity of reaching out beyond it.
 Mending a broken system

A mathematically interesting feature of Alaska’s 2022 special U.S. House election is that Begich beat both Peltola and Republican Sarah Palin in head-to-head contests – meaning that more people ranked Begich above Peltola than the other way around – but lost the ranked choice voting election to Peltola.
Critics seize on such cases as reasons to avoid ranked choice voting. But our work shows that these are statistical outliers, occurring fewer than 1% of the time.
Overall, our research shows that ranked choice voting elects candidates with broader support and greater democratic legitimacy than plurality. It therefore seems sensible that voting reform advocates continue to pursue this method as an alternative to plurality voting.
At a time when Americans are losing faith in democracy, voters cannot afford systems that hand victory to unrepresentative candidates and force them to play tactical games. The math is in, and the evidence is overwhelming: Plurality voting is broken. Ranked choice voting will not solve every democratic ailment, but it is a good step toward mending them.

Hypoxia refers to low oxygen levels in waters near the sea floor, making affected areas uninhabitable for fish and other marine life. It can happen when there is excessive nitrogen in the water, which comes from stormwater runoff and wastewater.
A study from the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection found hypoxia covered only about 18 square miles of the Sound at the maximum. That number is down from 43 in 2024 and 127 in 2023.
“This year’s historic decrease in hypoxia illustrates 40 years of amazing progress through the Long Island Sound Partnership,” said EPA Region 2 Administrator Michael Martucci in a statement. “Dedicated efforts and investments by EPA, Connecticut, New York, and local governments have drastically reduced the amount of nitrogen pollution entering the Sound, resulting in smaller affected areas and fewer days of low oxygen.”
The Long Island Sound Partnership, which includes DEEP and the EPA, has also released a Hypoxia Forecasting Model and Toolkit to help folks better understand what’s happening below the surface.
They say the best ways for residents to help include reducing fertilizers, picking up after their pets, and clearing debris near storm drains.

(Sharon Sullivan for Colorado Newsline)An attorney for Tina Peters, the former Mesa County clerk who is serving a Colorado prison sentence, addressed President Donald Trump directly in a letter to make the case that he should grant Peters a pardon.
The Florida-based attorney, Peter Ticktin, had already said he applied to the Trump administration last month for a pardon, as first reported by Newsline. In a new 9-page letter to Trump, Ticktin details his argument that Trump should pardon Peters, whom he casts as a political prisoner, and his contention that Trump has the power to pardon her.
Presidential pardons are understood across the legal profession to apply only to federal cases. Peters was convicted on state charges. But Ticktin claims in the letter that the scope of a president’s pardon power as described in the Constitution has been broadly misunderstood. He argues that the Constitution’s references to the United States apply to the individual states as well as the country as a whole, concluding, “The President of the United States has the power to grant a pardon in any of the states of the United States.”

Ticktin acknowledges in the letter that “the question of whether a president can pardon for state offenses has never been raised in any court,” but he thinks the U.S. Supreme Court should consider the matter.
Asked about the pardon request and the letter to Trump, a White House official wrote in an email, “The White House does not comment on potential clemency requests. The President is the final decider on all pardons.”

Newsline has made several attempts to verify with the U.S. Department of Justice receipt of Peters’ clemency petition but has not received a response.
Ticktin said the pardon request was filed a little less than three weeks ago. The letter to Trump is dated Dec. 7, and a spokesperson for Ticktin said it has been sent to Trump and Ed Martin, the U.S. pardon attorney.
Trump has repeatedly demanded that Colorado release Peters, and Martin has indicated the administration is working on freeing her. Trump’s Department of Justice has taken an active role in the case.
Phil Weiser, the Democratic Colorado attorney general, said in a statement to Newsline last week that a presidential pardon for someone convicted in state court “has no precedent in American law, would be an outrageous departure from what our constitution requires, and will not hold up.”
Peters, 70, is incarcerated at La Vista Correctional Facility in Pueblo. The Republican was convicted by a Mesa County jury and sentenced in October 2024. She was convicted for her role in a scheme to breach the security of her own election equipment in 2021, part of an effort to find evidence that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. 
There is no credible evidence that the 2020 election results were compromised or that Peters’ prosecution, which was led by a Republican district attorney, was flawed.
Much of Ticktin’s letter to Trump repeats the kind of stolen-election claims that for years have circulated among Trump supporters since the president himself initiated the lie that the 2020 election was stolen.

Getty ImagesA federal judge has struck down Georgia’s ban on gender-affirming care for transgender inmates in state custody, but the state is appealing the decision.
Judge Victoria M. Calvert’s decision, which was issued last week, means that the approximately 340 people with gender dysphoria diagnoses in the custody of the Georgia Department of Corrections can receive treatments like hormone therapy if their doctors deem it necessary. The case was brought by five transgender people in state custody.
Senate Bill 185, which was passed during the 2025 legislative session received Gov. Brian Kemp’s signature and went into effect in May after sparking controversy in both chambers during this year’s legislative session.
In the Senate, three Democrats crossed party lines to support the measure along with all Republicans, while four other Democratic senators did not vote.
Nearly all House Democrats took part in a walkout over the bill, characterizing it as a waste of time and part of what they called a fixation on a vulnerable minority. Three Democrats voted for the bill, while two others stayed in the chamber and voted against it.
Calvert’s ruling makes a temporary block on the bill she signed in September permanent.
The law called on doctors to monitor patients already receiving the treatments and taper the drugs gradually, and to provide counseling. Based on testimony, Calvert said that was “an inadequate blanket substitute for hormone therapy.” She said there is “no genuine dispute” that gender dysphoria is a serious medical need and that removing the option for doctors to treat it with hormone therapy without a medical reason violates the law.
“The Court does not hold that the Constitution requires all inmates receive hormone therapy if they want it,” she wrote. “Rather, the Court requires healthcare decisions for prisoners to be made dispassionately, by physicians, based on individual determinations of medical need, and for reasons beyond the fact that the prisoners are prisoners.”
Attorney General Chris Carr’s office appealed the ruling Monday. Carr said in a statement that his office is willing to fight the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Carr, a Republican, is running to be Georgia’s next governor.
The bill’s author, Cataula Republican Sen. Randy Robertson, said he’s not discouraged by the ruling.
“We planned this all along. We knew exactly how this was going to go, they were going to find a friendly judge, and Judge Calvert very much is that,” Robertson said of the Biden-nominated judge. ”
Robertson argued that Georgia taxpayers should not be on the hook for treatments he called not medically necessary, and he expressed confidence that his bill will be vindicated as it winds through the courts.
“I stand with Attorney General Carr in the belief that, at the end of the day, this will be in front of the U.S. Supreme Court, and it will quickly be upheld, the law will be established as constitutional and right, and we will be moving on to things that are more important in Georgia,” he added.
In June, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors, though that case deals with different aspects of the law than medical treatment for incarcerated people.
For now, transgender rights advocates are celebrating the ruling as a win.
Human Rights Campaign’s Georgia Director Bentley Hudgins said HRC and other groups mobilized thousands to oppose the bill as unconstitutional and a waste of money.
“It will bring more financial burdens to the State of Georgia and take valuable time away from solving actual issues,” Hudgins said. “Over $4.1 million has already been paid to settle cases like these. The House Democrats walked out on this bill because they saw it for what it was – undignified, expensive discrimination. It is my hope that when we return to the Gold Dome in January that our colleagues of all parties focus on bringing solutions to keep the hungry fed, expand access to health care and address the ever-rising cost of living.”
On the first day of his second term in office, President Donald Trump issued an executive order targeting federal recognition of transgender rights across various fields, including within prisons. The order prevents transgender women from being housed in women’s detention facilities and stops federal funds from being used for gender-affirming treatments.
Those rulings are being challenged in multiple court cases.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1245003810-scaled-1-1024x698.jpg,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

Chellie Pingree on Dec. 8, 2025. (Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine left a months-awaited tour of the U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement facility in Maine on Monday still without an answer as to why some attorneys have not been permitted to accompany their clients to routine check-ins at the facility.
ICE officials handed off these visits to an independent contractor called BI Incorporated, whose representatives were not present for the tour, though Pingree said she had requested the contractor be there. BI Incorporated supplies government agencies, including ICE, with electronic monitoring technology, such as GPS ankle monitors and the SmartLINK app to keep tabs on people via their phones.
“While we took all the time we possibly could to tour the facility, see the detention facilities, and ask every question we could, all of our questions have not been answered,” Pingree told press outside the facility in Scarborough, “and we will continue to pursue them.”
BI Incorporated did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
In late September, the 1st District Democrat sent a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem requesting a tour of the field office — an administrative office building with three, short-term holding cells — following reports of attorneys being blocked from accompanying clients to routine ICE appointments there. Pingree is planning to send a follow up letter detailing her concerns after the visit on Monday. 
While the contractor was not in attendance, Pingree said she saw the office where the check-ins are held and was told by the ICE officials giving the tour that there were space limitations to bringing an attorney. “That’s just bullshit,” Pingree said. “There’s plenty of room in there.”
Melissa Brennan, co-legal director of the Immigrant Legal Advocacy Project, Maine’s only state-wide immigration legal services organization, was one of the attorneys who was denied access. 
“As has become the norm, there was a complete lack of transparency from ICE as to what the appointment was about and what my client and I could expect,” Brennan said of the appointment that occurred in early summer. “I had filed paperwork in advance identifying myself as his attorney, but when we arrived here at the ICE office, I was denied access to come inside with him.”
Brennan said her client was questioned despite her absence and ended up signing documents that enrolled him in an alternative to detention program in which he would have his whereabouts monitored. 
“He didn’t even understand what he was signing,” Brennan said. “I think what’s really most important is that people are deprived of that opportunity to consult with someone, to feel the assurance of having your legal counsel next to you just as much as it is about ultimate legal consequences.”
Brennan said she hopes Pingree’s oversight and the efforts of other elected officials across the country will help put an end to this type of unchecked power. Pingree said there are three documented cases of legal counsel being denied access to ICE check-ins at the Scarborough facility but noted the possibility of others. 
“People may not always report that they don’t get to bring in their attorney because they’re confused or baffled, or they’re moved to detention,” Pingree said. “One of the biggest challenges is that people are often moved to detention in another state and we aren’t able to track them down.” 
In response to a request for comment on the reports about attorneys being denied access, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin accused Pingree of “lying for likes and fundraising dollars.”
McLaughlin wrote in an emailed statement that allegations of attorneys being blocked from immigration appointments are false. “These types of smears are contributing to our officers facing a 1,000% increase in assaults against them,” McLaughlin wrote, repeating a figure often asserted by the Trump administration that is not backed up by court records.  
The number of assaults on ICE agents have increased, but there is no public evidence that the spike is as dramatic as the federal government has claimed.
Pingree also asked Noem in the letter whether a policy exists prohibiting legal counsel from attending routine ICE appointments, and if it does, its legal justification. DHS sent back what Pingree described as a “terse” response, comparable in content to the one the agency sent Maine Morning Star accusing Pingree of lying for political gain. 
When asked to comment on this part of the letter, McLaughlin said, “DHS responds to official correspondence through official channels.”

Dan McKee continues to attack his Democratic primary rival Helena Buonanno Foulkes over her professional and personal ties to pharmaceutical companies that contributed to the opioid crisis. (Left photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current; right photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Rhode Island Gov. Dan McKee continues to attack 2026 Democratic rival Helena Buonanno Foulkes for her personal and professional ties to the pharmaceutical industry.
The latest jab from the McKee campaign came in the midst of a Monday luncheon fundraiser for Foulkes, hosted by her uncle, former U.S. Sen. Chris Dodd.
The private luncheon for Foulkes was held at The University Club on the East Side of Providence, with tickets for attendees ranging from $500 to $2,000 — the maximum annual contribution to political candidates under state law. Dodd was listed on the event flyer as a special guest, alongside dozens of other prominent names in state politics and business circles who are backing Foulkes in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary. 
A fixture in Democratic politics, Dodd represented his home state of Connecticut for two decades in the U.S. Senate, until 2011, and is the partial namesake of the famous Wall Street reform law, the “Dodd-Frank Act.” 
But McKee’s campaign offers a different descriptor of Dodd: “Purdue Pharma ally.”
And the governor’s campaign says Dodd’s involvement in a fundraiser for Foulkes is further proof of her ties to the “very insiders who enabled Purdue’s rise.”
“Helena Foulkes and Chris Dodd both had a choice when it came to Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers — and they both chose profits over saving lives,” Christina Freundlich, McKee’s campaign spokesperson, said in a statement Monday. “This once again speaks to the troubling record of Helena Foulkes and her ties to the elite who defend the system that enabled heinous crimes. We deserve a governor who will stand up to corporate greed, protect lives and put the people of Rhode Island first.”
The opioid epidemic, and Foulkes’ potential involvement as a former CVS executive, was a central topic in the 2022 gubernatorial primary, which featured Foulkes, McKee and three other Democratic candidates. McKee bested Foulkes in the primary by a 3-percentage-point margin. 
But in the 2026 rematch, Foulkes appears to hold a slight advantage over McKee among prospective Democratic voters, according to preliminary polls. Foulkes also leads McKee in campaign fundraising as of Oct. 31, the most recent campaign finance reporting deadline. 
Jon Romano, a spokesperson for Foulkes’ campaign, pointed to McKee’s unfavorable polling numbers in a response to the criticism over the fundraiser.
“Dan McKee is polling at 11% because he has been a weak, incompetent governor who has no argument for why he deserves an unprecedented third term,” Romano said in an emailed response Monday. “So instead he attacks Helena’s uncle for hosting a fundraising event for her. McKee is once again disparaging CVS, Rhode Island’s largest employer, while deliberately ignoring the truth that under Helena’s leadership, CVS reduced opioid sales by nearly 40% and was a national leader in tackling the opioid epidemic.”
Recent voter surveys also reiterate McKee’s waning popularity and continued public dissatisfaction over his handling of the Washington Bridge project. 
Foulkes has made McKee’s perceived missteps over the infrastructure project a key point of her challenge against him.
Yet McKee’s campaign remains stuck on Foulkes’ ties to CVS, fueled by a federal lawsuit unsealed in late 2024 which alleges the pharmacy company worsened the opioid crisis by filling fake prescriptions for opioids and other controlled substances. The 97-page complaint never mentioned Foulkes by name. Hours before Foulkes’ 2026 campaign announcement in September, McKee’s campaign released a digital ad on YouTube, with a corresponding website, again centered on the Department of Justice lawsuit and Foulkes’ role in the opioid crisis. 
The 97-page federal lawsuit never mentions Foulkes by name. 
McKee’s latest attack against Foulkes and Dodd relies primarily on reporting by GoLocalProv, which claims to have been investigating the opioid crisis since 2017. The headlines are damning. A story from Jan. 21, 2025, declares “INVESTIGATION: Foulkes Made Tens of Millions at CVS While She Rode Profits From Opioid Epidemic. However, the public documents cited in the article do not directly link Foulkes to the legal allegations against Purdue Pharma or CVS over the opioid epidemic. Another GoLocal story about Dodd highlights a comment he made in defense of Purdue during a 2002 U.S. Senate hearing. 
McKee’s campaign also links to a 2009 New York Times article entitled “Dodd’s Uneasy Dance with Drug Lobbyists,” which scrutinizes his close relationship with pharmaceutical industry groups, including Purdue Pharma. Dodd received hundreds of thousands of dollars in advertisements for his political campaigns during his time in office, alongside attending swanky lobbyist-sponsored fundraising events. But, in the article, his campaign manager and aides said these relationships did not sway Dodd’s position on health care legislation. 
Gregory Stevens, who owns a trio of local Italian restaurants, has also filed paperwork to run in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary.
House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi is widely speculated as a fourth potential Democratic candidate for governor, although he has not confirmed it. Three Republicans —  Aaron Guckian, an aide to former Gov. Don Carcieri; retired comedian Elaine Pelino and local businessman Robert Raimondo — have also entered the 2026 gubernatorial race.

Andy Beshear to issue a moratorium on utility disconnections. (Provided)A coalition of advocacy groups is urging Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear to halt utility disconnections in Kentucky until March.
The groups, led by the advocacy campaign Kentuckians for Energy Democracy, gathered Monday morning in front of the state Capitol in Frankfort urging Beshear to issue a moratorium amid an uncertain future for federal funding for housing, heating and food assistance.
The groups made a similar call to action during the record-long federal government shutdown earlier this year. 
A release from the coalition — which includes the Metropolitan Housing Coalition, the Kentucky Conservation Committee, Sierra Club Kentucky, VOCAL-KY, Kentuckians for the Commonwealth and others — states “a reprieve from the recent government shutdown doesn’t change the dire situation that many people are facing this winter amidst rising electricity and other costs.”
“And no one should have to choose between groceries, buying medicine, or keeping the heat on. Yet, Kentucky continues to have no statewide utility disconnection policy for extreme weather conditions,” the coalition wrote in a media release. 
Some of the advocacy groups during past legislative sessions in Frankfort have been supporting state legislation that would prevent disconnections during extreme weather. During this year’s legislative session, a Democratic-sponsored bill to limit when utilities could disconnect a customer, including on what the temperature is outside, did not advance in the GOP-controlled legislature. 
Cara Cooper, the coordinator for Kentuckians for Energy Democracy, previously told the Lantern that Beshear has the power to issue a moratorium through executive order similar to an order he issued in the beginning months of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Cooper in a Lantern interview after the rally said the groups plan to advocate for utility disconnection protections heading into next year’s legislative session. 
“Every week that we stall on this, more people are at risk,” Cooper said, mentioning the cold weather Kentucky is experiencing this week. “We will continue to work on this issue because it remains really important.”
The amount of federal funding approved by the GOP-controlled Congress for various social safety net programs still remains to be seen, though the Trump administration has proposed eliminating a federal program that provides billions of dollars nationwide to help low-income people afford heating and cooling costs. Kentuckians received tens of millions of dollars in funding through the Low-income Home Energy Assistance Program, or LIHEAP in the last fiscal year.",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/8657713191777181706-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

With costs increasing and revenues failing to meet projections, the state health plan’s reserve account will fall below its target in January 2028, consultants told health plan trustees last week. 
A looming deficit pushed the State Health Plan trustees to increase beneficiaries’ insurance premiums, out-of-pocket costs, and copays for 2026. The premium increase was the first in years. For the first time, premiums will be pegged to employee salaries. 
The health plan is still on firmer financial footing than it has been in the past, state officials told reporters last week. The plan won’t be running a deficit in 2026 or 2027 as was once projected, said Tom Friedman, State Health Plan executive administrator.
But more changes are coming to the insurance plan that covers about 750,000 state employees, teachers, retirees, and dependents. 
The health plan trustees are scheduled to vote on benefits changes in March and on premium increases for 2027 in July. 
The North Carolina Association of Educators opposed the 2026 premium hikes. Another increase for 2027 would amount to a pay cut for educators, President Tamika Walker Kelly said in a statement.
“Their wages have been stagnant for years—already lagging behind neighboring states and well below the national average,”her statement said.  “Now, on top of inflation and a rising cost of living, they’re being asked to shoulder yet another financial burden. Educators do exceptional work in our schools, and they deserve to see the value of that work reflected in both their pay and their benefits.”
After trustees heard a presentation on health plan finances Dec. 5, Friedman said the health plan needs to move more aggressively to lower costs for the plan and for beneficiaries.
“This is a cost problem,” he said. “We have to drive those costs down so we can continue to invest in health.”
Part of attacking that problem will involve creating more financial incentives for beneficiaries to use lower-cost providers, he said.
“There are a lot of areas where there are significant variants in cost that are not driven by quality,” he said. “We have to make it affordable and simple for members to go to lower-cost, high quality providers.”
Using medical imaging — MRIs and other diagnostic scans — as an example, the health plan could save money if more enrollees used free-standing radiology centers rather than getting those scans in hospitals, he said. The plan would have to offer financial incentives to beneficiaries to draw them to the free-standing offices, and would have to negotiate lower costs with the providers in exchange for higher patient volume. 
“We don’t need a lot of movement to save tens of millions of dollars in this area,” he said. 
That strategy could work in the Triangle, where free-standing medical imaging offices are clustered. But those independent offices aren’t available in and around Mecklenburg County, so health plan administrators will need to use a different strategy there.
 Some rural counties have no imaging options nearby. The health plan may need to contract with mobile imaging services to cover rural areas. 
The health plan started to build a “preferred provider” network this year, where hundreds of providers have agreed to bundled payments to cover costs of procedures, rather than billing separately for each step in medical treatment. Primary care is the best developed arm of the network, with providers statewide participating, according to a Health Plan map. 
An important step in broadening the network will be adding more OB-GYNs and making “better maternity bundles to make it more affordable to have a baby in North Carolina,” Friedman said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/IMG_4691-1-1024x591.jpg,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

(Jacob Reeder/LSU Sports Information)  A Louisiana Legislature task force on name, image and likeness deals for student-athletes is suggesting the state create new laws to regulate agents and sponsorships for high school athletes. 
Its members met Monday and recommended expanding the definition of an agent to include people involved in securing NIL deals for athletes. The group also recommended the Louisiana attorney general require background checks and mandatory training on NIL activities for registered agents. 
Name, image and likeness deals for high school athletes are currently not addressed in state law. The task force has suggested legislation to require parental consent for minors to sign sponsorships and prohibit deals with certain industries, such as adult entertainment and alcoholic beverages. The task force also recommended regulating the NIL-related work students can do during school hours and during school-related events. 
The task force also wants to pursue legislation that would require underaged athletes deposit a portion of their compensation into a protected trust account, similar to a current state law for child actors.

State Rep. Tehmi Chassion, D-Lafayette, who sits on the task force, said the legislation would likely be carried either by him or Rep. Rashid Young, D-Homer, a former Grambling State football player who chairs the task force and authored the resolution that created it. 
Chassion said any legislation would need the blessing of Gov. Jeff Landry and Republican legislators. 
The task force also recommended the creation of a separate study group to analyze the funding structures of athletics departments at Louisiana’s public colleges and universities. Although LSU earns enough money from its football program to finance the rest of its sports teams, athletics departments at every other state university operate at a loss. Their programs require financial support from the universities and, at times, contribute to severe financial problems at the schools. 
Lawmakers approved a bill this year that increases the state tax on sports gambling to give some of the money to state college athletics programs. Each school will receive approximately $2 million annually from the program starting next year. 
In addition to its legislative goals, the task force recommended universities educate student-athletes about mental health and create policies prohibiting international athletes from engaging in NIL deals until there is federal guidance on the topic. 
International student-athletes, who must obtain visas to attend school in the United States, have prohibitions against outside employment or participating in any income-generating activities. Those who receive sponsorship deals risk losing their legal status to be in the country. 
The task force also recommended that universities consider the Title IX implications when creating NIL policies and revenue sharing. This summer, a federal judge approved a settlement in the case House v. NCAA that will allow schools to pay their student-athletes directly. Many colleges that do not make a profit with their athletics program will still pay their players to maintain a competitive advantage. 
Title IX requires equity in educational access, including offering athletic scholarships proportionate to the gender balance in enrollment. It does not require equal spending on men’s and women’s programs. 
In Louisiana, LSU, Grambling, Northwestern, Southeastern and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette are participating in revenue sharing. 
The task force recommended schools update their NIL policies by August 2026. Any new legislation would likely be filed in the upcoming regular legislative session that begins March 9 and concludes June 1. Any legislation passed would likely be implemented the following August or January.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/LSU-CWS--1024x683.webp,,,2025-12-08 17:57:08.017363

Local communities around the country are seeking more input on where and how data centers are built. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)Members of the public have until noon on Wednesday, Dec. 10 to submit public comments that could help shape how data centers and their connected microgrids operate in the state of West Virginia.
The public comment period on proposed rules for House Bill 2014 comes as the construction of several microgrid-powered data center complexes move forward in the state. Several of these proposals — including those in Mason, Mingo and Tucker counties — have sparked local pushback and community concerns over how the complexes could impact public health, air quality, water resources, tourism economies and more.
The influx in data center-related projects in West Virginia follows the passage of HB 2014 during the 2025 regular legislative session. That bill created a specialized tax structure to incentivize data center companies to locate in West Virginia and build their own power sources, most often through natural gas power plants. 
The legislation means that counties where a data center is located will only receive 30% of the property tax revenue from the facilities despite bearing the brunt of all environmental or economic impacts the data centers and power plants could bring. Another 50% of the property tax revenue will go to the state’s Personal Income Tax Reduction Fund, while 10% will be disbursed to the 54 other counties split on a per capita basis using the most recent U.S. Census, 5% will be placed in the Economic Enhancement Grant Fund administered by the Water Development Authority and the final 5% will be put in the newly created Electric Grid Stabilization and Security Fund.
In addition to diverting the property tax revenues, HB 2014 also allows companies to curtail local zoning ordinances, meaning local governments have no control or say in how the facilities operate within their communities. That provision has caused upset at the local level, and last month state Senate President Randy Smith told some of his constituents in Tucker County that the lack of local control is something his members “want to address” with legislation this upcoming session.
Smith voted in support of HB 2014. He said last month that while he had concerns over the legislation, it would have been “hard on [his] political career to kill a governor’s bill.”
Since HB 2014’s passage this April, environmental advocates from around the state have been organizing to understand more about proposed projects and push the state Department of Environmental Protection to practice transparency when companies apply for permits.
In the public comment period, advocates are urging the public to request that the state implement a public and transparent process for microgrids and data centers who apply for permitting to build and locate here. They want to see applicants publicly provide more detailed information regarding environmental and community impacts from the facilities, which is information that has often been redacted in air quality permit applications due to alleged trade secrets. These impact reports, they say, should be independently conducted and verified.
Advocates say the companies that apply to build and operate certified microgrids and data centers should also be required to negotiate directly with local governments over community benefit agreements. While broad, that could mean seeing the applicants support public services — including schools, police and emergency medical services — that they will also rely on if moving into the communities.
While the public comment period ends Wednesday, advocates are asking the state Division of Economic Development to hold an in-person, public hearing before the rules are finalized. 
Comments on the proposed rules can be emailed to the general counsel for the state Department of Commerce at Garner.Marks@WV.gov before noon on Wednesday. They can also be mailed to A. Garner Marks, 1900 Kanawha Blvd., Building 3, Suite 800, Charleston, WV 25305.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-08 21:56:51+00:00,CT Mirror,Lamont frames controversial housing bill as key to an affordable CT,Mark Pazniokas,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/lamont-housing-bill-8002/,The ceremonial signing of HB8002 was a part of a campaign narrative casting the governor’s June veto of a housing bill as key to its revision.,"At a ceremonial signing of an omnibus housing bill opposed by every Republican in the General Assembly and the two GOP candidates for governor, Gov. Ned Lamont embraced the measure Monday as a step toward addressing a housing crisis central to the high cost of living in Connecticut.
“Well, you’re not serious about affordability unless you’re serious about housing, and housing starts with a diversity of housing where all of our folks can afford to step up, step down, but have a place they can call home,” said Lamont, a Democrat seeking a third term in 2026.
Lamont spoke at Oak Grove, a new 69-unit apartment complex in Norwalk open to renters earning between $45,000 and $179,120 annually. With a community center that provides free after-school care to K-5 children, the complex caters to working parents in one of the most expensive corners of a high-cost state.
The ceremony was an element of a campaign narrative casting the governor’s surprising veto in June of an earlier version of the bill as key to the subsequent revisions drafted in consultation with Republican and Democratic municipal officials, several of whom stood with Lamont to praise the outcome.
After the opposing the original version, the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities and Council of Small Towns endorsed House Bill 8002, the version passed in a special session last month. Key provisions require municipalities to set goals for housing growth and provide incentives to meet them.
To lower costs and streamline permitting, the law eliminates minimum off-street parking requirements for new developments with up to 16 housing units and sets parameters allowing conversion of commercial properties to residential without special hearings before planning and zoning commissions.
State Sen. Ryan Fazio of Greenwich and former Mayor Erin Stewart of New Britain, who are competing for the GOP gubernatorial nomination, joined Republican lawmakers in branding the law as undermining local zoning control of the state’s 169 cities and towns.
“Look, it’s a political football for the candidates, no question about it,” Lamont said. “For me, it was important to get the mayors and first selectmen on board on a bipartisan basis. We got that done. And I think at the end of the day, you make the case to the people: this is really important for their kids, important for our economic future.”
Michael J. Freda, a Republican in his ninth term as first selectman of North Haven, said municipal officials of both parties accepted the governor’s invitation to negotiate a compromise that constructively encourages housing development without undermining local control.
“I’m starting to hear, even in my area, that the bill is a bad bill. ‘We’re going to lose local control.’ I can tell each and every one of you here, we’re not going to lose local control. I can guarantee you that,” Freda said. “And if anybody has any questions, you can call me at North Haven Town Hall.”
Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, a prominent force behind passage, as was House Majority Leader Jason Rojas, D-East Hartford, said Republicans wrongly assume that the bill is a liability for Democrats.
“I think the Republicans are on the wrong side of this issue, because you see all across the nation where Republican legislatures are leading on housing, and they have done things that are far more radical than anything we would ever consider even doing,” Duff said.
More than a dozen states have enacted housing laws since 2022. 
Common provisions include mandates that limit local review by setting standards for what can be built as-right, a push to allow duplexes, triplexes and other modest multi-family housing in single-family zones, incentives for higher-density projects near transit lines, and rules easing the the redevelopment of underused commercial properties as housing.
“This is a political loser for anybody who voted against the bill,” Duff said “Housing is important for seniors. It’s important for our middle-class families, important for our recent college graduates.”
Some of the Democratic lawmakers attending the ceremony were from wealthy suburban districts, including Sen. Ceci Maher of Wilton and Reps. Lucy Dathan of New Canaan, Elena Kavros DeGraw of Avon and Cristin McCarthy Vahey of Fairfield.
Republican lawmakers remain opposed.
“Democrats have said this bill will make our state more affordable, jump-start our economy, and today even billed it as a solution to homelessness,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “When you promise everything to everyone, the reality is nobody gets what they’re expecting. The idea that giving private equity developers free rein will solve these problems is wishful thinking.”
Rep. Tony Scott of Monroe, the ranking House Republican on the Housing Committee, said other housing measures are sure to follow.
“This is not the end of the discussion around housing reform. In a virtual conference last month, the committee chairs announced their intent to resurrect proposals on no-fault evictions and prohibiting landlords from reviewing a prospective tenant’s criminal history. Both measures could have a chilling effect on an already strained housing market,” he said.
Also in attendance were community housing advocates furious at Lamont’s veto, which they say was him bowing to opponents who organized opposition on social media.
“We’re not always the loudest people in the public hearing or on the Facebook page, but the pro-homes movement is strong and vibrant in Connecticut. Our voices matter,” said Peter Harrison, the Connecticut director of the tristate Regional Plan Association.
He thanked supporters who had lobbied the governor, as well as Lamont for delivering on a promise to produce a substantive law.
“This is your victory, as much as it is anyone behind you,” Harrison said to advocates, then glancing at Lamont. “I do want to thank the governor for keeping his word, for getting all of us back together and getting a compromise bill.”
The Regional Plan’s affiliate is Desegregate Connecticut, which made clear after the veto that Lamont was not welcome at a national “YIMBYtown” conference it hosted in September in New Haven.
Harrison smiled Monday and noted there was “a little bit of a detour where the governor, you know, couldn’t make it.” But he was happy to stand with him on Monday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_9194-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

“What we have seen is that we have a lame duck governor and I think that the Legislature has taken back some of its co-equal power as a branch of government,” Senate Democratic Leader Lori Berman, of Boca Raton, said during a news conference in the Capitol Monday. “And I’m hopeful that as this session goes on, we in the House and the Senate in both parties are able to work together and do things that really do affect affordability and that affect peoples’ lives.”

Berman called affordability her caucus’ top priority this session. With a Republican super-majority, Democrats can’t pass legislation on their own.
“Prices are rising, period. And we are seeing Republican politicians pander to D.C. and squabble amongst themselves instead of fixing the problem, so Democrats are offering ideas,” House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell, of Tampa, said.
The leaders laid out three bills as their priorities this session.
HB 319/SB 366 would create a property insurance compact between at least 14 states, forming a risk pool for coverage. Rep. Kelly Skidmore, a Democrat from Boca Raton and the House bill’s sponsor, compared it to the National Flood Insurance Program. 
“Families are struggling, some can’t afford the cost of home ownership anymore. If we don’t tackle the risk that is driving this crisis, we will threaten that home ownership, economic growth, and the stability of our entire insurance system,” Skidmore said. 
The other housing-focused bill is HB 675/SB 756. the Housing Options Made For Everyone (HOME) Act would eliminate documentary stamp taxes for certain first-time homebuyers and build off the Live Local Act from 2023, a more-than-$700 million bipartisan measure building more workforce housing. 
“By easing just one of the up-front costs, we’re giving people a fair shot at buying their first home and starting the next chapter of their lives,” Sen. Tracie Davis, a Democrat from Jacksonville and the Senate version’s sponsor, said.
SB 780 is the caucus’ third focus, which it says will “refocus Florida’s government” by identifying “wasteful spending.” 
The bill specifically asks for investigations into high-profile items including the Everglades immigrant detention facility also known as “Alligator Alcatraz”; per student spending at New College of Florida; state spending on campaigns against proposed constitutional amendments legalizing recreational marijuana and expanding abortion access; and Hope Florida.
The bill calls for the Auditor General, Government Efficiency Task Force, and the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability to “prepare a report identifying fraud, waste, abuse of authority, malfeasance, mismanagement, and misconduct in state government.”
The bill calls for the attorney general to pursue legal remedies if the report finds wrongdoing. Attorney General James Uthmeier was appointed by DeSantis to that position and previously worked in the governor’s office.

Notably, Democrats do not include eliminating property taxes in their agenda. Republicans, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, are focusing heavily on crafting ballot language to eliminate or limit property taxes for homesteaded properties.
“What we feel is that people aren’t complaining about the property taxes, they’re complaining about the property insurance and about being able to afford things here in this state,” Berman said. “Property taxes are going to have a direct impact on the services people receive and we don’t want people to have less services here in this state.”
The session begins Jan. 13.
“Despite the president calling it a hoax, we all see with our own eyes that the affordability crisis is real, it’s hurting Floridians, and yes, it is getting worse,” Berman said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7905-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

Unionized faculty had a two-day strike in November, a rarity for Pennsylvania's community colleges. (Whitney Downard/Pennsylvania Capital-Star)With frustration mounting, unionized faculty at a central Pennsylvania community college came to an unusual decision in the early days of November this year: they were going to pressure HACC administrators at the negotiating table by leaving their classrooms for a two-day strike.
But while nearly every community college in Pennsylvania has a union, picketing professors are a rarity in the commonwealth. 
Such collective action doesn’t happen on a whim, as Chris Lilienthal told the Capital-Star. Lilienthal works as the assistant director of communications with the Pennsylvania State Education Association, which represents roughly 1,000 local union associations at K-12 schools and community colleges. 
Harrisburg Area Community College
“Strikes are very rare, both in the community college setting or the higher education setting, as well as in the K-12 setting,” said Lilienthal, speaking generally. “It’s really a situation where the negotiators on the teachers (or) faculty side have really hit a wall and they’re not getting anywhere with the school or college.” 
The full union membership votes on whether to pursue a strike — a decision union chapters at HACC and Luzerne County Community College made last month. But while HACC’s professors spent two days striking, unionized faculty at Luzerne Community College avoided such action when contract negotiations restarted. 
Similarly, the Community College of Philadelphia was able to reach a contract with faculty before a strike occurred last spring. 
“Our members, they don’t want to go on strike; they want to be in the classroom,” said Lilienthal. 
Lilienthal said negotiations for first contracts with new unions can often be lengthy, but called the three-and-a-half year process at HACC “very unusual.” The community college has campuses in Harrisburg, Lancaster, York, Gettysburg and Lebanon.
Negotiations took several, contentious turns, including arrests, alleged violations of transparency laws and accusations of union-busting. 
Despite the rocky road, union president Christine Nowik said she’d do it again. 
“I would absolutely advise it. I advise it for any industry at this point. Collective power is, at this point, the only power,” Nowik told the Capital-Star. 
Nowik, an English professor at HACC’s York campus, became president roughly one month ago, just before the strike began.
For their part, HACC administrators said they were “grateful” to reach the agreement, which was unanimously approved by the Board of Trustees last week. Most releases since the Oct. 2 vote by the union authorizing the executive committee to strike have included minimal updates, instead emphasizing the following “core principles” in a contract:

Prioritizing student success
Supporting the affordability of its offerings
Providing all employees with comparable benefits
Increasing wages for all employees while ensuring fiscal stability, as outlined in the College’s strategic plan 

 Background

The National Center for the Study of Collective Bargaining in Higher Education and the Professions reports that the number of unionized faculty grew 7.5% between 2012 and 2024, while graduate student employee unionization increased by 133%.
The center, based out of Hunter College in New York City, tabulated 902 collective bargaining units in higher education into a lengthy directory, including student and staff agreements. Each state governs and funds their community college system in a unique manner, complicating efforts to neatly categorize schools. 
The states with the highest numbers of unionized faculty are California (93,705), New York (87,848) and New Jersey (25,549). Over three-quarters of Hawaii’s faculty (76%) have union representation. 
Pennsylvania has 17,786 faculty members that are part of a union, roughly 26% of all faculty. 
Faculty members at public, two-year institutions – like HACC – were slightly more likely to belong to a union than not — whereas public and private schools were the opposite. Fifty-two percent of faculty at two-year institutions belong to a union, compared to 33% of public, four-year faculty members and 8% of those teaching at private schools. 
According to the center’s directory, just one of the commonwealth’s 15 community colleges doesn’t have a faculty union: Erie County Community College.

The Pennsylvania State Education Association represents six community colleges, while the remaining eight schools have affiliates under the state chapter of the American Federation of Teachers.
Lilienthal said salaries and benefits were common motivations for organizing, whether at a community college or a K-12 school, alongside working conditions like classroom sizes. 
“They’ve put a lot of time and a lot of money into becoming those professionals and into building those professional credentials. They deserve to be paid commensurate with that,” said Lilienthal. 
The union at HACC represents faculty members at all five campuses. Though compensation and benefits played a role in the decision to form a collective bargaining unit, Nowik said working conditions became “untenable,” pointing at HACC administrators. 
“The trajectory of this style of leadership has not been a good fit for the organization,” said Nowik. “It’s morally injurious for us not to push back on the things that we know are directly harmful to students.”
 Moving forward

Pennsylvania has a long history with the labor movement and remains a strong union enclave, allowing for collective bargaining under both the Pennsylvania Labor Relations Act and the Public Employee Relations Act. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that 12.4% of working Pennsylvanians are represented by a union. 
Despite this familiarity, Nowik said that central Pennsylvania didn’t have the same approach, contributing to the list of reasons why HACC is one of the last schools to unionize, despite being the largest and oldest community college in the state.

Most peer schools appear to have established their collective bargaining units back in the 1970s. 
“This faculty here has been so beaten down and stripped of any voice and power. That feels very disconcerting; it feels very unsettling,” said Nowik. 
Union membership has been falling nationwide for decades, but Nowik said she believed that Generation Z would turn the tide, in part due to frustrations related to power inequality and wage disparities.

Surrounded by peers from different organizations representing Utah teachers, local government employees, police officers, municipal workers and more, Scott Stephenson, executive director of the Utah Fraternal Order of Police said he was “optimistically happy that this could potentially happen tomorrow.”

“The referendum. All the signatures. Over 5,000 volunteers, 320,000 signatures in 30 days. That’s awesome,” Stephenson said. “That’s not a message. That’s an indictment to the Legislature. Going into these negotiations, knowing that 320,000 people support us, gave us a lot of leverage.”
With enough signatures confirmed, controversial union law put on hold

Protect Utah Workers, a coalition of public and private unions that pushed hard to repeal the law, had been in negotiations with lawmakers for the past month and a half, Stephenson said.
“To their credit, they listened to us and they agreed with us that this is what needs to happen,” he said.
The legislation was scheduled to become effective in July, but was put on hold as unions quickly surpassed the signature threshold for a ballot initiative that could have repealed the bill. 
Gov. Spencer Cox signed the bill within days of it passing. However, in a social media post Sunday, Cox said he supports the repeal.
“(I) appreciate the Legislature’s work to refocus this conversation to ensure government is doing its best to support our first responders, educators, and all those who serve our state,” he wrote.
Utah Senate President Stuart Adams and House Speaker Mike Schultz announced Sunday night that the Legislature would consider repealing HB267, titled Public Sector Labor Union Amendments, during the special session scheduled Tuesday.
“It’s clear that the heated debate around these issues has created unnecessary division, which was never the intent,” Adams and Schultz said in a release. “Repealing the bill allows us to reset the discussion and move forward to ensure we get this right.”
Now, the release says, legislative leaders and the unions are committed to working together in good faith on future proposals. 



Let us know what you think...


 


If HB267 had become effective, it would have prohibited public sector unions from negotiating terms of employment with their employers, an action that union members described as an existential threat. Proponents, however, said the bill would protect taxpayer dollars and give all public employees a voice, not just union members. 
It was the third year legislators had made a proposal aiming to change how public unions negotiate contracts with their employers. 
Renée Pinkney, president of the Utah Education Association, the state’s largest teachers’ union, said on Monday she expects the Legislature to repeal the bill during the special session. However, she doesn’t think this will be the end of the unions’ fight.
“We’ll be working together (with legislators) in a work group in order to move forward,” Pinkney said. 
If lawmakers vote to repeal the bill on Tuesday, they will be doing the same thing that would have happened at the polls, Pinkney said. 
“We know that this is a win for the voters, and it’s a win for all of the volunteers. We had 5,000 volunteers who helped us gather signatures,” Pinkney said. “The resources that were expended, time, people and money, we are just incredibly appreciative of all of those people who helped us, and we are appreciative that the Legislature listened to those people.”
While union leaders are happy with the outcome, they have also received comments from concerned voters, who worry that had the question gone to the ballot in 2026, it would have provided stronger protections to unions, especially with the Utah Supreme Court decision on an anti-gerrymandering lawsuit, that said “an initiative is constitutionally protected from government infringement.”
“That’s some of the comments I’ve been given because you have the redistricting issue, that’s a very important issue for people to get involved in,” Stephenson said. “And they were just hoping that there’s one less thing that they have to worry about.”
The ballot initiative may no longer be an issue in the 2026 midterms, Stephenson said, but with other questions and elections on the line, he encourages Utahns to still show up at the polls to make their voices heard.

Jackley was chosen as president-elect Monday by the nation’s attorneys general at their annual meeting in Washington, D.C. He had been serving as vice president for the past year.
“I am honored to serve alongside my fellow attorneys general as we enforce our state laws and promote sound law enforcement policies for our communities,” Jackley said in a news release. “Serving in this leadership role will strengthen my ability to address issues on a national level that are important to South Dakota.”

Jackley was previously elected president of the group in 2015, and was the first South Dakota attorney general to lead the association. Members are the attorneys general of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, the commonwealths of Puerto Rico and the Northern Mariana Islands, and the territories of American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands.
Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, who had been serving as president-elect, will be the association’s president for the coming year while Jackley serves as president-elect.
In the June 2026 primary election, Jackley is seeking the Republican nomination to run for South Dakota’s lone U.S. House seat. The current holder of the seat, Republican Rep. Dusty Johnson, is running for governor.
In a statement to South Dakota Searchlight, Jackley said he’s “focused on serving as the best attorney general I can be for South Dakota and president-elect of our nation’s attorneys general.” But, he added, “if blessed by the people of South Dakota, I will be a strong voice and leader for us in Congress.”
If Jackley wins the Republican nomination for U.S. House and also wins in the November 2026 general election, he would become a member of Congress in January 2027.",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/NAAG-OFFICERS-2026-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Getty Images)A startup that seeks to build the first-ever power grid in outer space has selected Albuquerque as its headquarters, the state Economic Development Department announced Monday.
Mantis Space, a Georgia-founded company that is backed by venture capital, plans to build orbital infrastructure capable of powering satellites and lunar operations, according to a news release. The new Albuquerque headquarters and research and development facilities are expected to generate as much as $480 million in economic impact over the next 10 years, the release said. Company officials expect to create more than 200 jobs with average annual salaries of more than $180,000. 
Company officials say they chose Albuquerque after a national search and weighed factors such as quality of life, access to talent and available economic incentives. The state is awarding the company $2.5 million under the Local Economic Development Act and Albuquerque is awarding it $500,000. 
“Albuquerque exceeded nearly all our criteria for our highly competitive selection and offered an extremely competitive package that was ultimately the key,” Mantis Space CEO Eric Truitt said in a statement. “We look forward to working together to make New Mexico a national leader in both space and advanced energy innovation.”
The state Economic Development Department in a release said orbital infrastructure is expected to pave the way for “off-planet data centers and manufacturing.”
High-tech projects have increasingly announced plans to open in New Mexico. In September, local officials approved plans for Project Jupiter, a campus of data centers planned to support the tech giants OpenAI and Oracle. That same month, Pacific Fusion, a California-based fusion energy company, announced plans to build a $1 billion research and manufacturing campus in Albuquerque. And in November, a California-based hypersonic missile company announced plans to open a 1,000-acre manufacturing plant in Sandoval County.
The state Economic Development Department in early December released a 158-page report that calls for further growth in science and technology fields including quantum systems, advanced energy and aerospace.
“New Mexico is rapidly becoming an anchor for our nation’s most advanced industries, as today’s exciting announcement demonstrates,” New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham said in a statement. “With our world-class research institutions, unmatched talent, and growing network of innovative companies, our state is literally shaping the future.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/satelliteGettyImages-2198257968-1024x640.jpg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Photo: charlottenc.gov)A second stabbing on Charlotte’s public transit system, this time by a man who was allegedly in the United States illegally, has drawn national attention as Republican leaders voice support for the immigration crackdown in the state.
On Dec. 5, Oscar Solarzano, 33, boarded a Blue Line light rail train at New Bern Station while intoxicated and began yelling at passengers, according to an arrest affidavit by Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police. When passenger Kenyon Dobie asked him to stop shouting, Solarzano allegedly confronted him and challenged him to a fight.
Dobie asked Solarzano to back away and then pushed him against a seat when he refused. Solarzano rose and drew a large knife from his pocket and allegedly stabbed Dobie in the chest, the affidavit states.
Solarzano allegedly fled the scene and was arrested shortly afterward, according to the affidavit. Officers stated that he confessed to the stabbing after being informed of his right to remain silent. Solarzano did not know Dobie prior to the incident.
Solarzano is charged with felony attempted murder and aggravated assault. The affidavit states that he was previously banned from Charlotte Area Transit System trains, resulting in an additional charge of breaking and entering.
The Charlotte Public Defender’s office, which is representing Solarzano, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Dobie wrote on a GoFundMe page that he has been hospitalized and the attack caused him to bleed into his lungs. “Luckily I survived but my body has taken plenty damage,” he wrote. “Please pray and help me with a better recovery.”
Dobie’s stabbing is the second high-profile act of violence on Charlotte’s transit system this year after the fatal stabbing of Ukrainian refugees Iryna Zarutska in September led to the passage of a strict crime bill known as “Iryna’s Law” tightening pre-trial release requirements and seeking to resume the death penalty.
That law took effect on Dec. 1, days before Dobie was stabbed. In a Monday morning order, a Mecklenburg County judge denied Solarzano bond and found that he could not be determined to have legal residence in the United States.
Immigration and Customs Enforcement issued a detainer order for Solarzano on the morning of Dec. 6, according to court records, finding that he is subject to a final order of removal and had illegally reentered the United States after a previous removal. A Mecklenburg County magistrate judge also noted that he had been deported previously.
The stabbing comes amid ongoing operations by Customs and Border Patrol and ICE throughout North Carolina, with more than 425 individuals detained in Charlotte since November. Republican leaders in the state and across the nation quickly circulated the story as proof of the need for better  immigration enforcement in the state.
“Another stabbing by an Illegal Migrant in Charlotte, North Carolina,” President Donald Trump wrote on Truth Social Dec. 6. “What’s going on in Charlotte? Democrats are destroying it, like everything else, piece by piece!!!”
State Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham) blamed Gov. Josh Stein for the attack, writing in a post on X that “Gov. Stein and the Democrats need to stop coddling criminal illegal aliens.”
North Carolina House Speaker Destin Hall said on social media that the attack is evidence Stein must do more to cooperate with Homeland Security operations in the state.
“The stabbing on the Charlotte light rail last night was committed by an illegal alien. @DHSgov is working to detain as many criminals as possible, but we need stronger cooperation from the “leaders” in our state,” Hall wrote. “@NC_Governor, it’s time to step up and do more to protect NC citizens.”
In a statement Monday afternoon, Stein spokesperson Olivia Weidie said that public safety is the Governor’s top priority and that he supports immigration enforcement.
“He has always said that violent criminals who entered our country illegally should be deported. This is no exception,” she wrote. “Governor Stein is committed to making sure people feel safe going about their daily lives, and he is grateful that Chief Patterson was already surging law enforcement throughout Charlotte with Operation Safe Season.”
Stein wrote in a social media post Dec. 5 that he has been in communication with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police since the stabbing.
“Please join me in praying for the full recovery of the victim,” Stein wrote. “I am grateful to the state law enforcement agencies that are assisting the operation. Public safety is a top priority for us all.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/CATS-New-Bern-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Photo by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Iowa Democrats largely agree that they want to return to their historical spot as an early state in the 2028 Democratic presidential nominating cycle, according to survey results released by the Iowa Democratic Party.
In August, IDP officials announced they were conducting a survey among Iowa Democratic voters about the future of the state’s Democratic presidential caucuses. The national party booted Iowa from its longtime first-in-the-nation position in the 2024 presidential nominating cycle. While Democratic National Committee officials have said they plan to change the nominating calendar ahead of 2028, 2020 reporting issues and Democrats’ concerns about caucuses being less accessible than primaries are hampering Iowa’s chances of regaining an early state spot in the new calendar.
But even if the DNC does not approve Iowa holding its caucuses early, the state party could still decide to hold an unsanctioned presidential nominating contest — a move New Hampshire, the longtime first-in-the-nation primary, took in 2024 when the national party had South Carolina lead the nominating calendar.

The results of the survey were released Saturday, when the IDP State Central Committee met to discuss the results as well as next steps for how to structure the caucuses in 2028 — and how to approach conversations with national Democrats about Iowa’s role in the nominating process. Iowa Democratic Party Chair Rita Hart thanked Iowans for participating in the survey in a video about the “first round”  of survey results.
“The bottom line is that Iowans must have an early role in the 2028 Democratic presidential nominating process,” Hart said. “And, our party-run process needs to be more accessible and inclusive. That’s what our fellow Democrats have said.”
According to the report submitted to the State Central Committee, 65.3% of the more than 750 Iowans surveyed said they want Iowa to be first or early in the nominating process. The largest portion of that group — 44.7% — said they want Iowa’s nominating contest to be first in the Democrats’ calendar, and 20.6% said they support Iowa being in the early window. The survey also found 12.6% Iowans said they support Iowa holding a contest on Super Tuesday or later, and 22% said they do not care when Iowa holds its contest.
Though the survey found Iowans want to hold a caucus early in the nominating cycle, 51.1% of Iowans said they do not believe Iowa should defy the DNC calendar, “even if it means Iowa is not in the early window.” Just over a third of respondents, 34.4%, said they support working through the DNC process of restructuring the nominating calendar but defying the calendar if Iowa’s plan is not accepted, similar to New Hampshire’s decision in 2024, while 14.4% said Iowa Democrats should give “no consideration” to the DNC process.
The report recommended the IDP seek a waiver to participate in the early contest window from the national party by Jan. 16, 2026 — the deadline for states to submit their request to the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee — but details were not shared on further steps.
“There is still a long way to go before an early window calendar is finalized,” Hart said. “And there’s still a lot of conversations with the DNC and with my fellow Democrats that need to be had.”

Ann-Margaret Ferrante intends to run for the open 5th Essex District seat and a former Rockport selectwoman also plans to jump into the race.
Both Democrats filed papers Monday to set up candidate committees in the House district that includes Essex, Rockport, Manchester-by-the Sea and Gloucester. 
Ferrante, 53, died on Thanksgiving after a yearslong battle with pancreatic cancer. More than 1,600 people attended her funeral last week.
Dru Tarr, research and district director in Ferrante’s office, said he has the experience “to continue a legacy of service in delivering for the people of Cape Ann.”
A lifelong Gloucester resident, Tarr said his early supporters include Ferrante’s mother, two former Gloucester mayors, four city councilors, a school committee member and Register of Deeds Eileen Duff.
“I have spent the past nine years tutoring under the best mentor one could possibly have asked for,” Tarr wrote in a Facebook post. “Ann-Margaret Ferrante was not just my state rep, she was my teacher and friend. Every day with Ann-Margaret was a lesson. The legacy that she leaves is not just one of policies and programs, but of the people that she lifted up through her actions. I count myself fortunate to be among them.”
Tarr told the News Service Monday that he never considered running for public office.
“I really wish that my friend was still here to be the one doing the job,” he said.
With the 2026 elections set to unfold, Speaker Ron Mariano’s office on Monday did not respond to questions about a potential special election. State law does not specify a time frame to call for a special election. 
A special election was called on Dec. 7, 2023 to fill former Rep. Peter Durant’s seat after he won his Senate bid. Mariano’s office in February 2024 decided not to hold a special election to fill the vacancy left by Rep. Josh Cutler after he resigned to join the Healey administration. 
Sarah Wilkinson, who served on the Rockport Select Board for 18 years, intends to run for Ferrante’s seat. 
“At her beautiful funeral service yesterday State Senator Bruce Tarr encouraged those of us in attendance to move forward and share the light that Ann-Margaret was,” Wilkinson wrote in a Facebook post Friday afternoon. “His words were both inspiring and overwhelming to me. Inspiring because as many of you know, my whole life I have felt a calling to serve others and my community. That calling is now louder now than ever before. Overwhelming because Ann-Margaret leaves enormous shoes to fill as she was the true definition of a faithful and dedicated public servant.”
Wilkinson called Cape Ann “one of the most special places on Earth” and said she wanted to share her decision “as we wait for the release of the details of the Special election.”
Dru Tarr told the News Service that he had not heard any details about the timing for a special election but said it’s his “understanding” that “there would be one called.”
Ferrante was first elected to the 5th Essex seat in 2008. Before Ferrante, the 5th Essex House district was represented by Rep.

Amara and Nick followed separate dreams: speech therapy for her, real estate for him. With the support of mentors who helped them navigate their opportunities, both went west—building lives that are grounded in the values they grew up with.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Different roads, same roots: Twins from Pownal forge independent futures.","Amara and Nick with their mom at Amara’s wedding.
Amara Chester and Nick Armstrong are twins. They say that many assume they share the exact same interests—but when it came to their education and career, each followed their own path. 
They grew up in Pownal in the furthest southwest corner of the state. From a young age (thanks to a steady message from their mom), Amara and Nick knew that education could open doors for them. “Mom was clear she didn’t want us to stay in our hometown,” Nick said. “She wanted us to see the world. If we came back later, that was fine, but she wanted us to see something else first.” While their mom hadn’t gone to college herself, she encouraged the twins and their older sister to think out of their comfort zones when it came to their futures. 
So they did, stretching their wings to the west coast to pursue their passions. For Amara, it’s speech pathology. For Nick, it’s an entrepreneurial approach to real estate. 
Amara discovered speech pathology (and her future) in California 
In high school, Amara thought she might go into the medical field because she shared the mindset of her older sister who became a nurse. She knew she wanted a career with strong personal connections. “I was interested in as much interpersonal interaction as possible,” she said. A human services class her high school, Mount Anthony Union in Bennington, introduced her to additional career ideas—and it included a skills test that suggested speech pathology. “I had never even heard of speech pathology before, but the more I looked into it, the more I liked the idea. I liked that it was care and support in a non-emergency setting.”
As Amara began searching for colleges, she looked for schools with three criteria: a major in communication sciences, a Christian college, and warm weather far from home. She typed one simple phrase into Google: “Christian colleges with warm weather and speech pathology.” That search led her to Biola University in California. Of the three colleges she ultimately applied to, Biola offered the strongest financial aid package, which deepened its appeal.
Amara says that Monda Kelley, an Outreach Counselor with VSAC’s Talent Search program, played a huge role in that outcome. “My entire junior and senior year I was writing scholarship applications every week,” she said. “Monda printed this big list of scholarships for me. We even found one for people who are left-handed, like me.” She remembers her mom sitting in the library during meetings and working beside her. “It was always collaborative. We would not have had that level of information without VSAC.”
Amara’s first plane ride—ever—took her to California for college. At Biola, she earned a bachelor’s degree in speech disorders and then completed her master’s degree in Speech Language Pathology. Far from home, Amara found community through the Torrey Honors program. “We had three-hour book discussions twice a week. I love reading, and that was a huge draw for me,” she said.
Today, Amara lives in Huntington Beach with her husband, Zach, and their six-month-old child. She works at a nonprofit called the Brain Rehabilitative and Injury Network, which helps people who have experienced traumatic brain injuries, strokes, or conditions like dementia. “A lot of clients have used up their insurance, and they can’t afford the therapy they still need,” she explained. “We don’t turn people away because of finances. We can give scholarships as needed.”
Her focus is cognitive therapy, helping people rebuild thinking and communication skills. And, after becoming a mom herself recently, she appreciates that her job has flexibility. “Maintaining my license is important to me, and I love being a mom. I’m trying to balance both.”
Looking back, she feels certain that VSAC made a major difference. “We were first-generation. We didn’t know the process or the culture around college. Without VSAC, I would not have known where to look for scholarships. A good chunk of my first two years was covered because of what they helped me find.”
Nick built a career through real estate and entrepreneurship
Nick’s path, although nothing like his sister’s, was similarly unique and exploratory. As a teenager, he thought he wanted to be a pharmacist. He later switched to accounting and a real turning point came when he took a marketing internship during his junior year of college. “It sounded better than the pizza job I had,” he said. “Once I started the internship at Keller Williams, I was exposed to the real estate world, and that was my ticket.”
He now lives in Albuquerque, New Mexico, and works as a real estate broker. Nick also owns investment properties that he manages and improves himself. He learned a lot of his home improvement skills working for a general contractor when he was in high school in Vermont.
Nick also worked with VSAC Outreach Counselor Monda Kelley, and says that back in those early high school days, VSAC helped him simply get started. “VSAC was one of those opportunities you didn’t really know about until you were sitting there at the table,” he said. “The biggest thing I noticed was Monda’s desire to see us win. It didn’t matter what our plan was. It mattered that we had one and had structure behind it.”
He remembers that the applications, but especially the fees that accompany them, felt overwhelming. “The first barrier to entry is really the fees,” he said. “Something that helped me a lot was that I didn’t have to worry about that because VSAC was there.” Then the financial aid packages arrived, and he weighed them carefully. “I’ve always been very frugal. I needed a school that fit both my goals and my budget.”
The University of New Mexico offered a strong package, and Nick accepted. After college, he earned his real estate license and bought his first investment property. He now helps clients buy and sell homes, renovates properties he owns, and continues to grow his business. “Real estate is one of those things where longevity pays off,” he said. As for his future? “I want to open a property management company in the next ten years.”
Nick still remembers two adults who shaped his high school years. One was Monda, his VSAC counselor. The other was his AP Biology teacher at Mount Anthony, Mr. Cross. “He changed my perception of what college could be,” Nick said. “He would play the song ‘Build Me Up Buttercup’ every morning to set the vibe. I heard it just the other day and texted it to my sister. Every time I hear it, I think about what his influence meant to me.”
Separate paths, shared support
The twins live far apart now, far from their Vermont roots. Amara and Nick visit a few times a year and stay close, even as their adult lives look very different.
Both say that VSAC changed what they believed was possible after high school. “I feel very blessed to have landed where I did,” Nick said. Amara echoed the same feeling. “There were so many opportunities that I would not have known about,” she said.

Free.,US Education Department civil rights staff returning to work to tackle complaint backlog,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-education-department-civil-rights-staff-returning-work-tackle-complaint-backlog,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Education Department is bringing back hundreds of employees in its Office for Civil Rights who were placed on paid administrative leave earlier this year, according to a Dec. 5 email to those employees obtained by States Newsroom. The effort came as the Office for Civil Rights, or OCR — which is tasked with investigating civil rights complaints from students and families — has seen a growth in its massive backlog of those complaints. A spokesperson for the department confirmed the effort and said the staffers would resume work starting Dec. 15.Dismantling of departmentMore than 200 OCR employees targeted as part of a larger Reduction in Force, or RIF, effort at the Education Department in March were placed on administrative leave amid legal challenges against President Donald Trump’s administration.Since taking office in January, Trump has sought to dismantle the 46-year-old agency in his quest to move education “back to the states.” He tapped Education Secretary Linda McMahon to fulfill that mission. “The Department will continue to appeal the persistent and unceasing litigation disputes concerning the Reductions in Force, but in the meantime, it will utilize all employees currently being compensated by American taxpayers,” Julie Hartman, a spokesperson for the department, said in a statement shared with States Newsroom.In the email to employees, the department said “it is important to refocus OCR’s work and utilize all OCR staff to prioritize OCR’s existing complaint caseload.” “In order for OCR to pursue its mission with all available resources, all those individuals currently being compensated by the Department need to meet their employee performance expectations and contribute to the enforcement of existing civil rights complaints,” the email notes.The agency did not respond to States Newsroom’s separate requests to confirm the text of the email. It is unclear how many of the more than 200 will return, or if some have taken other jobs.Union says millions of dollars wastedRachel Gittleman, president of American Federation of Government Employees Local 252, which represents Education Department workers, said that “for more than nine months, hundreds of employees at the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) have been sidelined from the critical work of protecting our nation’s most vulnerable students and families.”“Instead of following court orders and federal law, the Trump Administration chose to keep these civil rights professionals on paid administrative leave — a decision that has already wasted more than $40 million in taxpayer funds — rather than letting them do their jobs,” she said. Gittleman pointed to “severe” consequences, noting that “by blocking OCR staff from doing their jobs, Department leadership allowed a massive backlog of civil rights complaints to grow, and now expects these same employees to clean up a crisis entirely of the Department’s own making.”",,,,2025-12-08 16:57:57.471005

(Photo by Andrew Weeks/For the North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota K-12 students continue to make gains in becoming ready for college or career paths after high school, according to new data released by the Department of Public Instruction.
On Friday, the department released its statewide performance and assessment data for the 2024-25 school year that provides information on graduation rates, English and math proficiency and other statistics.
Federal law requires state education agencies to provide an accountability report for every public school in the state.
“Honest competition and transparency help make everyone better,” said State School Superintendent Levi Bachmeier in a statement. “This information helps districts understand who to look to for best practices and helps citizens ask thoughtful questions about educational outcomes.”
The data showed a 2% increase in students considered “Choice Ready” over the previous year, increasing to 73% of all North Dakota students. A student can become Choice Ready for post-secondary education, military service, workforce or essential skills, through courses and other opportunities offered at their schools. 
During the 2020-21 school year, 45% of North Dakota students were considered Choice Ready, according to the data.
The department began implementing the Choice Ready framework during the 2018-19 school year with the goal of making students ready to choose any career path after leaving high school, said Amanda Peterson, director of educational improvement and support for the Department of Public Instruction. 
“It’s not necessarily a student making a conscious choice on which bucket they fall in. It’s a school offering opportunities in all three buckets, including the essential skills, so that a student can be prepared for any field they want to go into,” Peterson said.
She said students’ aspirations can change over time, but skills in math and English are needed for college and employment opportunities.
“Employers really want students to be able to critically think, be strong in all of the subject areas needed and they really need to be strong readers as well in order to be successful in life,” Peterson said.
Cellphone ban means less drama, more focus for some North Dakota students

Student graduation rates remained relatively flat with 84% of students receiving their high school diplomas within four years of entering high school. That rate was 82% last year and 83% in 2022-23.
The data showed a 7% increase in the four-year graduation rate for North Dakota Native American students, from 63% to 70% in the 2024-25 school year.
Peterson said the “completer rate” is a better metric because it takes into account students who receive their diploma or pass the General Education Development test before age 22. It also includes some special education students who may attend school until age 21.
North Dakota’s “completer rate” was 92% for the 2024-25 school year, up from 91% last year and 90% during the 2022-23 school year.

Data may not be available for some categories that have fewer than 10 students due to privacy concerns, the department said.   
The department changed its test provider, platform and questions used to measure English, math and science proficiency for the 2024-25 assessment. The scores are:

English: 40% advanced or proficient, 42% approaching proficiency and 18% novice level
Math: 41% advanced or proficient, 29% approaching proficiency and 29% novice level
Science: 38% advanced or proficient, 29% approaching proficiency and 32% novice level

Chronic absenteeism, students who missed more than 10% of school days during the year, remained flat at 20% of students, the same percentage since the 2022-23 school year.

The Republican representative adds to a recent spate of departures among legislators.

Rep. Jim Harrison, R-Chittenden, plans to step down as representative of the Rutland-11 district —  comprising Killington, Chittenden, Mendon and Pittsfield — according to an announcement last week. 
Harrison was appointed to the seat by Phil Scott in 2017, after his predecessor, former Rep. Job Tate, resigned for overseas Navy deployment. Harrison has since been elected to the post for four consecutive terms and served as vice chair for the House Committee on Appropriations last session.
Harrison’s resignation is the fifth in a string of apparently unrelated departures from the state Legislature since June. Harrison was considered among his peers as a moderate and influential member. 
“I just tried to bring a pragmatic sense to each and every issue that was before us,” the representative said.  
Killington Republican chair Chuck Hughes said that members of the four towns in the district will gather on Dec. 17 to discuss potential candidates to put forward to Gov. Phil Scott for appointment to replace Harrison. 
“It’s a big loss for our area, because he was very active,” Hughes said. “He would listen to people, you know, that was one of his strong features of being a representative. He was there to represent the people.”
Before his tenure as a representative, Harrison led the organization now-called the Vermont Retail and Grocers Association for 29 years, lobbying for retailers interests in the statehouse. 
After 19 years living in Chittenden, Harrison said he and his wife plan to move to New Hampshire to be closer to family, necessitating his departure from his political post. 
Harrison said he will close out his tenure at noon on the first day of the session, Jan. 6, so he can say goodbye to long-time colleagues and still ensure his successor has time to step into the role. 
Focused on affordability and lower taxes for Vermonters living in his district and the state, Harrison said that he worked with the House Committee on Appropriations to trim the budget last year and come to consensus on funding priorities.
In a Monday statement, Gov. Phil Scott expressed appreciation for Harrison’s years of work, “especially on the House Appropriations committee, to make Vermont more affordable.”
Along with advocating for a frugal state budget, Harrison aimed to foster bipartisanship in Montpelier as the self-appointed tournament organizer of a statehouse-wide March Madness bracket. 
“It’s all about having some fun and building bridges,” Harrison said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-08 20:42:02+00:00,CT Mirror,Rep. Jim Himes wants Venezuela boat strike video made public,Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/jim-himes-boat-strikes-pete-hegseth/,U.S. Rep. Jim Himes was one of only a handful of lawmakers authorized to view the classified video of deadly boat strikes in the Caribbean.,"As the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, U.S. Rep. Jim Himes was one of only a handful of lawmakers authorized to view the classified video of deadly boat strikes in the Caribbean.
Now, he wants the footage of the strikes from early September released so the public can judge for itself.
In an interview on CBS’ “Face the Nation,” the southwestern Connecticut congressman described parts of the video, which he says showed two survivors “clinging to a piece of wood and about to go under” after the first strike by U.S. forces on an alleged drug boat near Venezuela. A second strike was carried out and killed the remaining survivors.
The so-called “double tap” strikes on Sept. 2 have come under intense scrutiny on Capitol Hill, as well as whether the strikes were carried out legally. But Democratic and Republican lawmakers have different interpretations of what they saw on the video — a reason why Himes hopes it can be made available for everyone to see.
“I’ve spent years looking at videos of lethal action taken, often in the terrorism context, and this video was profoundly shaken, and I think it’s important for Americans to see it,” Himes said in the Sunday interview. “It’s not lost on anyone, of course, that the interpretation of the video, which six or seven of us had an opportunity to see last week, broke down precisely on party lines. And so this is an instance in which I think the American public needs to judge for itself.”
Himes said the people on the boat were “almost certainly running drugs,” but that it was unclear if they were headed to the U.S. or elsewhere. He disputed characterizations that all 11 people on the boat were high-level targets or that they knew the identifies of everyone on board.
“Under the law, if someone has been struck and continues to engage in hostilities, points a gun at you, has a gun, they may be a legitimate target. But if they are outside of combat, they are not, and attacking them is a violation of the laws of war,” he said. “This is why the American people need to see this video. These guys were barely alive, much less engaging in hostilities.”
President Donald Trump said last week he supports the public release of the video. During an appearance over the weekend at the Reagan National Defense Forum, U.S. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth said they’re reviewing sources and methods first since it’s an ongoing operation.
Himes and other Democrats who viewed the classified video offered different accounts of what they watched compared to Republican lawmakers who were also privy to it.
U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has defended the strikes and said they were valid targets. He also doesn’t oppose the public release of the video but echoed Hegseth’s remarks about how to go about carefully declassifying it.
“They were not floating in the ocean on a wooden plank, or in life jackets. They were  on the capsized vessel. They were not incapacitated in any way,” Cotton said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “It was entirely appropriate to strike the boat again to make sure that its cargo was destroyed. It is in no way a violation of the war of law.”
As key members on their respective intelligence committees, both Himes and Cotton had private briefings with Navy Admiral Frank M. Bradley, who commanded the operation, and Gen. Dan Caine, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Similarly, U.S. Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and other Democrats on the House Armed Services Committee have also requested that Hegseth release all audio and video footage of the strikes. They cited reporting from The Washington Post that Hegseth issued a “kill everybody” order. Hegseth has disputed that and said he left the room after the first strike. But in an interview over the weekend, he said, “I would have made the same call myself” about the follow-up strike.
Himes said lawmakers received different explanations about the strikes, which is why he lacks trust in Hegseth. The congressman told CBS they were initially told that a second strike was ordered to clear the wreckage to help with navigation. Himes said he was then told that they might have a radio and were potentially trying to recover the drugs. Once he watched the video, Himes said, “You realize they don’t have a radio.”
“There was a lot of lack of clarity over exactly what Pete Hegseth’s role here was, but Pete Hegseth has no credibility on this matter,” Himes said. “So what we’ve had is a series of shifting explanations.”
When asked if he retains confidence in Bradley, Himes had a different take on the admiral’s role and capabilities.
“What it raises is what happens when an apparently good man like Admiral Bradley is placed in a context where he knows that if he countermands an order that he is perhaps uncomfortable with, it is very likely that he will be fired,” Himes said.
As the Pentagon grapples with the strikes, the inspector general of the department released a report last week about Hegseth’s use of the encrypted messaging app Signal to discuss an imminent attack on Houthi targets in Yemen earlier this year. The report found using a personal cell phone to conduct business and send nonpublic information over Signal could have put U.S. forces and mission objectives at risk.
It came to light after a journalist from The Atlantic was inadvertently added to a group chat where officials were discussing the plans of the pending attack back in March.
On Sunday, Himes told CBS that Republican lawmakers are privately expressing concerns about what has been referred to as Signalgate, despite the department calling the report a “total exoneration” and Hegseth maintaining he didn’t share classified information.
Members of Connecticut’s congressional delegation have recently called on Hegseth to resign in light of the boat strikes and his use of Signal to discuss attack plans.
“From leaking classified war plans in a group text to going around Congress and the President of the United States to halt weapons shipments to our ally Ukraine, Pete Hegseth has shown a repeated pattern of unbecoming conduct since the minute he was sworn in as Secretary of Defense,” U.S. Rep. John Larson, D-1st District, said in a statement. “He is clearly unfit to serve and needs evaluation.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-27-at-5.44.33 PM-1024x567.png,,,2025-12-08 15:59:13.303734

(Photo courtesy of Western Iowa Tech Community College)A former psychology instructor is suing Western Iowa Tech Community College for alleged discrimination in its handling of her complaint that she was being stalked by a student.
Mariana Pacheco, who describes herself in court papers as a young, Hispanic academic from Costa Rica, is suing WITCC in Woodbury County District Court.
The lawsuit alleges that in 2022, when Pacheco was teaching a beginning-level course in psychology at the Sioux City college, a student, identified in court filings by the initials M.U., exhibited “odd behavior” toward her, would wait for her after class, and would block her from leaving the classroom.

At one point, the lawsuit alleges, M.U. told Pacheco he had been “kicked out” of the military and not allowed to become a police officer due to several psychiatric conditions.
Throughout the fall 2022 semester, Pacheco alleges, she noticed M.U. following her around campus. She then notified her direct supervisor and the school’s dean of opportunity of engagement, but no action was taken, according to the lawsuit.
In the spring of 2023, when Pacheco taught developmental psychology, M.U. allegedly enrolled in the course.  In one class exercise, students were instructed to use ink pens as a device, but M.U. allegedly substituted AR-15 bullets for the pens.
When Pacheco taught an abnormal psychology course in the fall of 2023, M.U. enrolled and sent her an email informing her that “a Latino guy” had approached him at a bus stop and threatened him with a knife, adding that “this experience reminded me of why I normally carry a gun as I could’ve ended it two ways. Either de-escalation or with him dead.”
According to the lawsuit, while Pacheco was teaching a course on forensic psychology in early 2024, she noticed M.U. outside her classroom, circling the room three to five times every class period and making eye contact with her as he passed by.
Pacheco reported her concerns to WITCC officials who dismissed her concerns, the lawsuit claims, adding that security officials “said that there were other security officers in the office that were smaller and older than Mariana, and they were not scared of M.U., so she should not fear him either. Mariana pointed out that WITCC security officials are armed, while Mariana is not.”
One of the security officers allegedly suggested that had M.U. been a Somalian student, they would intercede because Somalian students had “trouble” with female instructors.
The lawsuit claims that in February 2024, three WITCC administrators allegedly observed M.U. circling Pacheco’s classroom and contacted campus security. Pacheco’s direct supervisor subsequently agreed that either she or her secretary would escort Pacheco to and from class, but with the understanding that if they were unable to do so, there would be no one else available since campus security had declined to offer such assistance.
According to the lawsuit, Pacheco then met WITCC’s president, Terry Murrell, to discuss her concerns. Murrell allegedly suggested Pacheco teach remotely, via Zoom, until any safety concerns could be addressed. However, the lawsuit alleges, the school subsequently decided not to file a harassment complaint against the student on Pacheco’s behalf and it also required her to conduct her classes in person.
The lawsuit alleges that around this time, WITCC permitted a different instructor, who is white, to teach remotely after she had expressed similar concerns related to a different student. On March 29, 2024, Pacheco resigned from WITCC.
Her lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for negligence; third-party sexual harassment; discrimination based on race, skin color or national origin; retaliatory discharge, and violations of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Americans with Disabilities Act.
WITCC has yet to file a response to the lawsuit. A spokesperson for the school indicated it does not comment on pending litigation.

(Photo by Christopher Shea/Rhode Island Current)Boston’s First Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday dismissed the Trump administration’s appeal of a Rhode Island judge’s Nov. 6 order directing the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to fully fund the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) while the federal government remained closed.
The call to drop that appeal was made by the administration itself, according to the two-page judgment.
A USDA spokesperson declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation for Rhode Island State Council of Churches v. Brooke Rollins still before Chief Judge John J. McConnell in Providence. The spokesperson referred additional inquiry to the U.S. Department of Justice, which did not immediately respond to request for comment. 
The 43-day federal government shutdown ended on Nov. 12. Even before the president signed the package ending the longest shutdown in U.S. history, the USDA promised federal food benefits would resume within 24 hours of the government reopening. The administration then withdrew its request that the U.S. Supreme Court halt McConnell’s order requiring full food stamp payments.
“The case was dismissed because of the government reopening,” Democracy Forward Press Secretary Amahree Archie, whose national group represented some of the 20 plaintiffs in the case, confirmed Monday morning.
But that does not mean the overall lawsuit against the Trump administration is moot, said Kevin Love Hubbard, an attorney representing the plaintiffs for the Lawyers’ Committee for Rhode Island representing the plaintiffs .
Hubbard said the lawsuit targets the administration’s attempts to revoke waivers that existing SNAP recipients have from new work requirements mandated under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.
McConnell on Oct. 31 issued a temporary restarting order (TRO) demanding that all previous work requirement waivers must remain valid after their initial termination.
Waivers had allowed states and municipalities to show USDA evidence that certain areas had limited job opportunities, exempting people from work requirements necessary for food assistance. The lawsuit notes plaintiff cities of Providence, Central Falls, and Pawtucket each received waivers in March 2025 that were valid through Feb. 28, 2026.
“We’re in the posture where the existing TRO remains in place on the waivers question while the federal government figures out what they want to do,” Hubbard said. “The question is whether they’re going to continue to litigate and convince Judge McConnell not to issue more permanent relief on that front.”
The Trump administration chose not to tap into contingency funds to continue SNAP benefits during the shutdown. But after the coalition of communities and nonprofits filed suit in Rhode Island, McConnell gave the federal government two options: Cover partial benefits through a $5.5 billion contingency fund or other reserves, or pay for a full month tapping into additional revenue sources such as the Child Nutrition Program.
The USDA initially chose the latter option. But McConnell issued a clarifying order to fully fund the program, which the administration then appealed in Boston and before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Republican-led legislative package that reopened the federal government fully funds SNAP, and children’s nutrition programs, including subsidized school breakfast and lunch, and the availability of food during summer school breaks.
In addition to the three Rhode Island cities, the named plaintiffs include national groups and cities such as Baltimore; Columbus, Ohio; Durham, North Carolina; New Haven, Connecticut; and Albuquerque, New Mexico. The Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Center in Newport, East Bay Community Action Program, United Way Of Rhode Island, Federal Hill House Association and Amos House are also plaintiffs.

(Photo by Kate Brindley/New Hampshire Bulletin)Trump administration lawyers suing New Hampshire officials to gain access to the state’s voter file are now seeking to block a group of New Hampshire residents from entering that lawsuit. 
In a legal memo submitted Friday to the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire, attorneys for the U.S. Department of Justice said the residents do not meet the legal requirements to be added as intervenors. 
In September, the Justice Department brought a lawsuit against New Hampshire Secretary of State Dave Scanlan, seeking to compel Scanlan to hand over the state’s voter file so federal officials could check it for ineligible New Hampshire voters. Scanlan has refused to provide the file despite multiple requests this year, citing state law that prohibits most disclosure. The file contains the full name, date of birth, residential address, driver’s license number, and Social Security number for each registered voter. 
Days after that lawsuit, a bipartisan group of residents requested to the federal court to be added as intervenors, arguing the Trump administration’s actions would violate their privacy rights as voters, as well as the ability for some of them to recruit voters who may not want to be added to the list. The group, including former Republican state Rep. Neal Kurk, Portsmouth attorney Christopher Cole, former Democratic state Rep. Bob Perry, and liberal activist Louise Spencer, appealed to the federal court to be added as an intervenor. 
If granted, the intervenor request would give those residents a status similar to co-defendants and allow them to make their own arguments in favor of dismissal of the lawsuit.
“DOJ’s demands not only run roughshod over federalism principles and New Hampshire law — they spurn Proposed Intervenors’ privacy rights,” the residents’ September brief reads. 
There are two paths for residents to become intervenors: “intervention as of right,” in which a judge finds they meet strict statutory criteria under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, and “permissive intervention,” in which the judge finds they have an interest in a common legal question that might be answered by the lawsuit. 
The Justice Department lawyers argue the residents don’t meet either criteria. Their lawsuit against Scanlan argues the state is violating both the Help America Vote Act of 2002 and the Civil Rights Act of 1960 by not supplying the voter file. They argue those statutes give the U.S. Department of Justice the authority and responsibility to ensure state voter lists are accurate, a point Scanlan has disagreed with. 
And in their brief Friday, the Justice Department attorneys say because none of the residents represent state government, the statutes at the heart of the lawsuits do not apply to them. The residents are not responsible for maintaining accurate voter files, for instance.  
“Rather, they assert only that they are individuals that perform voter engagement, assisted with legislation, and education for some voters and seek to maintain the privacy of voters they claim to represent,” the federal brief reads.  “… While these may be noble interests, they fall well outside the clear language of the parties covered under the provisions of HAVA and the CRA that the Attorney General is enforcing in this action.” 
The lawyers also said the residents’ fears of potential abuse of voter data by the U.S. government are unfounded.
“The Proposed Intervenors’ alleged injury — fear that voter data may be misused or chill voter engagement from the community — is not concrete or imminent, but hypothetical and baseless,” the brief reads. “The information at issue is already subject to extensive statutory protections under Federal law.”
New Hampshire is one of 14 states the Trump administration is currently suing over refusals to provide voter registration information, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, a voting rights think tank. Two states, Indiana and Wyoming, have provided their full lists, and other states have turned over only the publicly available versions of the lists.

How the Warmth Support Program works
For nearly four decades, Vermont’s community-funded Warmth Support Program has filled critical gaps in heating assistance, especially during the early and late winter months when federal and state programs aren’t running. 
Warmth assistance is administered by Vermont’s five Community Action Agencies. For the Warmth Support Program, trained staff work directly with households who are running out of bulk fuel or at risk of electric or gas disconnection. The program is also accessible to those just above eligibility thresholds for federal programs, but still unable to afford essential heat.
To date, the program has delivered more than 95,000 emergency disbursements to Vermonters, with staff describing the impact bluntly: warmth literally saves people’s lives every year.
How your gift today does double duty
Donating to the Warmth Support Program is a concrete way that neighbors can help neighbors stay safe and warm through the winter.
Warmth Support funds go directly to fuel suppliers to prevent shutoffs and ensure households don’t run out of heat. No administrative fees are taken from contributions, a model designed to amplify the impact of every donation.
At the same time, Vermonters rely on VTDigger for clear, fact-based reporting on the issues shaping daily life, from energy and housing costs to legislative debates, climate resilience, school funding and local government decision-making. Reader support ensures this reporting remains accessible to all, without a paywall.
Right now, your donation supports trusted local news and provides warmth to a household in need.
Donate by Dec. 25 and your gift will have double the impact. It will fund independent journalism and thanks to our partnership sponsor, Vermont Gas, it will also provide one day of heat for a low-income Vermont home through the Warmth Support Program.

(Getty Images illustration)The New Mexico Department of Health on Monday said it continues to “strongly recommend” newborns receive hepatitis B vaccinations, including the first dose within the first 24 hours of birth.
The announcement follows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices’ vote on Friday to recommend delaying the initial dose for babies whose mothers test negative for hepatitis B.
According to a news release from the CDC, the committee instead recommended “individual-based decision-making” for parents whose children were born to women who tested negative for the virus. And for those infants not receiving a dose at birth, ACIP recommended administering the initial dose no earlier than two months of age.
In a news release, NMDOH noted that its recommendation aligns with the American Academy of Pediatrics and many other professional health organizations. Following ACIP’s vote, American Academy of Pediatrics President Dr. Susan J. Kressly released a statement calling the guidance “irresponsible and purposely misleading,” and said it would “lead to more hepatitis B infections in infants and children.”
A highly infectious virus, Hepatitis b “can survive on surfaces for up to seven days and often spreads without visible blood exposure,” the NMDOH news release said. Prior to the start of universal newborn vaccination in 1991, “thousands of children were infected annually,” and up to 90% of those infected at birth developed chronic hepatitis B and approximately 25% die prematurely from related liver disease.
The NMDOH news also said the three-dose vaccination series against hepatitis B “provides protection into adulthood and significantly decreases risk for hepatitis B-associated liver diseases, including cancer,” and will continue to be available through the federal Vaccines for Children program as well as Medicaid and private insurance.
“For decades, the hepatitis B vaccine has proven safe and effective at protecting children from infection, including in settings like day care and schools where others may not know they are infected,” NMDOH Chief Medical Officer Dr. Miranda Durham said in a statement. “The vaccine provides a safety net for newborns at a time when they are most susceptible to disease.

It will build or rehabilitate 160 housing units, a press release from the agency said. 
“As Montana’s economy continues to grow, it is crucial that our workers and their families have an affordable place to call home. The projects that were selected by the Board will provide more affordable housing options for families and seniors in Billings, Kalispell, Livingston, Miles City and Missoula,” said Commerce Director Marta Bertoglio.
Saddle Horn Apartments in Miles City will receive $8.5 million to build 28 new homes, while the Tower Apartments in Billings will get $7.5 million to rehabilitate 44 affordable homes for seniors.
Additionally, a Missoula project is expected to receive $7.5 million to rehabilitate 44 affordable homes for seniors at the Wildflower Apartments.
Outpost at Kalispell will receive $8,336,000 to build 24 new affordable homes for families and individuals. And in Livingston, the Sheep Mountain Residences will receive $6.7 million to build 24 new affordable homes for families and individuals.
The Montana Board of Housing, which is attached to the Department of Commerce, picks the projects — federal money flows through the agency and is divided among projects annually. 
Last year, the funds went to projects in Billings, Bozeman, Dillon, Missoula and Polson.
“Each year, the Board has to make very tough decisions on which projects will receive housing tax credits. All the projects that were presented to us are worthy of receiving housing credits; unfortunately, we cannot fund them all due to limited federal funding,” said MBOH Vice Chair Sheila Rice.

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas legislative leaders’ messaging has teetered between confident and uncertain as they approach a possible attempt at drawing new Congressional lines in January.
House Speaker Dan Hawkins, a Wichita Republican who is running for state insurance commissioner, said in an interview with a conservative political commentator that something isn’t connecting with a handful of holdouts in his caucus. 
Hawkins and Senate President Ty Masterson, also a Wichita Republican, spoke with pundit Hugh Hewitt at a recent conference in Fort Worth held by the American Legislative Exchange Council, a nonprofit that convenes state legislators and private industries while crafting model legislation.
Both discussed possible redistricting in Kansas’ upcoming legislative session and their bids for statewide office. Masterson is one of nine Republican candidates for governor.
Leadership failed to rally enough support to call a special session this fall to pass a redistricted map of Kansas’ congressional districts. The effort was part of a nationwide push to retain Republican seats in the upcoming midterm elections.
Masterson obtained enough votes in the Senate for a special session, but Hawkins fell about 10 votes short.
“Do your members understand that politics is now nationalized and that — I know they might not think that way in Kansas — but if the (U.S.) House is one seat D(emocratic), it’s because Kansas didn’t act. Do they get it?” Hewitt said during the nine-and-a-half minute interview posted to Hawkins’ YouTube Channel.
Hawkins said redistricting is possible, but something must change. He said the House Republicans who didn’t support the special session have different reasons for not favoring redistricting, and the national message isn’t connecting with everyone.
Masterson was more confident.
“We’ll have no trouble for sure passing a new map with majorities,” he told Hewitt in a separate interview.
The uncertainty lies in how Republicans can overcome Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly’s anticipated vetoes, he said.
Redistricting could also affect whether the state Republicans will retain their supermajorities, which has caused a bit of fear as they approach the 2026 election cycle, Masterson said.
But redistricting is a must for Masterson.
“I think we have to do it,” he said.
He said he is “not a fan of drawing deep red and deep blue districts,” instead favoring districts that “look like Kansas.”
“I think there should be a shot in all of them,” Masterson said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100057-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-08 15:59:13.303734

Bill Huizenga (R-Zeeland) campaigns in Lansing on Aug. 27, 2022. (Andrew Roth | Michigan Advance)The anti-Trump Save America Movement PAC, the spending arm of a nonprofit organization founded by former Republicans to combat policies of President Donald Trump, launched its “Save America Seats” midterm election spending campaign. 
The campaign will target districts held by GOP incumbents, as well as defending battleground districts currently held by Democrats. Among the first districts targeted in the campaign is Michigan’s 4th Congressional District, currently held by U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga (R-Holland Township). 
The initial spending push will focus on 11 congressional districts, but the group hopes to expand to over 50 U.S. House races, a press release from the organization said.
“SAM PAC is applying one standard to its evaluation of Congressional districts: any member, Democrat or Republican, who backs Trump’s economic agenda at the expense of their own constituents will face accountability,” the press release stated.
The spending in the campaign could reach $100 million, according to POLITICO. 
“For years, DC Democrats wrote off rural towns, farmers, ranchers, veterans, and small businesses while Trump’s policies gutted them,” Mary Corcoran, a co-founder of the Save America Movement PAC said in the press release. “We’re not writing them off. We’re speaking to them in their media, in their language, on their terms. These races don’t become competitive by magic. They become competitive when you hit early and never let up.”

Steve Schmidt, another co-founder of the PAC, called out a “deep crisis of competence” within the Democratic national establishment, noting that this campaign intends to focus on areas of the country that the party tends to invest less in. 
The campaign will include rural radio, agricultural-network buys, billboards and targeted digital programs, and will focus on directly tying incumbent Republican members of Congress to Trump’s policies, including health care costs and rural hospital closures. 
Michigan’s 4th Congressional District is a target district for Democrats to flip in 2026 — especially as Huizenga had left questions open as to whether or not he would run for re-election after deciding in July not to run for U.S. Senate.
A recent poll by Public Policy Polling showed state Sen. Sean McCann (D-Kalamazoo) within the margin of error behind Huizenga, only trailing by two points. 
McCann — who was recently endorsed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer — faces Kalamazoo attorney Jessica Swartz, IT and cybersecurity professional Richard Aaron and former Congressional staffer Diop Harris in the Democratic primary.

(Photo by Jay Waagmeester/Florida Phoenix)Florida Senate President Ben Albritton said Monday that he would prefer to wait to decide about a mid-decade congressional redistricting until after the U.S. Supreme Court rules in a Voting Rights Act case sometime next year.
That would contradict the timetable for congressional redistricting set last week by a select committee in the Florida House and put the upper chamber in synch with Gov. Ron DeSantis, who said last week that he wants the Legislature to act during a special legislative session sometime after the regular session ends next year on March 13.
“What the governor has suggested is that we wait until the spring to redistrict,” Albritton said in a sit-down meeting with reporters who cover the Capitol. “He has his various reasons why we wait until the spring. I don’t have any issue with that. If you’ve seen anything out of the Senate, we move pretty slowly, anyhow. But our goal is just to be methodical and measured.”
DeSantis has said for months that he wants Florida to join a growing list of both red and blue states that have engaged in unprecedented mid-decade congressional redistricting ever since President Donald Trump called on Texas legislators to do so to help Republicans maintain their majority in the U.S. House of Representatives.
Democrats and voting rights advocates say Florida would be in violation of the Fair District Amendments passed by state voters in 2010 that insist no reapportionment plan or individual district can be drawn “with the intent to favor or disfavor a political party or incumbent.”
DeSantis has denied that is what would be taking place, saying last week that lawmakers are “not allowed to use partisan data” and that they would be “forced to” redistrict its 28 congressional seats once the Supreme Court rules on the case involving Louisiana’s congressional map.
House Speaker Daniel Perez announced in August that the House would convene the select committee to create a new congressional map in time for the 2026 elections. (That committee held its first meeting last week).
However, Albritton had not commented at all about where his chamber stood until last week, when he released a statement acknowledging the governor’s “desire” to redistrict the state’s congressional seats but that there was “no ongoing work” to that end in the Senate.
Disagreement with the House on timing
Albritton doubled down Monday, saying the Senate is not drawing any proposed maps right now and that he doesn’t see any need to do so until after the legal picture becomes clearer.
During arguments in the Louisiana case in October, justices seemed amenable to limiting the consideration of race in the redistricting process, a move that would undermine a key portion of the 1965 U.S. Voting Rights Act.
By agreeing with DeSantis, Albritton puts Senate at odds with the House on timing. The chairman of the House congressional redistricting committee said last week that it would be “irresponsible” to delay, specifically because the deadline for candidates to qualify for federal races next year is April 20.
Albritton bristled at the notion Monday that his chamber isn’t acting independently, just because it agrees with DeSantis and not the House on timing.
Proclaiming the Senate ‘an independent body’
“The Florida Senate has a very special role in all of this,” he said. “And that role is we are an independent body the same way the Florida House is and the same way that the executive office of the governor is. The same way that the courts are. If we happen to agree with the governor on something, it doesn’t mean anything other than, ‘Well, we happen to agree.’
“If we disagree with the governor on something, no, I’m not going to make a spectacle of it. But the fact is that we do on things disagree. And that’s the way the system’s supposed to work. So, I just push back on the notion that just because, you know, we happen to agree with waiting on redistricting because it makes sense to me in my mind to wait and garner all the information we can on it, sure.”
Asked what he would do if the House passes a congressional map during the regular session and then sends it to the Senate, Albritton was noncommittal.
“We’ll see what happens,” he said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_7898-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 15:59:13.303734

The bill was passed by the House on Dec. 1 and referred to a Senate committee the next day. The federal government shutdown in October forced a pause in the Medicare program, and it would face another pause next month if budget negotiations break down again.  
Shutdown forces Medicare patients off popular telehealth and hospital-at-home programs

As of last fall, 366 hospitals nationwide had participated in the hospital-at-home program, serving 31,000 patients, according to a federal report. The program, officially called Acute Hospital Care at Home, allows patients who would otherwise be hospitalized to receive care at home with a combination of nurse visits, monitoring equipment and remote doctor visits.
“The hospital-at-home model gives hospitals the flexibility to treat certain patients in the comfort and convenience of their own homes rather than in the hospital,” said Pennsylvania Republican U.S. Rep. Lloyd Smucker, speaking on the House floor during debate on the bill Dec. 1. 
“A number of hospitals in my district have used the program to great effect,” he said. “One hospital system has accepted more than 800 patients, freeing up more than 1,500 hospital bed-days and saving approximately $1.1 million.”
The bill still must be passed by the Senate and signed by President Donald Trump before taking effect. Another popular Medicare program, which offers telehealth visits, was also paused in the shutdown and would still be subject to a pause if the short-term funding bill passed in November ends Jan. 30 without a new budget agreement.

A new report from the state Legislative Finance Committee predicts less than 1% of growth for next year’s state budget. (Anna Padilla for Source NM)New Mexico’s economy is “treading water,” but not at risk of a recession, according to state economists. They expect the state budget to grow by a slim margin in the next fiscal year due to some revenue sources generating less than previously projected.
Economists and cabinet secretaries on Monday presented lawmakers on the state’s Legislative Finance Committee with two reports about New Mexico’s general fund revenue for the upcoming fiscal year. Projections for “total new money,” the amount by which the state budget can grow, are estimated at $105.7 million, which is less than 1% growth from the current fiscal year. The state’s recurring revenue for this fiscal year — which comes from sources such as corporate and personal income taxes — initially was projected at $13.7 billion as part of an August forecast. That number has decreased by nearly $323 million.
Officials impressed upon lawmakers that while the numbers are concerning, they don’t see a need for drastic measures like budget cuts. The state’s budget continues growing, just at a slower pace than recent years, they said.
New Mexico is “still in a pretty good place,” state Department of Finance and Administration Secretary Wayne Propst told lawmakers Monday. “Even in a worst-case scenario…we are still not needing to look at reductions.”
Analysts primarily attribute the economic slowdown to a reduction in the state’s collection of corporate income taxes, an effect of the “One Big Beautiful Bill.” The federal legislation gave tax relief to industries including oil and gas and manufacturing, which together make up half of New Mexico’s corporate tax base, according to one of Monday’s reports. Corporate income tax revenue was in the red in this fiscal year’s first quarter — the first time that’s happened since the “short-lived pandemic oil crash of 2020,” the report said.
With less than 1% of growth for new money, any budget lawmakers pass in the upcoming legislative session starting in January, 2026 will likely have little room for risk, analysts said. Executive orders from the governor’s office could wipe out all new money, one report said. The governor’s use of executive orders to pay for the state’s response to unexpected disasters such as the COVID-19 pandemic, wildfires and flooding has become a point of contention between Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham and some lawmakers.
“The takeaway from my presentation is one of concern,” Ismael Torres, LFC’s chief economist, told lawmakers Monday morning. “There is still a path forward here. We’re still expecting to miss a recession.”
Torres’ report highlighted a number of other recent federal policy changes that are impacting the state’s revenues, including:

Increased standard deduction: estimated loss of $39.2 million in fiscal year 2027, which begins in July
No tax on car loan interest: estimated loss of $6.4 million in fiscal year 2027
Limitation on individual deductions for certain state and local taxes: estimated loss of $66.7 million in fiscal year 2027
All other changes to business-related federal taxes: estimated loss of $144.7 million in fiscal year 2027
Changes to Medicaid and state-directed payments: estimated loss of $17.1 million in fiscal year 2027

Some lawmakers on Monday used the reports as evidence that New Mexico needs to diversify its economy.
“We are so reliant on oil and gas and the feds,” said Sen. George Muñoz (D-Gallup), who serves as chair of the Senate Finance Committee. “Let’s ride this out and let’s roll up our sleeves…and figure out how not to hit that recession.”
Economic growth largely depends on consumer spending by families in the nation’s top 10% of income and on publicly traded stocks in artificial intelligence companies. In the last decade, presenters said, national construction on data centers has skyrocketed from less than $5 billion in 2015 to more than $40 billion this year. 
That national economic outlook resembles “a story familiar to New Mexico, one that’s very reliant on one industry,” Torres, the LFC’s chief economist, said. “It’s a narrow tightrope walk. If AI revenue doesn’t materialize to the extent it’s expected…those stocks could fall, high-income earners could become discouraged and stop spending and then the economy could take a turn for the worse.”
State funds in investment accounts continue to earn interest, Torres said, and are projected to remain the most stable revenue sources for the state’s budget.
But the “saving grace” of this year, he said, is the New Mexico State Land Office, which has leased and sold more than $476 million of land. If it weren’t for that revenue, “we would’ve been in the red and it would’ve been a much tougher financial picture,” Torres said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/IMG_0528-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 15:59:13.303734

Habba, though, won’t walk away unemployed. She said she will serve as senior adviser to Attorney General Pamela Bondi on U.S. attorney matters.
“As a result of the Third Circuit’s ruling, and to protect the stability and integrity of the office which I love, I have decided to step down from my role as the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey,” Habba said in a statement. “But do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me.”
She also left the door open to returning, saying she’s awaiting further review of the court’s ruling.
Trump named Habba U.S. attorney for New Jersey in March. But after the Senate did not approve her nomination within the timeframe required by law, Trump administration officials resorted to a string of maneuvers to keep her in the job — even firing her top deputy, Desiree Leigh Grace. Federal judges had appointed Grace in July, a task federal law allows them to do if the Senate fails to act.
Several criminal defendants then challenged Habba’s continued service in the post, prompting the legal battle that led to the 3rd Circuit’s decision Dec. 1. In that ruling, a three-judge panel found that the Trump administration’s moves undercut constitutional protections meant to ensure the three branches of government remain separate but equal.
Habba in her Monday statement complained about the “lawfare aimed at President Trump” since his first term and called his critics “obstructionists.”
“Do not mistake compliance for surrender. This decision will not weaken the Justice Department and it will not weaken me,” she wrote. “My fight will now stretch across the country.”
She blasted the U.S. senators, Democrats Cory Booker and Andy Kim, who fought her confirmation, and the federal judges who suspended most prosecutions and some other court operations until the challenge to Habba’s authority was resolved.
The U.S. Senate’s “blue slip” process allows home-state senators to block some of the president’s nominees from moving forward.
“While I was focused on delivering real results, judges in my state took advantage of a flawed blue slip tradition and became weapons for the politicized left,” Habba wrote. “For months, these judges stopped conducting trials and entering sentences, leaving violent criminals on the streets. They joined New Jersey senators, who care more about fighting President Trump than the well being of residents which they serve.”

(Photo by Casey Smith/Indiana Capital Chronicle)The Indiana Senate’s Republican leader wasn’t making predictions Monday about the fate of the congressional redistricting proposal that’s become a test of loyalty to President Donald Trump.
Hundreds of anti-redistricting protesters filled the corridor outside the Senate chamber as it began taking up the bill that Republicans pushed through the House last week.
GOP Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has warned for months that not enough senators supported redrawing the maps for the issue to win approval.
When asked Monday whether he believe there were enough votes for redistricting now, Bray avoided a direct answer.
“I’ve said before that they weren’t there,” Bray told reporters. “People are having a conversation about it. Senators know there’s going to be a chance to vote on it, so we’ll see Thursday.”

The Senate Elections Committee was holding a public hearing Monday afternoon on the bill, with the committee chair saying 127 people had signed up to testify. Sen. Mike Gaskill – chair of the committee – kept testifiers to a strict, two-minute timer at the front of the chamber that ticked down 120 seconds each time someone came to the microphone to speak.
He also warned against using signs or applauding, even telling police to remove people who clap.
A committee vote was expected late Monday afternoon.
Senators are expected to meet again on Wednesday to consider possible amendments to the proposal in House Bill 1032, with a full Senate vote expected Thursday.
While the Senate held a brief floor session Monday anti-redistricting protestors can be heard from outside the chamber, chanting, “No cheaters!” over and over again, and “No redistricting!” 
Many were holding signs with sayings like, “Protect our vote!” and “Democracy doesn’t get redrawn.”
The redrawn congressional map targets Indiana’s current two Democratic U.S. House members and is designed to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm election.
Initial testimony was split on the issue — a marked difference from last week’s Indiana House hearing where 43 were against and only two in support
Mike Morris, with Lafayette Citizens in Action, told the committee “it’s time for Republicans to take a page from (Democrats’) playbook.”
He noted that U.S. Reps. André Carson and Frank Mrvan — Indiana’s two Democratic members of Congress — have supported tax hikes and twice voted to impeach President Trump.
“Senators, I urge you not to just merely be in office, but to be in power, and to use that power to save our federal republic,” he said.
John Colburn, of Sellersburg, additionally called on senators “to help fight the actions of California, Illinois, New York and others.”
As Indiana Senate begins redistricting turn, some Republicans keep mum

“If, by your inaction, a Democratic majority enters the House of Representatives in January, the result will be the beginning of two years of more accusations and investigations based upon the lies and deceit,” he said.
But Kelly Thompson, a Democratic congressional candidate in northern Indiana’s 3rd District, said she was “appalled” that the House had advanced the redistricting measure and that lawmakers “have forgotten who it is that they have been hired by, and who they are obligated to represent.”
“Instead of fighting for Hoosiers — the majority of which are against mid-cycle redistricting maps for Congress — they have chosen to cave to the pressure of the very people they have pledged to protect us from, the D.C elite,” she said.
Hoosier military veteran Lasima Packett, also opposed, called the bill “purely for political performance.”
“Today, the Senate has the opportunity to not just vote on the bill, but to lead the nation to show that in our state, we do not cave to the pressures from Washington, D.C.,” she said. “We do not redraw the democracy to suit a moment. And here, in this state, we still believe in fairness, transparency and the right for every Hoosier to be fully represented.”
The House approved the redistricting bill Friday, as expected, on a vote of 57-41. Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats present in opposition.
Indiana’s Constitution requires a majority of the 50-member Senate to approve legislation. That means the 40-member Republican supermajority must muster at least 26 votes to pass the bill if all 10 Democrats oppose. GOP Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith can break a 25-25 tie but only if there are no absences.
Sixteen Senate Republicans have publicly come out in favor of a redraw — some more enthusiastically than others — and 14 are against. The remaining 10 Republican senators haven’t taken a public stance.
Gov. Mike Braun has stood by threats that he and Trump have made to support Republican primary challengers against recalcitrant senators — and to keep up the pressure campaign if the Senate were to reject the new maps next week.

(Getty Images)A state judge has given Yazzie/Martinez plaintiffs extra time to file objections to a court-ordered Public Education Department plan to better serve public school students.
The plaintiffs in the long-running education equity lawsuit had until Dec. 1 to respond to the plan, delivered by PED about a month ago. But they argued in a motion filed last week they needed more time to finish reviewing it with experts and then draft their objections. PED Secretary Mariana Padilla told lawmakers two weeks ago the plan has “changed drastically” from an earlier draft.
Based on the plaintiffs’ ongoing review, the plan is “thoroughly inadequate” and violates previous court orders, the motion reads, and they intend to file “substantial” objections.

This story originally published on New Mexico In Depth.

The plaintiffs requested a Jan. 30 deadline. PED asked that it instead be pushed to Feb. 19 — the last day of the legislative session — which State District Court Judge Matthew Wilson granted. The department will have 30 days after that to respond, then the plaintiffs will have another 30 days to reply.
New Mexico legislators express concerns about judiciary’s role in education policymaking 

This spring, Wilson agreed with the plaintiffs that PED hadn’t complied with a 2018 court ruling that found New Mexico had violated its constitutional duty to provide a sufficient education to all children, particularly Native American and low-income students, English language learners and students with disabilities.
Wilson ordered PED to craft a comprehensive remedial action plan.
After public meetings and a statewide survey, the department delivered a 70-page draft in October. Indigenous education experts said it had major gaps, including limited concrete goals and funding estimates.
PED’s final version, submitted in early November, more than doubled, to 190 pages. According to a department press release, it adds “clearer outcomes and accountability measures,” among other improvements.
But advocates, educators and the plaintiffs say the revised plan is still short on details and wouldn’t adequately overhaul the public education system.
“We are deeply, deeply disappointed with this document,” Alisa Diehl, a member of the Yazzie legal team, said during a community event in Bernalillo last month. “We are at a critical crossroads … where the state has been given ample opportunity to do what it needs to do.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/studentsinclassroom-1024x686.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038

(Reader submitted photo)  State documents show a contractor has recovered dozens of oil-covered and injured animals after the Smitty’s Supply Inc. environmental disaster in Tangipahoa Parish. Several others were found dead on site or later died from their injuries. 
The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality released a report Thursday showing the most recent count for the wildlife known to have been impacted by the Aug. 22 fire, explosion and massive chemical and petroleum products spill. 
Lindsey Reeves, a spokeswoman for the Center for Biological Diversity, called the report “deeply troubling” though said she’s not surprised at the impact on wildlife given the massive volume of the oil spill, which polluted the surrounding environment with an estimated 12 million gallons of oily and liquid chemical waste.
The report, dated Dec. 3, details a state contractor’s work recovering 74 live wild animals, including 59 listed as “oiled” and 15 others — mostly opossums and raccoons — that were captured and relocated to unaffected areas. A total of eight animals were listed as dead.

The contractor, Wildlife Response Services LLC, sent a team of five workers to Tangipahoa Parish on Oct. 11 with a few off-road vehicles and a trailer outfitted with equipment to scrub down oiled wildlife. The WRS team established a temporary rehabilitation center where animals have been bathed, fed and monitored until they’re well enough to be released back into the wild. Some have been sent to veterinary clinics for more advanced treatment. The location of the rehab center hasn’t been disclosed.  
The company reported 29 animals have been rehabilitated and released as of Dec. 3. Separate records from the Department of Environmental Quality note some animals were released at the Joyce Wildlife Management Area, a state-owned swamp just north of Pass Manchac.
Most of the oiled animals recovered have been reptiles, including 50 turtles and three alligators. Also listed as oiled were four birds and two amphiumas, which are large, aquatic salamanders often mistaken for eels or snakes. 
Among the birds were large species that typically nest near water: a Canada goose, a great egret, an osprey and a pied-billed grebe. The grebe later died, but the goose and egret recovered and were released. The report doesn’t mention the status of the osprey.
One bobcat is listed in the report, though it doesn’t specify whether it was injured or just relocated. A separate LDEQ document noted it as a bobcat kitten but offered no more details.   
Four eastern river cooter turtles also died after being secured. Two of the turtles died while in care, and the other two were euthanized at LSU Small Animal Hospital in Baton Rouge, according to the report. 
The WRS team also found an alligator, a mouse and a raccoon already dead in the area impacted by the Smitty’s Supply disaster. The report indicates the contractors collected and disposed of the carcasses.

When reached by phone Friday, Wildlife Response Services owner Rhonda Murgatroyd said she wasn’t allowed to discuss her work without permission from the Department of Environmental Quality or the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. When asked about that policy Friday afternoon, LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said she would look into the matter. 
Reeves, with the Center for Biological Diversity, said there are likely many more affected animals the company wasn’t able to find. 
“After the spill, the Tangipahoa River looked like motor oil, so I suspect that the impacts to wildlife, especially aquatic species, are probably more significant and will be longer term than we see in this report,” Reeves said.
While reptiles, birds and mammals have been found injured or dead, no fish kills in the Tangipahoa River have been reported in connection with the disaster, LDEQ spokesman Greg Langley said. Much of the river, which runs directly adjacent to the Smitty’s Supply plant, was closed to the public for over two months. 
Animals of particular concern in the contractor’s report include the alligator snapping turtles, a threatened species that has been proposed for listing under the Endangered Species Act, Reeves said. The team recovered 12 alligator snapping turtles, one of which required more advanced veterinary care from LSU Small Animal Hospital, according to the report.
Other imperiled species that live within the footprint of the spill but haven’t been reported as affected by the disaster are manatees and freshwater mussels, Reeves said. 
“One of the things that’s been keeping me up at night is there are manatees in the Tangipahoa River,” she said. “There’s actually a lot of protected species that live in the Tangipahoa. It’s really a special place.”
Wild animals have borne the brunt of the oil spill, but pets and livestock have also been impacted, according to several Tangipahoa residents. 
A cattle farmer, Ronnie Polezcek, who lives 3 miles from Smitty’s Supply said fallout from the disaster contaminated hay he planned to feed his herd. He also reported the delivery of a stillborn calf immediately after the explosion, according to his lawsuit against the company.
Candy Cardwell, who lives near the Smitty’s Supply facility and saw her house covered in soot and oily residue during the fire, said in an email Friday that her dog, Rusty, is still suffering from bouts of illness since the fire. A veterinarian couldn’t give her a definitive diagnosis or attribute the symptoms to certain environmental toxins, she added. 
“At one point, I thought I was going to lose him,” Cardwell said. 
Cardwell said she’s not surprised by the amount of wildlife injured in the disaster because the animals that once frequented her garden have mostly disappeared. 
“I can tell you, I don’t have frogs, lizards or rabbits anymore,” she said. “I’ve only seen one squirrel. Things like that for a good ecosystem are gone.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (This image cannot be republished without a Getty subscription.)OKLAHOMA CITY — The Attorney General’s Office settled a lawsuit with CVS Caremark over allegations the company was under reimbursing Oklahoma pharmacies.
While CVS Caremark did not admit to wrongdoing, the company will pay over $5 million to Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office and agreed to certain reforms to avoid further litigation, according to the settlement first publicized Monday. 
Reforms include reviewing pharmacy payment disputes against national cost benchmarks, responding to disputes within 10 days and working with the Attorney General’s Office to resolve additional complaints, according to a news release. 
CVS Caremark is a pharmacy benefit manager, or PBM, that works to negotiate prices between insurance companies, drug manufacturers and pharmacies. CVS Caremark operates under the parent company CVS Health.
“CVS Caremark cooperated fully to reach this settlement,” said Phillip Blando, a spokesperson for CVS Caremark, in a statement. “We are pleased to continue serving Oklahoma clients and their members to make prescription drugs more affordable.” 
Drummond’s office said 75% of settlement will repay Oklahoma pharmacies for more than 68,000 under reimbursed prescriptions filled between January 2024 and August 2025, according to a news release. The Attorney General’s Office will notify eligible pharmacies.
“When your local pharmacy is paid pennies on the dollar, or even loses money filling your prescription, it can’t keep its doors open,” Drummond said in a statement. “This settlement puts millions of dollars back into Oklahoma pharmacies so they can continue serving their communities. We’re protecting your access to the prescriptions you need and the pharmacists you trust, especially in small towns where the local pharmacy is often the only option for health care.” 
The last quarter of the settlement will support the Attorney General Office’s “continued oversight of PBMs.”
The settlement also covered the state’s investigation costs. 
Drummond filed the lawsuit in January and had sought the censure, suspension or revocation of CVS Caremark’s licenses and an assessment of fines.

The State of Iowa is contesting an injunction issued in a lawsuit brought by the former operator of the state-owned Honey Creek Resort in southern Iowa.
The lawsuit, filed last month in Polk County District Court by Achieva Enterprises, alleges state officials have misled the public into believing the company acted negligently and withdrew from the financially troubled Honey Creek Resort.
Achieva, which was hired by the state several years ago to operate and revitalize the resort at Rathbun Lake, is suing the Iowa Department of Administrative Services and Iowa Department of Natural Resources for the “abrupt and unlawful termination” of its concessionaire agreement with the state.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
According to the lawsuit, DAS terminated its contract with Achieva without notice and in direct violation of the contract’s terms. “DAS then took extreme and disruptive actions, including shutting down the resort, firing over 50 employees, evicting guests, confiscating personal property, and making public statements that damaged Achieva’s reputation and business relationships,” Achieva alleges in its lawsuit.
The DNR, as the legal owner of Honey Creek Resort, “actively participated in the termination and transition process,” the lawsuit claims, adding that the two state agencies’ actions have “caused irreparable damage to Achieva’s business, reputation, and property interests” and now “threatens the continued viability of Honey Creek Resort as a public asset.”
Last month, a judge approved portions of Achieva’s request for an “interim temporary injunction” in the case, pending a hearing on the matter. The injunction temporarily bars the state from either reopening the Honey Creek Resort to the public or hiring a new third-party operator to manage the resort while the lawsuit moves forward in court.
The Iowa attorney general’s office has declined to comment on Achieva’s allegations, but has filed a brief with the court arguing an injunction will unduly burden operations at the resort and be against the public interest.
The state says it terminated the contract with Achieva because the company failed to live up its contractual obligations “for significant lengths of time.”
In its brief to the court, the state also notes that the contract specifically allowed DAS to immediately terminate the two parties’ relationship, without any advance notice to Achieva, in the event that the company ended or suspended its business.  According to the state, Achieva’s president, Beth Henderson, “directly indicated to DAS that (the company) would do exactly that on October 21, 2025.”
In addition, the state claims, Achieva failed to comply with the contract’s requirements to obtain and maintain insurance, exposing the state to increased liability, and also failed to provide periodic reports of its financial and operational activities.
The state further alleges that an injunction forcing the state to further pause its efforts to hire a new resort operator will result in further damage to “the resort’s operations and viability as an ongoing venue for Iowans to enjoy the state’s natural beauty.”
A court hearing on the temporary-injunction issue was held Nov. 24, 2025, but the two parties did not have time to present their closing arguments before the hearing concluded. A second hearing for that purpose is scheduled for Dec. 17, 2025.
Achieva alleges a ‘smear’ campaign by the state
The $60 million Honey Creek Resort opened to the public in 2008, offering a 106-room lodge, 28 cabins, an indoor waterpark, an 18-hole golf course and a marina. The resort struggled financially, and in 2013, the Iowa Legislature authorized a $33 million bailout to pay off the resort’s outstanding bonds.
In 2016, the DNR entered into a management contract with Delaware North Companies, a private hospitality firm. Under that agreement, Delaware North was to pay the state a portion of profits generated by the resort once annual revenue exceeded $7 million.
Over the next five years, annual revenues never reached the $7 million threshold, and in early 2022, Delaware North exercised an option to terminate its contract with the state. Achieva was then hired by the state to run Honey Creek. In its lawsuit, the company claims it “inherited a resort in disrepair — physically, financially, and reputationally.”
According to the lawsuit, the resort generated significant sales tax revenue for Iowa but operated on “razor-thin” profit margins. In late 2024, Achieva and DAS entered into a contractual amendment to provide the company with some temporary financial relief as the company worked to improve its operating margins.
That amendment temporarily waived Achieva’s obligation to deposit 5% of its gross monthly receipts into a state-created fund, enabling Achieva to use that money for operating expenses such as audits and insurance premiums.
In April 2025, following DAS’ failed attempt to give the resort to Appanoose County, DAS “abruptly ceased communication with Achieva,” the lawsuit alleges.
On Oct. 29, 2025, without warning, DAS sent a contract-termination letter to Achieva and then “took extreme and punitive actions” — shutting down the resort, barricading its entrances, and sending home “over 50 employees without notice, destroying livelihoods,” all while falsely claiming Achieva had abandoned the property, the lawsuit alleges.
The lawsuit claims that DAS then launched “a coordinated publicity and outreach campaign to smear Achieva,” issuing press releases and social media posts falsely portraying “Achieva as negligent and unfit” to run the resort.
The lawsuit alleges breach of contract and seeks a judgment declaring that various items Achieva purchased with its own funds — buildings, equipment, vehicles, and taxidermy — should remain with Achieva.

John James (R-Shelby Twp.) at a campaign event for JD Vance in Shelby Twp. on Aug. 7, 2024. | Lucy ValeskiSeveral key Republicans and other Michigan politicos have for months speculated if U.S. Rep. John James of Shelby Township was serious about his bid for governor in 2026, but a new campaign announcement shows he’s staffing up and getting ready for a strong primary fight in the upcoming August nomination contest.
James on Monday announced a reorganization of his campaign team, which now features a stalwart Michigan GOP operative in Tori Sachs, filling the role of senior advisor, as well as other national Republican faces.
The candidate, who is pushing his chips toward a gubernatorial bid instead of seeking reelection to Congress against the better wishes of the party and President Donald Trump, said the moves put him in a better position to win the August 2026 primary and the general election, should he become the nominee.
Trump jokes that GOP won’t let James seek Michigan governorship without a good replacement

“I’m excited to have assembled such a talented team who all share the same grit, passion for service, and love for our state and country as I do,” James said in a news release. “Their valuable experience of winning tough races in Michigan and nationally will help propel our winning message of bringing prosperity and sanity back to Michigan.”
Among the moves that will get the most attention in Lansing is the elevation of Sachs to the role of senior advisor.
Sachs is the current vice president of P2 Public Affairs and has worked over the past two decades as a Republican operative, issues advocacy and communications professional – with government and campaign experience to boot. She also served as the executive director for the Michigan Freedom Fund, managed James’ failed U.S. Senate campaign against outgoing U.S. Sen. Gary Peters (D-Bloomfield), and had a hand in other successful campaigns for governor.
Prior to the announcement, Sachs had been positioned as a strong supporter of James and was reportedly already doing work for James’ campaign.
Sachs made no formal announcement of the move on X but her feed is rife with James campaign related content.
James also announced that his longtime communications official, Hannah Osantowske, was moving from his congressional office to serve as his full-time campaign communications director. Osantowske served on his 2024 congressional reelection campaign. She was previously the press secretary for the Michigan Republican Party.
Other major moves affected the following James staffers:

Jackson Gross joined the campaign as its manager after previously serving as James’ congressional chief of staff;
Chris Grant will serve as an advisor. Grant is the founder of Big Dog Strategies, a national Republican firm that The New Yorker noted was behind the rise of George Santos.
Greg Brock will serve as his campaign policy advisor. He was previously a senior advisor, executive director and CEO of American Federation for Children, as well as the executive director of the Great Lakes Education Project, and the Michigan Republican Party.
Charlie Spies will serve as the campaign’s legal counsel. He currently leads the political law practice at the Dickinson Wright firm and has been involved in various GOP legal battles over the past decade.
Curt Anderson, a veteran of the Reagan White House and the National Republican Committee, will serve as James’ media advisor.

You wouldn’t want to argue with John L.,Rick Cleveland,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/08/mississippis-biggest-sports-event-ever/,"We could argue for days which is bigger: an NCAA championships playoff football game, the biggest women’s golf tournament in the world or the last bare-knuckles championship fight.","The longest bare-knuckle prizefight in history took place between John L. Sullivan and Jake Kilrain in an obscure location in south Mississippi.

Ole Miss will play host to Tulane in a first round college football playoffs game on Dec. 20 and some pundits already proclaim it the biggest, most important sports event to ever take place on Mississippi soil.
It’s huge, no doubt, and millions around the globe will watch on TV. The stakes are enormous. Win that one – and Ole Miss is a heavy favorite to do just that – and the Rebels then will play Georgia in the second round, which this year is the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Eve. Ole Miss would not be favored in that one, but the Rebels led Georgia midway through the fourth quarter on Oct. 18 at Athens. An upset could happen. Win that one and Ole Miss will be two victories away from a national championship – the proverbial pot at the end of the rainbow.
Rick Cleveland
But we are getting far, far ahead of ourselves. Let’s get back to the original case in point: Will the Tulane-Ole Miss playoff game indeed be the biggest, most important sporting event in Mississippi history?
That’s a good question. We don’t have any real bowl games in the Magnolia State. The Egg Bowl, which got its unofficial name for just that reason, is pretty much our biggest sports event of the year, every year. We don’t have much in the way of professional sports. The NCAA never holds any of its championships in Mississippi.
Twenty-six years ago, the late, great George Bryan brought golf’s U.S. Women’s Open – the most important tournament in women’s golf – to West Point. I still can’t believe Bryan pulled it off, but he did. Hall of Famer Juli Inkster won it and more than 120,000 fans attended. Millions more around the world watched on TV. 
That was huge – probably the most important sports event of the past century in Mississippi.
But there was one bigger still, although there is nobody alive who would remember it. John L. Sullivan, were he alive, would surely argue that the biggest sports event in Mississippi history took place on July 8, 1889. Trust me, you would not want to argue with John L.
On a brutally hot summer day in Richburg, a tiny community just south of Hattiesburg, Sullivan fought Jake Kilrain for the world heavyweight boxing championship. Adding to its historical importance, the fight was the last world championship bare-knuckle fight. Sullivan – the son of Irish immigrants famously known as “The Boston Strongboy” – punished Kilrain, a New Yorker, for 75 rounds before knocking him out.
The fight was the lead story in the next day’s New York Times. The story began: “Never, during even a Presidential election, has there been so much excitement as there is now, even when the brutal exhibition is over and it is known that John L. Sullivan was successful and that 75 rounds were necessary to knock out Jake Kilrain.”
Clearly, this is some serious Mississippi history here, and here’s the deal: The fight was not supposed to take place in Mississippi. No, bare-knuckle fighting had been outlawed in all 38 states at the time. The fight was supposed to have taken place in New Orleans, but Louisiana’s governor threatened to call in the state militia to prevent the fight from taking place. Enter one C.W. Rich, a wealthy lumberman and namesake of Richburg, who owned 30,000 acres and a large sawmill. Rich invited the entire fight party to his land, and they came by the thousands on trains.
Historical marker honoring where John L. Sullivan defeated Jake Kilrain for the heavyweight boxing championship.
We could argue for days which is bigger: an NCAA championships playoff football game, the biggest women’s golf tournament in the world or the last bare-knuckles championship fight. Better to call it a draw, which is what Kilrain offered to do after 44 rounds when Sullivan, who was knocking back whiskey between rounds, began vomiting. Sullivan declined the offer and promptly knocked Kilrain down with a blow to the ribs to end the 45th round.
So let’s not argue. Better to relive as best we can what happened more than 136 years ago in an otherwise sleepy south Mississippi community. Some snippets:

Mississippi Gov. Robert Lowry dispatched 25 armed men to the state line to stop the trains from crossing the state line. The trains plowed through, and no shots were fired. The county sheriff also tried to stop the fight at the site. But Bat Masterson, the legendary western gunfighter, gambler and sometimes lawman, not only refereed the fight but brandished his own firearms to dissuade the local lawman.
Bleachers, hastily constructed from Rich’s freshly cut pine, provided the seating for more than 3,000 spectators. The heat, which reportedly reached 106 degrees, caused resin to seep from the pine and more than a few spectators reportedly lost the backsides of their clothing to the sap. It was so hot that spectators paid the then-exorbitant cost of 25 cents for a ladle of water.
The fight was a perfect illustration of why bare-knuckle fighting had been banned. By the 34th round, both fighters were drenched in blood and sweat. Kilrain’s nose was broken, his lips split, and one eye was swollen shut. Sullivan’s fists suffered the consequences and reportedly were swollen to twice their normal size. He had a black eye and bled from one of his ears.
During the 75th round, a doctor told Kilrain’s cornermen their fighter would likely die if the fight continued. When Kilrain stumbled out to the center of the ring for the 76th round, they threw in the bloody sponge, signaling the end to the last world championship bare-knuckle fight. Sullivan was carried away on the shoulders of his adoring fans, while Kilrain reportedly wept like a child. Both were later arrested, but penalties were minimal.

We shall see what fate awaits the Tulane Green Wave and the Ole Miss Rebels on Dec. 20. There are likely to be some tears, but hopefully no arrests.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/08122009/SullIvan-Kilrain.jpg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038

Josh Stein speaks to reporters in Raleigh on Oct. 20, 2025. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)Gov. Josh Stein on Friday renewed his push for FEMA to approve North Carolina’s applications for a property buyout program – applications that have been pending for almost a year.
In a letter to FEMA’s new acting administrator Karen Evans, Stein requested that the agency fast-track additional aid to households, local governments and nonprofits in the mountains that continue to wait on crucial payments.
That includes the Hazard Grant Mitigation Program, a FEMA initiative that allows the agency to buy out badly damaged properties. North Carolina has submitted more than 500 applications totaling $240 million for that program since February, but FEMA officials have yet to approve or make final decisions on any of them.
“Further delay of these approvals keeps communities and families in limbo, in some cases paying expenses on homes they cannot live in while they await word from FEMA,” Stein wrote to Evans.
Stein also asked the agency to expedite other pending aid. Requests for more than $1 billion in total public assistance dollars for North Carolina remain pending within the agency, according to the governor. State officials have repeatedly pointed to increased bureaucratic obstacles, including personal approval by Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, on payments from FEMA to the state.
“The reimbursement process is particularly onerous for local governments, many of which are struggling to fund essential services like trash pickup and law enforcement,” Stein wrote.
City and county governments in western North Carolina have faced significant budget shortfalls in recent months — a combination of decreased revenue over the past year and payments for Helene recovery that have yet to be reimbursed by the federal government.
FEMA did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Evans began leading FEMA at the beginning of December, the latest in a series of interim leaders at an agency whose fate is uncertain under the Trump administration but which remains crucial to North Carolina’s Helene recovery.
Her predecessor, David Richardson, resigned last month after he failed to appear or speak publicly after flooding in Central Texas. Cameron Hamilton, who led the agency before Richardson, was fired in May after he told Congress that he believed the agency should remain in place.
State officials leading Helene operations have touted the speed of the recovery, particularly with regard to their home repair and rebuilding program. But they have repeatedly pointed to federal bureaucracy as a key sticking point, failing to reimburse the state and local governments in a timely manner more than a year after Helene hit the mountains.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/IMG_3910-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 14:57:24.534038

Spencer Cox on Sunday called the Utah Legislature into a special session set for Tuesday evening to consider a slate of bills meant to “facilitate” Republican state leaders’ appeal fighting the state’s court-ordered redistricting process and its resulting congressional map that created a Democratic-leaning district. 
“I support the state’s appeal and have confidence the Utah Supreme Court will consider it in a timely way so we have clarity for the 2026 election,” Cox said in a post on X late Sunday.

The governor also included on the special session agenda legislation to repeal a controversial law prohibiting public workers’ unions — including those that represent firefighters, school teachers, police officers and other government workers — from collective bargaining. 
“I support the repeal, and appreciate the Legislature’s work to refocus this conversation to ensure government is doing its best to support our first responders, educators, and all those who serve our state,” the governor said. 
The House and Senate are scheduled to convene for the special session at 6 p.m. Tuesday. 
Ahead of the session, anti-gerrymandering groups supportive of 3rd District Judge Dianna Gibson’s redistricting ruling and pro-public labor union groups are expected to rally together at the Utah Capitol in Salt Lake City.
Redistricting
Last month, Utah’s Republican legislative leaders held a news conference to announce their plans to appeal Utah’s new court-ordered congressional map to the Utah Supreme Court, calling it the “most gerrymandered map in the history of the state of Utah.” 
They also announced they would be holding a special session to consider extending congressional candidate filing deadlines in order to allow more time for the possibility of a different congressional map to be enacted before the 2026 elections. 
In redistricting fight, Utah Republican lawmakers will appeal to Utah Supreme Court

“Utahns deserve a stable, transparent and accountable process for redistricting, one that respects the roles of our elected branches and the voice of the people,” Senate President Stuart Adams, R-Layton, and House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper, said in a prepared statement. 
They pointed to a recent poll by The Sutherland Institute, a conservative think tank, that suggests a majority of Utah voters think elected officials should be making redistricting decisions, not judges. 
“The Legislature is taking action to restore order, ensure transparency and defend the integrity of our elections, keeping Utah’s constitutional framework strong and stable,” Schultz and Adams said.
During Tuesday’s special session, lawmakers plan to consider the following, according to a news release issued by Adams and Schultz’s offices: 

Election Amendments, a bill sponsored by Sen. Scott Sandall, R-Tremonton, and Rep. Karen Petersen, R-Clinton. The bill “adjusts congressional filing deadlines to provide candidates clarity and election officials time to prepare,” pushing the congressional candidate filing period back by about two months, to March 9-13. The bill also “preserves existing processes for all other candidates not impacted by the court ruling, with no changes to primaries or conventions.” For congressional candidates gathering signatures to qualify for the ballot, the bill will set a window of time to file a notice of intent to gather signatures from Jan. 2 to March 13, with signature thresholds staying the same. 
Court Procedure Resolution & Supreme Court Jurisdiction, a bill sponsored by Sen. Brady Brammer, R-Provo, and Rep. Jefferson Burton, R-Salem. The bill is expected to make changes to court rules related to appeals by government officers or government entities regarding election, voting and redistricting cases, according to the governor’s call. It will propose delaying attorney fee determinations in election cases until after the appeal process has concluded and exempting a government official or entity from posting bond to appeal a case. It will also make clear that the Utah Supreme Court has “exclusive and original appellate jurisdiction over election and redistricting cases,” according to the House and Senate news release. 

Joint Resolution Regarding Constitutional Authority, a resolution sponsored by House Majority Leader Casey Snider, R-Paradise, and Senate Majority Whip Chris Wilson, R-Logan, to affirm that the “Legislature, who is elected by and accountable to Utahns, has constitutional responsibility over redistricting.” It’s also expected to condemn “the courts’ novel interpretations of the Utah Constitution that infringe on that authority and silences Utahns’ voices.” 

In a ruling last month, Gibson overwhelmingly sided with the plaintiffs in a redistricting lawsuit against the Utah Legislature, blocking the GOP-controlled Legislature’s preferred map from being used in the 2026 elections and instead approving one of the plaintiffs’ submitted alternatives, known as Map 1. 
The Legislature’s map, she wrote, “fails in many ways to comply with Proposition 4,” a 2018 voter-approved law establishing an independent redistricting process and neutral map-drawing criteria. 
Utah’s mid-decade redistricting process and its resulting new, court-ordered congressional map was the result of an earlier ruling issued this summer, when Gibson voided Utah’s last congressional map that the Utah Legislature set in 2021. 
In that decision, the judge ruled the 2021 map was the result of an unconstitutional process after she determined the Utah Legislature overstepped its constitutional authority when it undid Proposition 4. In that ruling, Gibson restored Proposition 4 as law while ordering a “remedial” redistricting process to choose a new congressional map in time for the 2026 election. 
Redistricting ruling: Utah judge picks plaintiffs’ congressional map, blocks Legislature’s

Fighting the courts every step of the way, the Utah’s Republican legislative leaders have accused Gibson of violating the Utah Constitution when she picked a map that wasn’t adopted by the Utah Legislature, which GOP lawmakers continue to argue — despite multiple court rulings against them in the state’s yearslong redistricting court battle — has the sole authority to redistrict. 
Plaintiffs in the state’s redistricting lawsuit have pointed to court proceedings in other states and  argued the courts have a duty to intervene and select “remedial” maps when they determine lawmakers have failed to follow the law. But Republican lawmakers contend the judge should have gone another route, like asking the Legislature to vote on an alternative, rather than picking a map and sidelining the Legislature. 
The plaintiffs and anti-gerrymandering groups have argued that Republican lawmakers have long gerrymandered Utah’s congressional maps in the GOP’s favor, and they celebrated Gibson’s map selection as one that most closely follows Proposition 4’s neutral map-drawing criteria and reflects the state’s “political geography” with a district that best represents its urban core in Salt Lake County. 
But the map’s critics argue it created four uncompetitive districts that lead to skewed partisan results in a state that’s dominated by a statewide majority of Republican voters.
The plaintiffs’ selected map was generated by a computer algorithm designed to comply with Proposition 4, which first and foremost calls for minimization of city and county splits. 
Public union law repeal
The repeal of the anti-public union law, HB267, comes after a coalition of labor unions submitted 320,000 signatures in support of a referendum to ask Utah voters to overturn the law in the 2026 general election. The groups far exceeded the signature threshold needed to qualify the referendum for the ballot — and in May the law was put on hold until voters could decide its fate. 
With enough signatures confirmed, controversial union law put on hold

But rather than waiting for the repeal of HB267 to go to a vote, the Utah Legislature will be taking matters into its own hands. 
In a lengthy statement posted on X late Sunday, the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Jordan Teuscher, R-South Jordan, said the ideas originally behind the law — meant to “end exclusive, behind-closed-doors collective bargaining that shut out many workers” and to bring “accountability” to pay raises and personnel policies — “remain just as important today as they were when the bill passed.” 
“However, it’s clear that the debate surrounding HB267 has been overshadowed by misinformation and unnecessary division,” Teuscher wrote. “That was never the intent. Repealing the bill now allows us to step back, lower the temperature, and create space for a clearer and more constructive conversation.” 
The labor groups coalition Protect Utah Workers fought vehemently against HB267, arguing it would effectively gut the power of public labor unions by collective bargaining, the process where unions meet with employers to negotiate a contract or terms of employment. 
In a statement issued Sunday night the Protect Utah Workers coalition thanked legislative leaders for “respecting the will of the people.”

“This anticipated repeal preserves the rights of firefighters, police, nurses, public educators, transportation workers, airport staff, and all other critical public workers who improve the lives of Utahns every day,” the coalition said. 
Protect Utah Workers organizers also credited the repeal to people who got involved in the referendum effort. 
“The expected repeal belongs to the Utahns who stood up and signed the referendum,” the coalition said. “More than 320,000 people who signed the petition sent a clear message that public workers deserve a voice on the job.”
Teuscher, however, indicated that he won’t be abandoning his legislative efforts around public unions. 
“Moving forward, I appreciate the willingness of Protect Utah Workers to engage in good faith, and I intend to work closely with union leaders, public employees, and Utahns across the state in the coming year to determine the best path forward,” he said. “My focus is on developing policies that protects public workers, supports taxpayers, and keeps Utah’s public employment practices open, responsible, and grounded in good governance.”",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111025_Salt-Lake-City_01-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

The rising cost of housing continues to be a huge problem for millions of Americans. But, of course, as just about any average person can also confirm, lack of affordability is not just a problem confined to housing – it’s spreading across the U.S. economy in dozens of areas. So, what’s going on here? During the COVID pandemic, we knew precisely what was going on – a huge drop in supply that was giving rise to rapid inflation, and that problem was rapidly and successfully addressed during the Biden presidency.
So why are prices going up again and what should elected leaders be doing about it? Recently Newsline got a chance to discuss these and some related matters in an extended conversation with NC State extension economist and professor emeritus Mike Walden.
In Part One of our extended conversation, we discussed the affordability crisis that’s plaguing millions of average Americans – and how President Donald Trump’s tariffs are contributing to the problem and undermining the bold promises he made to Americans during the 2024 election.
In Part Two of our chat, we dug deeper into some of the economic challenges that confront the nation, including the impact of artificial intelligence, the changing nature of work, the ongoing disinvestment in research in higher education and the soaring costs of health care.

In an opinion issued Monday, Court of Claims Judge Sima Patel said she was denying a request for a preliminary injunction from the plaintiffs in Holistic Research Group Inc./Michigan Cannabis Industry v. Michigan Department of Treasury.
The consolidated lawsuits posited that the new tax, passed in October as part of a comprehensive 2025-26 budget deal to raise new revenue for road repairs and rebuilds through 2030, was unconstitutional because it violated the title-object clause of the state’s Constitution.
Patel on Monday, after hearing oral arguments in the matter in November, said the industry advocates didn’t make a supported argument that a real constitutional issue existed, nor did the group succinctly show that the Michigan Regulation and Taxation of Marijuana Act, which legalized the use and sale of cannabis in Michigan, was the only statutory mechanism to enact taxes on pot.
Critics warn Michigan’s 24% pot tax could crush small retailers, boost black market, hurt patients

“The (road funding act) is consistent with the (maraijuana taxation act). The plaintiffs contend that the phrase ‘all other taxes’ … refers only to generally applicable taxes, like the 6% sales tax imposed on all retail sales. If that were true, however, the initiative could have simply said that. Instead, the initiative stated plainly that the 10% retail excise tax was in addition to ‘all other taxes.’ And the phrase ‘all other’ is broad and expansive. According to the plain meaning of these terms, ‘all other taxes’ broadly means all taxes other than the tax imposed by (the marijuana taxation act).”
Patel further noted that the Legislature did not directly amend any of the existing taxes in the regulatory act or replace it with the new tax in the road funding legislation; rather, the Legislature imposed a new separate tax, which is permitted under the regulatory act.
“The two statutes can be read together,” Patel wrote.

The claim regarding the mechanism by which a new tax could be enacted was therefore dismissed, Patel wrote.
Patel did, however, allow the case to move forward to determine if the tax interferes with the intent of the voter-initiated law that allowed marijuana consumption, regulations and sales. Patel said a genuine issue of fact remained on that issue, which required further consideration before the court.
“The court must consider the intentions of the (taxation act) drafters and the impact of the new wholesale excise tax on the purposes of the (taxation act),” Patel wrote. “The court may not resolve such factual questions at the summary disposition phase. Discovery will be required to develop the evidence needed to support the parties’ positions in this regard.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/marijuana-700x467-1.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

It’s one of the first times Fitch has publicly acknowledged there may be better ways for Mississippi to manage the money it’s won in the national opioid lawsuits, cases that charged some of the country’s biggest companies with contributing to a public health crisis that’s killed over 10,000 Mississippians since 2000. 
The Attorney General’s office sent an email addressed to Lt. Gov. Delbert Hosemann and Speaker of the House Jason White late Friday afternoon with two attachments: a finalized list of applications seeking to spend some of the state’s opioid settlement money, and a letter authored by Fitch to the Legislature.
The list, a reflection of the council’s work soliciting and scoring project applications looking to address Mississippi’s addiction crisis, tiers the 127 applications into five categories. The council recommended about $40 million of grant funding in the highest priority category and about $41 million for applications in the second highest group. 
Fitch’s letter summarizes the recommendation list and adds additional messages the council agreed to tell the Legislature. Toward the end of it, she acknowledges that she and the other members may need additional help to make sure funds are spent appropriately. 
“As we prepare for the second round of applications, the Council will be reviewing its process and may determine the need to utilize services to assist in evaluation of applications, tracking of public funds, and others to ensure that the Legislature’s priorities for accountability, transparency, and public involvement are fulfilled,” she wrote.
The Legislature created the council last spring to recommend how lawmakers should spend most of Mississippi’s opioid settlement money and appointed Fitch’s office to lead the effort. Lawmakers gave council members about five months to create application materials, review completed proposals and assess how well they believe applicant organizations will address the addiction epidemic.

The council completed these tasks in that time period, but the process was filled with a variety of issues that concerned overdose prevention advocates both on and outside of the council. From missing application materials in the summer to conflicts of interests and grading discrepancies in the fall, Mississippi Today reported on challenges that led overdose prevention advocates to worry whether the funds would help those who struggle with addiction. 
In the past, Fitch has often responded to the newsroom asking questions about these concerns without proposals to address them. When Mississippi Today asked her about the council conflicts of interest in November, her Chief of Staff Michelle Williams wrote back that the members are state leaders at addressing addiction and are positioned well to address the public health crisis. 
Her idea in the letter to seek out additional services echoes fellow council member James Moore’s message at a meeting last week. Just before the members left, he asked the committee to consider reaching out to groups with expertise in helping states manage opioid settlement funds in the future.

Also in the letter, Fitch said the state has just over $90 million in opioid settlement money that must be spent to address addiction. There’s an additional roughly $15 million in state coffers that her office and the Legislature allow lawmakers to spend the same as any public money.
The setup for those $15 million mirrors the one Fitch created for the settlement money sent to Misississippi’s cities and counties. Elected leaders can spend the money on addressing addiction but don’t have to. A September Mississippi Today investigation found that most of the settlement money local governments were spending went to general expenses rather than addressing addiction — a big reason why the state has spent less money to fight the public health crisis than any other state in the country. 

Each year since 2022, Mississippi has been paid tens of millions of opioid settlement dollars, money that is supposed to help respond to the overdose public health crisis. But 15% of those dollars — the money controlled by the state’s towns, cities and counties — is unrestricted and being spent with almost no public knowledge. Mississippi Today spent the summer finding out how almost every local government receiving money has been managing the money over the past three years.Read The Series

When Mississippi Today has asked Fitch why she allowed Mississippi to spend large chunks of the settlement funds for purposes other than addiction, her office has said the lawsuits allow for some of the money to repay past government expenses fighting the opioid epidemic.

T[...]","Dr. Evelyn Griffin, a Baton Rouge obstetrician and gynecologist, was announced Monday, Dec. 8, 2025, as Louisiana's next surgeon general. She is an appointee of U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to a vaccine advisory panel at the Centers for Diseason Control and Prevention. (Screen capture of CDC video stream)  Louisiana’s next surgeon general is a Baton Rouge physician who U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. chose for a panel that’s implementing his anti-vaccine policy recommendations. 
Dr. Evelyn Griffin, a Baton Rouge obstetrician and gynecologist, has also aligned herself with Republican Gov. Jeff Landry’s stances on the COVID-19 vaccine and abortion.
The governor’s office announced Griffin’s appointment Monday. She will replace Dr. Ralph Abraham, the state’s first surgeon general who Kennedy recently picked for the No. 2 post with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
“Dr. Evelyn Griffin embodies the expertise and commitment that the people of Louisiana deserve in a Surgeon General,” Landry said in a statement. “Her clinical experience, her leadership in advancing maternal health, and her dedication to strengthening the doctor-patient relationship make her the exact right choice for this role. With Dr. Griffin stepping in, I’m confident Louisiana is in good hands and headed toward a healthier, stronger future,”.
In late September, Kennedy picked Griffin for the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, making her one of his replacements after he removed all 17 prior members in June. Its new lineup voted Friday to update decades-old guidelines that called for newborns to be vaccinated for hepatitis B at birth. 
Griffin sided with the majority in the 8-3 vote, which will be up to acting CDC director Jim O’Neill to adopt. Its revised policy calls for the vaccine at birth only for children whose mothers test positive for the disease. Otherwise, the first dose is recommended to be delayed until the child is two months old.
During debate over the matter, Griffin made a connection between hepatitis levels in the U.S. and immigration.
“We have had years of illegal immigration, undocumented people coming in from higher endemicity countries,” she said. 
U.S. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-Louisiana, a physician with a specialty in hepatology, criticized the panel’s decision in a social media post and urged O’Neil not to accept the panel’s recommendation.
“As a liver doctor who has treated patients with hepatitis B for decades, this change to the vaccine schedule is a mistake,” Cassidy wrote on X. “The hepatitis B vaccine is safe and effective. The birth dose is a recommendation, NOT a mandate.”
“This will make America sicker,” added Cassidy, who chairs the U.S. Senate health committee and cast the deciding vote earlier this year to approve President Donald Trump’s nomination of Kennedy as health secretary. 
In the same meeting where she voted on hepatitis B vaccine policy revisions, Griffin made a presentation to committee members on the use of aluminum in vaccines as an adjuvant, which is intended to improve their efficacy. Aluminum-based adjuvants are commonly used in childhood immunizations for hepatitis B, the human papilloma virus and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP).  
Kennedy has claimed aluminum in vaccines is linked to autism and food allergies, though multiple studies have disputed that claim and shown no harmful accumulation or harmful effects from aluminum adjuvants. They include research published in July that studied more than 1.2 million children in Denmark from 1997-2018.  
Griffin said her presentation was intended to inform members of the advisory committee ahead of the possible formation of a workgroup focused on adjuvants that could make recommendations about their use in vaccines.

The December meeting was Griffin’s second as a member of the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. At her first meeting in September, she voted with the majority on a resolution to recommend ending the use of a combination vaccine for measles, mumps, rubella and chicken pox given to children before age 4. Instead, the committee suggests doctors administer the MMR and chicken pox vaccines separately. The vote followed a presentation of research that showed a slightly increased chance of fever-related seizures in children who received the four-component vaccine compared with those who received two separate shots.
Griffin previously weighed in on vaccine policy at the state level after former Gov. John Bel Edwards issued an executive order in 2021 that required students 16 and older to provide proof of the COVID-19 vaccine in order to attend school. Landry, who was attorney general at the time, joined anti-vaccine forces to have the order repealed, even though families were allowed to claim exemptions to the rule. 
At an April 2022 legislative hearing on a resolution to repeal Edwards’ order, Griffin told lawmakers “the average kid in Louisiana has a higher chance of getting struck by lightning than dying of COVID,” a claim that vaccine proponents called into question.
In her introductory speech as a new member of the CDC advisory committee in September, Griffin said she had received the COVID-19 vaccine.
“In my clinical practice in obstetrics, I had been part of initiatives for maternal immunization, including diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus,” Griffin said. “And in my overall practice, I feel like, if I was to be given a label, I would call myself pro-informed consent because of medical ethics for discussing risk, benefits and alternatives with the patient.”
Abraham offered a similar informed consent explanation when justifying his decision to forego state health department campaigns to promote and administer the flu vaccine. 
Griffin has also made public statements in support of Louisiana’s abortion ban, considered one of the nation’s strictest, that went into effect after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022. 
In May 2023, Griffin appeared before the Louisiana House Committee on the Administration of Criminal Justice to oppose a bill that would have removed a 15-year prison term and reduced a $200,000 fine for medical professionals who performed abortions. Some doctors expressed concern the state’s abortion law would result in them facing criminal charges if a colleague did not agree when a pregnancy is medically futile, a requirement to allow an emergency abortion to be performed. The proposal, sponsored by Rep. Aimee Freeman, D-New Orleans, would have allowed a single doctor to decide when an emergency abortion is warranted.     
“Our current law is not penalizing doctors who are administering standard medical care, only those who are intentionally performing abortion,” Griffin told lawmakers, who shelved the Freeman bill without taking a vote. 
Griffin has also collaborated with Louisiana Right to Life, appearing in one of its social media broadcasts to explain the post-Roe landscape for reproductive health care providers. She also joined a dozen other Louisiana doctors in signing a statement “to provide clarity that Louisiana Pro-Life Laws protect physicians’ ability to care for their patients.” The letter addresses what it calls “misinformation” and “false narratives” that have circulated since Roe v. Wade was overturned.   
“Together, let’s ensure the public knows that women’s necessary healthcare is not at stake and move forward with protecting unborn babies and their mothers,” the statement reads.
This is a developing story.

(Courtesy NMED)Two New Mexico agencies announced they have taken early steps to remediate four long-abandoned, potentially dangerous uranium mines, marking the state’s first foray into a problem experts have said is of potentially “infinite” scope and cost.
The four mines all lie in McKinley County in the Ambrosia Lake Mining District. Contractors have conducted on-site surveys, environmental sampling and other preliminary steps at the sites, according to a joint news release Friday from the New Mexico Environment Department and state Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department.
“This is the first step in a truly monumental effort to reverse the legacy of neglect,” said Miori Harms, the uranium mine reclamation coordinator at NMED, in a statement. 
The four abandoned mines are among an estimated 1,100 that dot the landscape in New Mexico, including about 500 on or near the Navajo Nation, following decades of unregulated uranium mining that left toxic pollutants on land and water. The lack of regulation and ephemeral nature of many of the mines means that, in most cases, state officials cannot determine which companies built the mines and are therefore liable for cleanup. 
A problem of ‘infinite scope and cost’

In 2022, the Legislature passed the Uranium Mine Cleanup Act, which mobilized state agencies to document and make a plan to remediate the mines. Then in the 2025 session, the Legislature agreed to put $20 million toward uranium mine cleanup. 
With the help of $12 million of that funding, state officials identified the McKinley County mines and found contractors who will clean them up. The mines are known as the “Schmitt Decline Mine,” “Moe No. 4,” “Red Bluff No. 1” and “Roundy Shaft and Manol Strip,” according to NMED.
NMED officials have said they will use $2 million of the one-time Legislature funding to try to find more owners of legacy mines, as well as $6 million next spring to truck out contaminated soil from two sites companies polluted with petroleum.
The agencies’ work at the four McKinley County sites will provide a template for future cleanups and funding needs, with more sites added to the remediation list next spring, according to NMED. 
While anti-nuclear advocates and state officials have long said the federal government should be responsible for paying for the mess, state lawmakers described the $20 million funding as a way to get started, at least.
State financial analysts have calculated that remediating all the mines would cost, at least, hundreds of millions of dollars, and a University of New Mexico study in 2020 said the cost and scope is potentially “infinite,” given the depth of the contamination that has spread unchecked for decades. 
One contractor that is tackling early site cleanup, EA Engineering, Science, and Technology, Inc., released a video outlining its initial steps for the Schmitt Mine cleanup. Drone video the company shot shows a deep hole in the ground with no signage, along with a long-abandoned vehicle nearby covered in rust. 
New Mexico starting cleanup for abandoned uranium mines, but officials say more funding needed

Leona Morgan, a longtime Diné anti-nuclear activist, told Source New Mexico on Monday that she appreciates the state using its own funding to start remediation, even though it represents a fraction of the estimated cost to clean up the mines statewide. 
“It’s just scratching the surface, literally,” she said. “I know it’s just preliminary, like, these first actions will inform future actions. So my concern is getting more money, especially from the federal government, securing the funds needed for all of the orphaned mines.”
But she also urged state contractors to conduct adequate preliminary — including culturally-sensitive — community outreach, and she hopes that the state avoids repeating the mistakes of the past by ceasing to monitor mines after they’ve remediated them. A changing climate makes constant vigilance necessary, she said. 
“We can never consider these sites 100% remediated and, you know, pat ourselves on the back, like, ‘Oh, job well done,’ and walk away,” she said. “These are permanent liability sites.”
The state’s announcement said it will produce quarterly progress reports, including one it released Monday. 
The report says officials selected the four mines due to a variety of factors, including ease of access, proximity to homes and the hazard they pose. But the NMED is still working on a ranking which sites are the highest priorities, noting that it hasn’t yet completed assessments for all neglected sites and that “prioritization work” is underway under a separate contract. 
The agency also pointed the public to its dashboard, which contains a map and database with the history, location and remediation progress on statewide abandoned uranium mines. 
“We are making meaningful efforts to protect communities,” Environment Secretary James Kenney said in the statement. “This initiative is about taking concrete steps to finally address the unfinished business of abandoned uranium mine cleanup.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Screen-Shot-2025-12-08-at-11.14.16-AM-1024x597.png,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

Bird, a Westminster Democrat, will step down on Jan. 5 ahead of the 2026 legislative session, meaning a vacancy committee will convene to find her replacement. She represents House District 29, which includes northern parts of Jefferson County and Adams County bordering Broomfield.
“With the upcoming legislative session beginning on January 14, the people of House District 29 deserve a representative who will be fully focused on legislative matters — and the voters of the Eighth Congressional District deserve a candidate who is able to put in the 70+ hours a week of work that it will take to flip this seat from red to blue,” Bird said in a statement.
Evans, a Republican, unseated former Democratic U.S. Rep. Yadira Caraveo, who was the first person to represent the district. Caraveo in September dropped her bid to reclaim the congressional seat. Colorado state Rep. Manny Rutinel, a Commerce City Democrat, is also running for the seat, as well as Colorado Treasurer Dave Young and Marine veteran Evan Munsing. The Democratic primary election in June will determine which candidate will face Evans in November.
Before announcing her congressional bid, Bird served on the Colorado Legislature’s powerful Joint Budget Committee, which drafts the annual state budget. She was first elected to the Legislature in 2018 after a stint on the Westminster City Council.

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — After meeting in closed session for over 90 minutes Monday, the Nebraska Legislature’s Executive Board opted to delay a vote on how it will respond to groping allegations against State Sen. Dan McKeon of Amherst.
The Executive Board, which is in charge of handling disciplinary procedures within the Legislature, met at least once on Oct. 27 to discuss the same situation in another closed session, said State Sen. Ben Hansen of Blair, who chairs the group. They met a second time Monday but adjourned without reaching a resolution.
The Nebraska State Patrol cited McKeon for misdemeanor public indecency in late October after investigating an allegation by a legislative staffer attending an end-of-session party this spring in Lincoln. The Patrol received a report in early September that McKeon allegedly “made inappropriate contact with her buttocks with his hand, over the top of her clothing,” Patrol spokesman Cody Thomas said at the time.

During the Executive Board’s Oct. 27 meeting, Hansen said the group agreed to move McKeon’s former first-floor office, exchanging it with another first floor office previously occupied by State Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman. He did not specify why the board felt the move was necessary.
Hansen said the board had a “great discussion” about the situation Monday, but he ultimately felt it would be best to hold off on any formal decisions until the full board was able to attend. Three voting members of the 10-member board were absent Monday — State Sens. John Arch, John Fredrickson and Mike Jacobson. Fredrickson was absent due to a canceled flight, Hansen said, while Arch and Jacobson notified him that they wouldn’t be able to attend in advance.
“I want to make sure we’re all together if we make any kind of decision of this magnitude,” Hansen said.
Hansen said he’s targeting Saturday for the board’s next meeting, that being the earliest date that all members can participate.
Typically, legislative committees are not allowed to vote in private sessions, but Clerk of the Legislature Brandon Metzler said some “administrative” exceptions might apply to the Executive Board. This would apply to McKeon’s office move, which was voted on in closed session.
The Executive Board is obligated to take action in response to allegations of workplace harassment within 45 days of the initial report’s filing, per the Legislature’s workplace harassment policy. Hansen said the board fulfilled its obligations in the actions it took Oct. 27.
McKeon is a registered Republican who was elected to the officially nonpartisan Legislature in 2024, replacing former State Sen. Fred Meyer of St. Paul. McKeon’s biographical page on the Legislature’s website highlights that he has been married for 30 years and has four children.

Gov. Jim Pillen and other state officials have called for McKeon’s resignation, but McKeon has said he will not resign.
McKeon has made several statements about the incident since the citation was issued, including a July 28 letter he sent to the staffer, and a broader statement through his attorney Perry Pirsch. In those statements, McKeon acknowledged the incident occurred but denied the woman’s allegations, describing the incident as a “light-hearted exchange” that he argued did not qualify as public indecency.

Pirsch said McKeon “made a single remark — a joke — to a staff member about her planned trip and hoping she and her husband would receive a ‘Hawaiian lei,’ or words to that effect, and he then patted her on the back.”
“It was meant in jest, and nothing about his action was in any way sexually charged or lewd, just a bad pun,” Pirsch said in the statement.
State Sen. Myron Dorn of Adams, a member of the Executive Board, previously told the Examiner that board members were advised by legal counsel to be cautious in their public statements about the situation.
This is because they don’t want to inadvertently do something that could impede the Patrol’s investigation, Dorn said. However, Hansen said Monday that the ongoing criminal investigation is not influencing the board’s actions.
McKeon is expected in Lancaster County Court Dec. 10, authorities said.

The delegation wrote that the E.U. regulations “introduce substantial uncertainty” for the forestry industry and “risks further depressing already strained log and wood-product markets, harming rural communities that depend on healthy, functioning timber economies.”
While the delegation’s letter primarily focused on the state’s $15-billion a year forestry industry, the regulations apply to other agricultural products, such as cattle and soybeans. 
In 2023, the E.U. revised its timber supply chain regulations to curb deforestation, clearing trees and converting forest land to another use, such as agriculture. The new regulations, which will start to be implemented on Dec. 30, require companies importing wood and certain agricultural products to certify that their products were not produced on recently deforested land.
The delegation said this is an infringement on “American private property rights.”
Casey Anderson, executive director of the Mississippi Forestry Association says that as a consequence of the new regulations, some producers are being asked to sign contracts by traders saying that they will not convert the land. Landowners are pushing back at their ability to decide how best to use the land they own.
“The E.U. is trying to dictate how we do things in the U.S.,” said Anderson. 
In a social media post, Mississippi Commissioner of Agriculture and Commerce Andy Gipson wrote, “We can never allow foreign interests and globalists to dictate the use of our land and natural resources here in Mississippi.”
Anderson points out that most producers in the U.S. practice sustainable forestry. And in the delegation’s letter, they highlighted that the E.U. considers the U.S. to have “negligible or insignificant levels of deforestation.” 
Mississippi and much of the South’s forestry industry has struggled in recent decades and is facing low prices. 
“It can really do a lot of harm if it goes through,” said Anderson of the new regulations.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/06172847/20211014_carbon_trees.jpg,,,2025-12-08 13:57:44.166539

It’s common knowledge that the nation’s housing market – especially in growing areas like North Carolina – has become prohibitively expensive for millions of people, and a new report from researchers at the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy and the Center for Geospatial Solutions (which is housed at the institute) highlights a major culprit – the rising tide of corporate ownership of the nation’s residential housing stock.
According to the report – which is entitled “Who Owns America,” nearly 9% of residential parcels in 500 U.S. counties are owned by a corporation and the concentrations exceed 20% in some cities. What’s more, the trend is expanding rapidly, and it’s further complicating the already deeply challenging housing market for first-time buyers. And recently to learn more about the report and the housing market challenges it helps to highlight, we caught up with the national housing reporter for the news outlet, Stateline, Robbie Sequeria.

One lesson in particular stayed with me: “Make eye contact and small talk.” In simple terms: talk to your neighbors. Seek face-to-face connection. Humanize one another.
In 2024, I ran and won my race for State Representative by knocking on more doors than anyone else in the state —and it worked. And amid the polarization in our state, our nation, and our world, Snyder’s advice feels urgently relevant.

Nick Menapace

Although I was not on the ballot in 2025, I spent months holding a listening tour across my district. Those conversations reinforced a truth that rarely appears in our social media feeds: people, when they speak in person, are far more thoughtful, reasonable, and compassionate than online discourse suggests.
Online, disagreement quickly hardens into hostility. Algorithms reward anger over understanding. People retreat into echo chambers that tell them not only what to think, but whom to fear. And increasingly, we’ve learned that some of the people fueling this anger and misinformation are being paid to do so— or are not who they claim to be. In that environment, it becomes easy to blame one another instead of asking what solutions might actually help our communities.
It’s tempting to dismiss the most aggressive online voices as “keyboard warriors,” but I’ve found that most people express hostility out of fear, not malice. Rapid economic shifts, rising costs, global instability, and local uncertainty leave many feeling unmoored. Fear convinces them that someone —usually someone different from them— is the cause of their anxiety. Fear convinces them that empathy is weakness. And fear convinces them that other people’s suffering is inevitable, or even deserved.
But when you sit across from someone at their kitchen table or at a town hall, that fear softens. People ask honest questions. They listen. They share their worries about their families, their jobs, and their bills. They want practical solutions, not partisan talking points. And more often than not, they want the same basic things: stability, safety, opportunity, and a government that works.
I was recognized for bipartisan work in Hartford this last session. That mattered to me because it reflects a principle I hold deeply: government works best when we approach one another as partners in problem-solving, not opponents in a culture war. But political incentives —especially online— too often reward division over governance.
That dynamic is dangerous because the challenges facing Connecticut are real and complex. They require sustained focus, long-term planning, and cooperation. They cannot be solved through outrage or one-minute video clips.
Consider our statewide priorities:
Energy affordability. Connecticut families pay some of the highest energy costs in the country. The most reliable way to bring those costs down is to expand the use of the lowest-cost, most proven sources: solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, and nuclear power. Other states and nations are moving rapidly in this direction. We should, too.
Healthcare access and cost. Expanding Husky to all Connecticut residents would reduce overall system costs and ensure every resident can access care without financial risk.
Taxes. If we want to lower the sales tax and reduce income taxes for everyday people, we need to modernize our fiscal guardrails and build a long-term plan that reflects how people actually live and work. That requires serious bipartisan engagement.
Housing and property taxes. The most effective way to stabilize property taxes is to expand the municipal tax base. That means building smart, fiscally sound housing that allows young people, families, and seniors to stay in Connecticut. This is the conclusion reached by municipal leaders, economists, and national experts. Our recent housing bill is a start —but only a start.
Transportation. Reducing congestion and long-term infrastructure costs requires greater investment in public transit, walkable town centers, and bikeable infrastructure. These investments are not ideological —they are economic development tools.
None of these solutions are radical. All are grounded in research and successful models nationwide. The question is not whether solutions exist; it is whether we can build the trust and civic culture necessary to implement them.
Which brings me back to Snyder’s lesson. Algorithms, headlines, or viral posts do not sustain democracy. It is sustained by people looking each other in the eye and choosing cooperation over contempt.
If Connecticut is to flourish in the decades ahead, we must recommit to the simplest democratic act: talking to one another. More listening, less shouting. More shared responsibility, less shared resentment. We can solve the challenges before us —but only if we face them together.
The future of our democracy begins with a conversation. So let’s have it.

Wray, who served 10 terms in the House, lost a close primary race to Democratic incumbent Rep. Rodney Pierce by 34 votes last year. 
Wray was criticized by Pierce and other Democrats for siding with the Republican House majority on key votes, including veto overrides. 
Wray posted his appeal to Republicans on his campaign Facebook page on Monday morning.

“Are you a Republican and want to support me in the primary election against Rodney Pierce?” the post reads.
“You can temporarily change your party affiliation to UNAFFILIATED, but you must do so BEFORE FEBRUARY 6TH. If you make the switch, remember that on election day, you must ask for a Democratic ballot in order to vote for Michael,” the post says. 
As he announced his plans for a rematch, Wray leaned into his work with Republicans, saying it helped him secure money for the district. 
“I am not going to apologize for working in the back rooms of the State Legislature to make sure that our region gets money from the state budget,” Wray said in a July statement. 
The district includes Warren, Halifax and Northampton counties. It is heavily Democratic, so the primary winner will likely win the seat. 
Pierce faced no general election opponent last year. 
Pierce said in a fundraising email last month that district residents haven’t benefited from the successes Wray claims. 
Wray’s appeal to Republicans is not surprising, Pierce said in a statement Monday.  
“My opponent has been misleading voters for years,” Pierce said. “He thinks that Democratic voters are dumb, which is why they rejected him the last time. While I represent all of my neighbors here in District 27, I’m running as a Democrat.”
In a statement provided to NC Newsline, Wray said he’s providing information to Republicans who support him on how to vote for him.

Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/ct-transportation-borrowing/,"Stagnant fuel and sales tax revenues mean CT will have to roll back plans to boost transportation borrowing, according to a new report.","An ongoing surge in state borrowing to rebuild Connecticut’s aging transportation infrastructure must be rolled back, Gov. Ned Lamont’s administration projects, because of stagnant fuel and sales tax revenues.
But business leaders and a key legislator insist Connecticut has other options to maintain expanded financing for highway, bridge and rail upgrades, including scaling back one of the governor’s favorite programs: an aggressive effort to pay down pension debt.
And while Lamont downplayed the revenue challenges last week, saying the impact wouldn’t be felt for several more years, his budget staff projected borrowing levels to be reduced starting in the next fiscal year, which begins July 1.
Just 12 months after the Lamont administration reported that Connecticut was ready to increase a key element of its transportation construction budget by 40%, from $1 billion to $1.4 billion, by 2028, a new forecast held that three-quarters of that planned growth is unaffordable under the current system.
That $400 million in new borrowing anticipated for the 2026-27 and 2027-28 fiscal years should be stalled, according to recommendations in the Fiscal Accountability Report issued Nov. 20 by the Office of Policy and Management, Lamont’s chief budget and planning agency. 
Reversing plans to invest hundreds of millions in infrastructure work will have a chilling effect on industry hiring plans, said Donald Shubert, president of the Connecticut Construction Industry Association.
“The minute they see any kind of uncertainty, or the minute they get any clue things are slowing down, they pull back,” Shubert told the Connecticut Mirror. “We pull back and that slows the economic activity or the economic benefits — immediately.”
The Connecticut Business and Industry Association’s vice president for public policy, Chris Davis, said that “any business that’s on the fence” about hiring or otherwise expanding, “they need that [state funding] stability to make those types of investments.”
Twelve months ago, in the 2024-25 fiscal year, while Connecticut was borrowing $1 billion for its transportation rebuild, Lamont’s budget staff said that should grow to $1.3 billion in 2025-26, $1.4 billion in 2026-27, and then remain at that level through at least 2029 – a prediction that excited industry and construction trade leaders.
Now the administration wants to stick with $1.3 billion in borrowing for 2025-26, but drop to $1.2 billion in 2026-27, $1.1 billion in 2027-28, and remain there through 2030. And given inflation in the construction industry, $1.1 billion in the late 2020s would reflect little increase, if any, beyond the $1 billion Connecticut borrowed last fiscal year.
Borrowing through bond sales, coupled with matching federal grants, are the two ways Connecticut pays for the overwhelming bulk of its transportation construction projects.
Slowing revenue growth is a solvable problem
So why does Lamont now expect to forego most of that funding growth he envisioned just one year ago?
The administration points to the $2.3 billion Special Transportation Fund, which represents 8% of the overall state budget, and covers the principal and interest payments on infrastructure projects, as well as operating expenses for the Transportation and Motor Vehicles departments.
Twelve months ago, Lamont’s budget office expected annual tax revenues supporting the fund to grow almost 4.5%, or $84 million, by 2028. Now they say those sources — two fuel levies, a portion of sales tax receipts, and a highway mileage fee on most large trucks — will effectively remain flat, growing by less than $6 million over the next three years.
The administration projects this sluggish revenue growth, coupled with rising costs, will push the STF into insolvency by 2029. But this is common outcome when projecting a state program’s finances out four or five years into the future, at which point inflation normally outpaces revenue growth.
Still, learning $84 million in expected extra tax receipts by 2028 largely won’t happen is problematic.
Tens of millions of extra dollars for annual debt service payments would allow for hundreds of millions of dollars in additional yearly borrowing for construction work. That’s because the state pays off various projects across 15 or 20 years.
But compensating for losing roughly $80 million in expected revenue growth also is far from unsolvable.
And some of the first solutions that might come to mind are untenable or unnecessary.
Lamont would not need the electronic highway tolls he sought in 2019 and 2020, nor the $600 million they would generate annually, far more than needed to fill an $80 million gap.
And given that both the governor’s office and all legislators are up for reelection next November, any hike in fuel or sales taxes — which would raise far less than tolls but still enough to cover the gap — also is likely off the table.
But there are still more options.
Will Lamont ease budget controls to grow construction work?
The overall state budget’s General Fund, which covers about 90% of all operating expenses, has been sharing some of its resources with the transportation fund since the late 1990s. The last major change occurred in 2015 when legislators and then-Gov. Dannel P. Malloy assigned about 1/13th of annual sales tax receipts, which currently exceed $5.2 billion — to the STF.
And the General Fund has generated unprecedented surpluses, averaging more than $1.8 billion or 8% to 9% of the fund, since 2017, thanks to aggressive budget caps installed at that time that force big savings.
Most of those unspent dollars, about $10 billion in total since 2020, have been used to reduce the massive pension debt Connecticut amassed across seven decades prior to 2011. And that’s in addition to the more than $3 billion in mandatory pension contributions Connecticut makes annually.
Lamont, a fiscal moderate, has been reluctant to scale back that savings effort, though, given Connecticut still owes more than $33 billion in this area. His critics, including many of his fellow Democrats in the General Assembly, say this effort is too aggressive and is draining funds from education, health care, municipal aid and other core programs.
They also note the governor has proposed saving less, himself, on a few occasions.
He signed big state tax cuts, which take hundreds of millions annually away from surpluses, in 2022 and 2023, just before and after he successfully ran for a second four-year term. He also proposed and won legislative approval last year for a new endowment to bolster affordable child care. That last initiative took $300 million from last year’s General Fund surplus and is expected to collect tens or hundreds of millions from future surpluses indefinitely.
Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Transportation Committee, said Connecticut should not abandon what amounts to a huge planned investment in new construction jobs and in the state’s economy.
“If we really do something like that, we’re not looking at the big picture,” she said, adding that by rebuilding the state’s aging highways, bridges and rail lines, “we create a vibrant economic picture for our state.”
Cohen also praised Connecticut’s savings habits in recent years and said the state should continue to whittle down its pension debt.
But “I also recognize times change,” she added, “and sometimes minor adjustments are needed.”
Shubert’s association has asserted for years that Connecticut should be borrowing more than $1.5 billion annually to rebuild a transportation network that is one of the nation’s oldest.
According to the American Road & Transportation Builders Association, Connecticut ranks 35th in the nation, 1st being the worst, in terms of the share of its highway bridges considered “structurally deficient.” But when it comes to the percentage of bridge area that falls into this category, Connecticut ranks in the worst 15 states, according to the association.
Being “structurally deficient” doesn’t mean the bridge is functionally obsolete but at least one key component, such as a deck or culverts, is rated in “poor” or worse condition. And though not necessarily unsafe, the bridge requires significant repair or monitoring.
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, declined to say what changes the governor might recommend when he proposes his next budget to the General Assembly on Feb. 4 but added “We expect considerable discussion around this [transportation] question in the coming months.”
Lamont has pressed lawmakers in recent years to consider cutbacks to public transit programs, including higher rail and bus fares to reduce the need for state subsidies. This also could help offset sluggish revenue growth and make more borrowing for transportation construction possible.
But Cohen was skeptical the Democratic-controlled General Assembly would look to tighten belts further in this area.
“I certainly hope not,” she said. “I want to see more people on public transportation and that means putting investments there.”
Governor downplays transportation funding challenges
The governor downplayed the transportation funding challenges when discussing them with reporters last week.
Federal transportation funding has been on the rise since 2021, when President Joe Biden and Congress enacted an aggressive $1.2 trillion transportation infrastructure program, Lamont said, adding that “2030 is a long way away. A lot can change.”
But President Donald Trump already rolled back some of that infrastructure funding in July when he signed an omnibus federal spending and tax measure.
Trump also has told states he intends to link future federal transportation funding, “to the maximum extent permitted by law,”  to local compliance with federal policies on vaccines and immigration enforcement — issues on which many Connecticut officials and the president disagree.
State Department of Transportation Commissioner Garrett Eucalitto said the transportation fund revenues and changes at the federal level do present challenges to Connecticut’s construction program.
But the department also has adjusted its capital program to ease demand for more state investments “without compromising the long-term health of our transportation system. [The department] will also continue seeking competitive federal grant opportunities.”
The DOT has more than 650 active infrastructure projects, Eucalitto said, adding “We will continue to invest strategically in aging infrastructure … directing funds where they deliver the greatest benefit to Connecticut residents, communities and businesses.”
Keith R. Brothers, president of the Connecticut Building Trades Council, said that since Lamont took office in 2019, a robust 90% of his organization’s members in transportation construction-related trades have been employed.
“I have all the confidence in the world,” Brothers added, “that Gov. Lamont is going to keep us working.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/GoldStarBridge_090417a013-e1470924753243.jpg,,,2025-12-08 12:58:50.744504

For families who have already checked off the bigger city parades, Greenwood offers something a little different.
Jamie Kleman | Contributing Writer Delaware Live | December 2025
If your family is still looking for a classic small-town Christmas parade to round out the season, Greenwood has you covered. The annual Greenwood Christmas Parade returns Friday, December 12, with a charming Santa’s Workshop theme that captures everything people love about a hometown holiday celebration and a winter night out.
The parade steps off at 7 p.m. in the heart of Greenwood, giving families time to grab an early dinner, bundle up, and stake out a good viewing spot before the first lights roll by. Organizers encourage spectators to arrive early to enjoy the festive atmosphere and avoid last-minute parking scrambles. Greenwood is expecting visitors from across Sussex County, which adds to the lively energy along the parade route.
A big part of the fun this year happens even before the parade begins. From 4 to 6 p.m. families can stop by for photos with Santa. It is a great chance for little ones to share wish lists while parents snap keepsake pictures. This early window also gives people a chance to support local businesses, warm up with a hot drink, and ease into the evening instead of rushing in at the last minute. Parade volunteers are planning simple activities for children and encouraging residents to show their holiday spirit by dressing in bright red, green, and cozy sweaters.
As the sky gets dark Greenwood will start to glow. The Santa’s Workshop theme invites floats, marching groups, and community organizations to think in terms of toy trains, elves, peppermint stripes, candy canes, and twinkling lights. Residents can expect a mix of decorated vehicles, school and church groups, first responders, scout troops, and small businesses all doing their part to bring the North Pole to Sussex County for one night. Many participants spend weeks preparing their floats which leads to friendly competition and extra creativity.
The parade also doubles as a community fundraiser. Town organizers have highlighted gift baskets and raffle prizes tied to the event, with proceeds helping to underwrite parade expenses and future celebrations. Local businesses have stepped up to donate items and sponsorships to keep the tradition strong year after year. Proceeds will support community activities throughout the coming year.
For families who have already checked off the bigger city parades, Greenwood offers something a little different. It is intimate, easy to navigate, and full of familiar faces yet still big enough to feel special. Kids get their Santa moment, parents get that warm small town feeling, and the entire community gets a reason to gather, wave, and wish each other a merry Christmas.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/thumbnail_Greenwood-Parade.jpg,,,2025-12-08 12:58:50.744504

(Provided by S.C. Nuclear Advisory Council)A sales agreement approved Monday by Santee Cooper would eventually remove $2.7 billion worth of debt from customers’ power bills as part of a major nuclear restart in the Palmetto State.
More than eight years after abandoning the project, the state-owned utility’s governing board unanimously passed an agreement, known as a memorandum of understanding, with New York investment firm Brookfield Asset Management for the purchase of two partially built nuclear reactors at the V.C. Summer nuclear plant in Fairfield County.
Santee Cooper and Brookfield must still go through feasibility and other due diligence studies. A date for the $2.7 billion payment is unknown.
It depends on Brookfield finalizing its investment decision. An estimated date won’t be set until June.
Under the agreement, Santee Cooper will maintain an ownership interest in the reactors of up to 25%. This would give customers access to the power the reactors would produce if completed.
Santee Cooper and the now defunct South Carolina Electric & Gas started construction on the two first-of-their-kind nuclear reactors alongside an existing unit near rural Jenkinsville in early 2013. But the project was riddled with delays, cost overruns and fraud that led to multiple federal convictions of former executives.
The utilities abandoned the plant’s expansion in 2017, but not before jointly spending $9 billion on the reactors that never produced a single megawatt.
Santee Cooper’s share of the debt was $3.6 billion, which customers so far continue to pay for on their monthly bills.
“Our customers have been paying for this,” Santee Cooper CEO Jimmy Staton said. “It’s time they got some value for it.”

Shkreli enters an already crowded primary on the Democratic side of the race to replace current Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, who cannot seek reelection due to term limits and is the frontrunner in the 2026 Democratic gubernatorial primary hunt. Michigan Deputy Secretary of State Aghogho Edevbie, Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum and former state Sen. Adam Hollier of Detroit are also seeking the party’s nomination. Secretary of state candidates are nominated by the respective parties during their spring conventions.
Tim Smith is the sole Republican running on the GOP side of the primary race.
The announcement was followed swiftly by a message from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer appointing Shkreli’s successor: Joe Froelich.
“The Michigan Lottery helps us make record investments every year into our schools, and their success is supported by a team of professionals who ensure our games are run smoothly,” Whitmer said in a statement. “I’m proud to announce Joe Froehlich as acting commissioner of the Michigan Lottery, ensuring a seamless transition as Suzanna Shkreli resigns effective today. The incredible team at the Michigan Lottery will continue working together to run our games effectively and with full integrity.”
Froelich was previously the chief operating officer of the Michigan Lottery, as well as its deputy commissioner of legal affairs and charitable gaming, and the agency’s director compliance and legal affairs. He also worked in the Michigan Department of Attorney General’s office.
Whitmer also praised Shkreli as she moved on to seek a career in state politics.
“I’m grateful to Suzanna for her service to the people of Michigan as Lottery Commissioner,” Whitmer said. “She’s led the commission through multiple record-breaking years, facilitating billion-dollar investments into Michigan’s public schools.

A 33-year-old Vermonter was killed this month while serving as a medic in Ukraine, according to his parents.
Andrew David Mario, of Brattleboro, died Dec. 3 while assisting an international brigade of the Ukrainian National Guard in the Donetsk region’s Pokrovsky district, said his mother and father, Heidi and Michael Mario.
Mario is believed to be the first Green Mountain State casualty of the Russia-Ukraine war.
“He made his decision to cast his lot with the courageous citizens of that beset nation, very much aware that he was putting his life at great risk,” his parents wrote in their son’s obituary, sent to VTDigger and set for publication in local media.
The family said it learned of Mario’s death from officials at the U.S. Embassy in Kyiv.
“We do not, as yet, know the details,” Heidi Mario told VTDigger.
An autopsy could take place in Kyiv as early as Monday, she said.
Mario left for the war-torn country last summer after being “overcome with an urgent desire to make a meaningful contribution” to Ukraine since a Russian invasion in 2022, his parents wrote in his obituary. 
Mario trained with the Ukrainian National Guard before becoming a medic in the village of Zolotyi Kolodiaz alongside other global volunteers.
Russia has been pummeling Mario’s service area — an eastern Ukraine railroad hub and “gateway to the war’s most fiercely contested region,” according to reporters there — for more than a year, with its former population of 60,000 residents reduced to fewer than 1,300.
Mario, born Aug. 26, 1992, attended Guilford Central School for elementary and middle school and Brattleboro Union High School for two years before completing his education through Vermont Adult Learning.
“Although struggling throughout his life with ADHD, depression and an at times tempestuous personality, Andrew was deeply compassionate, with a lively curiosity, especially concerning history and politics, a sly sense of humor and a fiery passion for social justice,” his parents wrote in his obituary.
Mario volunteered at what’s now Brattleboro’s Groundworks Collaborative shelter, supported pipeline protesters by living in a tent at North Dakota’s Standing Rock Indian Reservation, and toured the Canadian province of Ontario with a group raising awareness about missing and exploited First Nations women and girls.
Mario also worked as a bicycle messenger in Philadelphia, a carpenter in California, an organic farmhand in Finland and Serbia, and a support staffer at the McMurdo and Amundsen-Scott South Pole scientific research stations in Antarctica.
His family is planning a memorial gathering for next spring.
“We are heartbroken,” his mother said.

The review is conducted every four years with each member country of the UN. It is a critical analysis of that country’s progress in human rights. 
The United States is the only country on the planet that failed to show up and did not even submit its report that was due on August 4. 
What happened to us — to the “shining city upon a hill”?
What have we become? 
And what message does our silence on human rights send to friends and foes alike? 
The current U.S. administration has turned its back on human rights. Consider recent events: rising numbers of extra-judicial killings; unlawful deportations without due-process hearings; escalating violence against women, girls, and trans people, including outrageous numbers of murdered pregnant women; lack of equal opportunities for people of color; the wide economic chasm between the top 1% and the rest of the country; worsening access to health care, especially for poor and rural people; increasing rates of childhood mortality from preventable diseases — and much more.
Although the U.S. didn’t submit a human rights report, we at Minnesota-based World Without Genocide and allied organizations did. Civil society organizations can introduce critical issues with what’s known as a shadow report. In these reports, issues can be raised that the country under review may have omitted or presented less than fully or with bias. We organized a coalition of national nonprofit organizations and we submitted a shadow report.
In a modern-day David and Goliath story, our shadow report excoriates the United States over its human rights abuses, exposing systemic failures that undermine the rights and dignity of people across the nation. The report offers unflinching analyses and strong recommendations that would protect and uplift all who call this country home.
Our small coalition exposed the United States, an all-powerful giant of an adversary, and provided critical information to members of the Human Rights Council. 
The report focused on the human right to bodily autonomy, which encompasses health choices, protection from violence, and personal control over all stages of one’s own reproduction. As a cornerstone of gender equality and a fundamental human right, bodily autonomy is safeguarded by international treaties, national laws and global human rights mechanisms. Our coalition report demonstrated that U.S. policies have eroded these protections, striking at the very heart of rights that should be universal and inviolable.
The UN has rescheduled the U.S. review for November 2026. We hope that the United States will show up. We will show up and update our report. We are ashamed that the United States was absent – ashamed because every other nation in the world participates, and this sets a terrible precedent that threatens to diminish the process of holding human rights as a global goal. 
Furthermore, we are ashamed because the United States has tossed aside even a pretense of concern about human rights, here and everywhere.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trumpsept232025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 11:58:02.042750

Trail Finder, a free, statewide trail website supported by the Vermont Trail Accessibility Hub, is making it easier for Vermonters of all abilities to find outdoor adventures that fit their needs. With accurate information and firsthand stories, the project is helping more people experience the joy of getting outside.

At Oakledge Park in Burlington, accessibility consultant Enock Glidden rolls onto the trail with measuring tools in hand. He checks the grade of the paved path, looks for tight turns near the shoreline, notes surface changes, and photographs rest areas under the cottonwoods.
Soon after, those observations appear on Trail Finder, a free-to-use website used by trail-seekers to discover diverse, four-season trails across Vermont. 
His review of Oakledge is part of a statewide effort supported by the Trail Accessibility Hub—a partnership of organizations managed by The Vermont Trails and Greenways Council working to expand access and improve accessibility information across Vermont’s trails.
Enock’s on-the-ground assessments of Vermont trails give trail-seekers something they’ve long needed: clear, consistent, objective accessibility information all in one place. 
“For many people with mobility, sensory, or cognitive disabilities, as well as older adults or parents with young children, planning a day outside isn’t just about choosing a trail labeled ‘easy,’ ” says Steve Engle, Director of Community Geographics, one of the organizations that oversees Trail Finder.
Details like surface, grade, width, and places to rest are important objective trail descriptors. These specifics, however, are often missing from websites, signage, and trail maps, making the research harder than the trip itself.

Trail Finder’s Growing Database 
Lacking, incomplete, or outdated trail information is the first barrier that people encounter when trying to access the outdoors. Trail Finder is working to change that. 
Thanks to recent grant funding from the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation (FPR), including a $644,000 Vermont Outdoor Recreation Economic Collaborative (VOREC)  Community Grant supporting the Trail Accessibility Hub, the Trail Finder team has been able to improve the descriptions and maps for over 125 miles of accessible pedestrian trails on the site.
Routes of all types are continuously added, from rail trails to adaptive mountain biking. Website users can click the “Access(ible) Experience” search filter to find trails that offer greater levels of access. Through the Trailside Services feature, businesses can also get listed on Trail Finder, making it easier for trail users can find restaurants, nearby accommodations, gear rentals, and guide services. 
“Trail Finder’s work to develop and expand their database of accessible trails addresses a critical gap in communication about accessible outdoor recreation,” said Claire Polfus, Recreation Program Manager for the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks, and Recreation. “It’s about giving more people the confidence to explore Vermont’s outdoors.”
Managed and maintained by Hub partners Upper Valley Trails Alliance and Community Geographics, it’s one of the few free map-based trail databases in Vermont focused on increasing access to trails. 
“Unlike other trails apps and websites out there,” says Engle, “Trail Finder relies on 100% trail manager-approved content. Postings for accessible trails on the site receive extra attention and review from Trail Finder’s administrators to ensure consistency and accuracy.”
Hub partners are not only improving existing trail descriptions and adding new ones, but also developing resources for building accessible trails and sharing first-person stories that show what accessible outdoor recreation looks and feels like across Vermont.
Since 2024, the Hub has held over a dozen informational workshops and webinars for trail managers and completed 55 trail accessibility assessments with more than 30 organizations to evaluate pedestrian, aquatic, and adaptive mountain biking routes. These assessments are in demand and help trail managers identify the specific improvements needed to enhance access or meet established accessibility standards.
An accessibility assessment is conducted with Vermont Adaptive on a mountain biking trail to determine what upgrades need to be made to the trail.
More Voices on the Trail
Greg Durso, a wheelchair athlete and program director at the Kelly Brush Foundation, played a key role in creating a series of three tutorial videos on building adaptive mountain biking trails with Hub partner The Vermont Mountain Bike Association. 
“Adaptive mountain bikes are for people who want the thrill of trail riding,” Durso said. “The main goal of adaptive trails is to provide adaptive riders the same experience as two-wheel riders.”
New Hub resource pages built with input from trail users provide detailed information on how to build accessible pedestrian trails, mountain biking trails, and aquatic entry points, along with their benefits. 
A series of audio stories developed by the Hub helps people hear what access feels like. In one, Derek Flint, who is blind, describes kayaking with his family at Green River Reservoir in Hyde Park and how accessible launches make a difference. 
“Being on a kayak…it’s a sense of freedom. I used to be able to drive, and now I get a part of that back with kayaking,” he said.
In another, hand-cyclist and wheelchair user Edie Perkins talks about her visits to the Lamoille Valley Rail Trail. 
Trail Finder also hosts a growing set of trail accessibility blog posts, including two about Edie’s trips to Raven Ridge in Charlotte and Vermont Institute of Natural Science (VINS) in Quechee, and the confidence that comes with clear, accurate information.
“Everything felt thoughtfully designed for accessibility without losing that wild, natural feel,” Perkins shared in a post she recently wrote about VINS for Trail Finder. “The paths are subtle, the views are incredible, and the experience left me grinning ear to ear…the sense of peace was exactly what I’d hoped for.” 
Edie Perkins takes in the view from the end of the accessible trail at the Raven Ridge Natural Area, Monkton, Vermont.

Mike Jones of Richmond clinched the Democratic nomination Sunday evening for next month’s special election in Virginia’s Senate District 15, defeating Del. Debra Gardner, D-Chesterfield, in a firehouse primary. The spotlight now shifts to a January showdown for control of a key Virginia Senate seat.
Jones, first elected to the House in 2023, will face Republican John Thomas next month in a race Democrats view as critical to protecting their narrow 21–19 majority in the Virginia Senate. 
The solidly Democratic district, which covers parts of Richmond and northern Chesterfield County, is expected to be one of the first major tests of the party’s strength heading into the 2026 General Assembly session.
Sunday’s firehouse primary — a rapid, party-run process held under a compressed timeline after Lt. Gov.-elect Ghazala Hashmi resigned to prepare for her statewide post — drew steady turnout from local Democrats at three polling locations. Party leaders quickly rallied behind Jones after polls closed Sunday.
“Mike Jones has shown through his work and leadership that he is deeply committed to serving Virginians and tackling the everyday challenges families face,” Democratic Party of Virginia Chair Lamont Bagby, a state senator from Henrico, said in a statement. 
Jones, he said, “brings a steady, solutions-focused approach to public service, and he understands what it takes to make life more affordable and strengthen our communities. Keeping our Democratic majority in the Senate is critical to continuing that progress, and I look forward to serving with him in the Senate.”
Jones currently represents House District 77. If he wins the Senate seat on Jan. 6., the victory will immediately trigger another special election to fill his House seat.
Sunday’s primary followed an unusually tense week in what had been a brief nomination contest. 
As reported by Virginia Scope on Thursday, the campaigns of Gardner and Jones — once close political allies who often described each other as friends — came to blows after Gardner released a TV and digital ad focused on past allegations involving Jones and a 2024 protective-order case that was later dismissed by a judge.
The ad displayed old news headlines and asserted, “Mike Jones’ history of alleged violence toward women is shocking, dangerous and disqualifying.” 
Jones criticized the ad in an interview with the outlet, saying Gardner left out the full context of the case’s resolution. 
“I am honestly saddened that a member of my own party, someone who I thought was a friend, who I’ve talked in confidence with about this situation, would use portions of it for her political gain,” Jones said. 
Gardner’s campaign declined to answer questions from Virginia Scope about whether she was aware of the judge’s decision dissolving the protective orders.
Jones, meanwhile, spent more than $100,000 on his own advertising, running spots on Richmond-area TV and radio stations focused on “lowering costs, school funding and housing affordability.”
Top Democratic officials lined up behind both candidates in the final days of the race.
Hashmi was among the first to endorse Jones last month, calling herself “proud” to support him. Richmond Mayor Danny Avula backed Jones on Thursday.
Gardner, a former deputy county administrator, received endorsements from Senate President Pro Tempore Louise Lucas, D-Portsmouth, and Sen. Aaron Rouse, D-Virginia Beach. 
The special election was scheduled after Hashmi’s victory in the November statewide contest created a vacancy that needed to be filled before lawmakers return to Richmond in mid-January. 
Redrawn in 2021, Senate District 15 is safely Democratic but geographically split between Richmond and Chesterfield, with strong pockets of organized voter turnout. Hashmi won the seat by a decisive margin in 2023.
Thomas, the Republican nominee, is familiar to voters after challenging Gardner in House District 76 last month, a race he lost by more than 37 percentage points. 
With the nomination settled, Jones now has less than a month to focus on the general election and consolidate Democratic support.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)An influential Democratic-Farmer-Labor official in northern Minnesota has roiled the party by declining to resign as chair of Congressional District 8 despite being charged with criminal vehicular homicide.
The incident has split Democrats between those who believe due process should play out for the accused and those who believe a personal scandal will derail the goals of beleaguered Democrats in northern Minnesota.
On the evening of July 3, 2024, police in Itasca County responded to a report of a person lying in a lane of Highway 169, near Nashwauk. They found the body of 19-year-old Carter Haithcock, who was pronounced dead at the scene.
The next morning, 8th District DFL Chair Cyndy Martin called 911 and said that she may have been involved in a collision near Nashwauk the night before, according to the criminal complaint.
Martin, who declined the Reformer’s request for comment, pleaded not guilty last month to a felony count of criminal vehicular homicide. Martin faces up to 10 years in prison. Martin’s attorney, David Valentini, also declined to comment.
Martin is one of the most influential DFL figures in northern Minnesota. In addition to chairing the 8th District party, she sits on the DFL’s Constitution, Bylaws and Rules Committee. She’s also a successful fundraiser and has connections with statewide elected officials.
Minnesota Democrats have largely refrained from publicly commenting on Martin’s case and whether she should remain in party leadership. Local congressional district parties aren’t controlled by the state party, but state officials could call on or press Martin to resign.
Multiple DFL elected officials in the Northland didn’t respond or declined the Reformer’s requests for comment about Martin.
Last month, DFL Chair Richard Carlbom was asked at a Democratic listening session why someone charged with vehicular manslaughter should remain in party leadership.
Carlbom, after an awkward pause, said “there is due process in this country, and I’m not about to, like, somehow — I don’t know, people sometimes think I can just, uh, well, I’m gonna allow due process to play out.”
Carlbom echoed those comments in a statement to the Reformer.
“This was a tragic loss of life, and my condolences go out to Carter’s family and everyone affected by this heartbreaking situation. Because this is an active legal case, we’re not going to prejudge the judicial process,” Carlbom said.
But pressure could be mounting for Martin to resign. Minneapolis citizen journalist Taylor Dahlin is tracking the case closely, and some party activists want her out.
A mysterious email
Lee Cutler served as the 8th District DFL vice chair under Martin until March of this year. Cutler said he was good friends with Martin, but he felt that she should have resigned back in November 2024 when she was criminally charged.
He says that shortly after prosecutors charged Martin, he and Martin together drafted an email to the DFL’s 8th District delegates saying Martin had already resigned. The email was sent out from the local party’s email account.
“Unfortunately, our friend and leader Cyndy Martin has stepped down as chair due to personal matters,” Cutler wrote in the email sent out on Nov. 23, 2024.
In the email, Cutler directed delegates to tell reporters if they’re contacted that Martin is no longer the chair and that he’s the acting chair.
About three hours later, another email from the local DFL party’s account — purportedly written by Cutler —  told the delegates: Never mind.
“Please disregard the previous email that I recently sent out. There was a misunderstanding, and Cyndy Martin has not resigned from her position as CD 8 Chair,” the email said.
Cutler says he didn’t write the second email, even though his name is in the signature of the message. He says the second email made its way up to DFL leadership, and he suspects someone in the party sent out the second email under his name.
The details of the emails were first reported by the Duluth Monitor.
In March, Northland politics came under a microscope after former Minnesota Sen. Justin Eichorn was charged with attempted coercion and enticement of a minor. Shortly after he was arrested, Eichorn resigned from the Senate under immense pressure from his Republican colleagues.
Cutler said that Martin’s charge and Eichorn’s scandal are obviously different, but he said that as with Eichorn, Martin’s charge is a distraction.
“It’s tragic what happened. I’ve always felt that as a leader within the DFL, our role was to uplift the party, its goals and the candidates — not ourselves,” Cutler said. “Party leaders are meant to support that work in the background, so the story should never be about us. In the 8th District, we need to focus on electing a candidate who represents our party’s values and this situation only serves as a distraction from that work. Fighting within the party is never a good thing.”
Minnesota v. Martin
Martin told law enforcement in July 2024 that on the night of the collision, she attended a dinner and was driving home after her dinner concluded at about 10:30 p.m., according to court documents. While driving through Nashwauk in Itasca County, she hit something with her car, she told officers.
“She believed she struck an owl or a turkey. (Martin) stated she did not stop, and continued home,” the complaint reads.
Martin was speaking to someone on the phone at the time she allegedly hit Haithcock, according to the complaint. The police interviewed the caller, who said that Martin exclaimed “Oh my God. I hit something,” according to the complaint. The caller told Martin to call 911. Martin later called the person back and said nothing was wrong with her vehicle — something only hit her windshield.
A photo of Martin’s car taken by State Patrol troopers at her Grand Rapids home on July 4, 2024. Screenshot from court documents.
State patrol officers interviewed Martin at her Grand Rapids home the morning of the collision. Outside they found her teal Chevy Tahoe; the windshield was cracked and a headlight was  broken, and there was a piece of black fabric stuck between the hood and the frame, according to court documents.
The troopers asked Martin if she was drinking or on medications, and Martin told them she had an opioid prescription for knee pain, and she took one pill earlier in the day. Throughout the interview, the troopers said Martin exhibited mood swings and was “distraught, crying and upset at times,” according to court documents. Because of her behavior, the troopers decided to do a DWI investigation. Martin tested negative for controlled substances, including opiates.
The state and Martin’s defense agree that Haithcock was wearing dark clothing and “engaged in risky behavior” by walking in the highway, the state wrote in court documents.
Although the collision occurred in July 2024, Martin wasn’t charged with vehicular homicide until four months later. Itasca County Attorney Jacob Fauchald declined to tell the Reformer why.
Under state law, “the driver of any motor vehicle involved in a collision shall immediately stop the vehicle at the scene of the collision, or as close to the scene as possible, and reasonably investigate what was struck.”
The prosecution argues that Martin gave conflicting information about what happened.. She told officers that she believed she hit a bird and didn’t stop, while surveillance footage from a nearby gas station showed her stopping there for about 25 seconds.
The state argues that a jury could find that Martin didn’t conduct a reasonable investigation after the collision and doubt her claim of believing she hit an animal.
“There is a stark difference between an adult male and an owl or a turkey,” the state wrote in court documents.
Martin’s defense relies on whether she conducted an adequate investigation of the collision since she believed she only hit a bird.
Haithcock was 19 at the time of his death and had a young son.
“His passion was helping people who were going through hard times. He was caring, genuine and was such a funny sweet boy who took care of everyone. Carter had a great sense of humor and could make anyone laugh and was always, ‘Just Chillin,’” his obituary reads.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/MG_8862-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

(Photo illustration by Dean Mitchell via Getty Images)Drive through any town in northern New Hampshire and you’ll see older adults everywhere — opening shops each morning, volunteering at church fairs and food banks, checking in on neighbors, or caring for grandchildren while parents are at work. Older adults are the backbone of rural New Hampshire. They preserve local traditions, sustain civic institutions, and keep the social networks of small towns functioning.
But beneath these visible strengths lies an urgent reality: Many rural older adults are struggling to access even the most basic health and social supports they need to stay healthy, safe, and connected. 
New Hampshire is now one of the oldest states in the country, with nearly 21% of residents age 65 or older. Rural counties have even higher concentrations. These communities rely on small health systems, local nonprofits, and volunteers — but these systems, especially in the North Country, are stretched to the breaking point. 
Demand is surging at the same time that Medicaid and Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits are being cut, insurance reimbursements do not keep pace with cost, there are workforce shortages, and service capacity lags behind. Appointments are scarce, waitlists are long, specialty care is limited, and transportation is unreliable or nonexistent.
This is not sustainable. And it will not improve unless the state begins listening to rural older adults and investing in the services they say they need most.
 Listening to the people most affected

As New Hampshire considers new funding models, federal waivers, and/or delivery-system reforms, one principle must guide every decision: Older adults must have a meaningful voice in shaping the programs designed to support them. Across the country, the most successful rural initiatives elevate local residents as partners — not passive recipients. 
New Hampshire’s rural older adults possess deep resilience, life skills and experience, and practical insight. Policymakers cannot afford to overlook their expertise. Without targeted investment, chronic illness will continue to erode the health of older adults and the stability of the rural communities that depend on them.
Chronic illness
For many rural older adults, chronic illness shapes daily life. Rates of heart disease, diabetes, COPD, arthritis, obesity, and dementia are significantly higher in rural areas nationwide. In New Hampshire, 53.9% of adults 65 and older live with four or more chronic conditions, and 44.4% of adults 75 and older report a disability. Managing these conditions requires consistent, coordinated care, yet distance, weather, limited home-care capacity, and primary-care shortages often make that impossible. Social drivers of health — including social isolation, food insecurity, and unsafe or unaffordable housing — further compound risk and escalate costs. Two approaches with especially strong evidence in rural settings that can address chronic illness are integrated primary care and community health workers.
A strong primary care system increases trust, improves outcomes, and reduces unnecessary emergency-department and inpatient use. It provides comprehensive, continuous, and coordinated care; reflects the population it serves; and connects patients to specialty care, behavioral health, and needed services.
Community health workers, or local residents trained to serve under the guidance of a primary care provider, help bridge the workforce gap, extend care into hard-to-reach areas, and support chronic-disease management. For every $1 invested, community health worker programs save an estimated $11 and reduce hospitalizations and non-emergency ER visits. This is precisely the kind of cost-effective, high-impact solution New Hampshire needs.
Prevent falls
Falls are one of the most preventable and costly threats to older adults. In 2022, New Hampshire recorded 272 fall-related deaths, 17,743 emergency-department visits, and more than $315 million in related costs. Evidence-based fall-prevention programs, home-safety assessments, physical therapy, and simple home modifications should be scaled immediately.
Support aging in place and improve chronic-care capacity
Most older adults want to remain in their homes and communities. Programs like Home and Community-Based Care and Choices for Independence help — but demand vastly exceeds workforce capacity. The state must strengthen and modernize these systems.
Additional proven models include:
PACE (Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly): Integrates medical, social, and long-term care for people 55 and older who meet nursing-home eligibility. PACE consistently reduces hospitalizations, emergency department visits, and admissions to long-term care — even for people with dementia.
Hospital at Home: Delivers hospital-level care — including IV therapy, daily clinical visits, and remote monitoring — directly in the home. Research in The New England Journal of Medicine shows it reduces complications, lowers costs, and shortens recovery time. For rural areas with limited beds and long travel distances, this model is a natural fit.
New Hampshire must also increase insurance reimbursement rates, develop housing for health care workers, expand mobile-health teams, and improve coordination between health care and community organizations. If approved, the state’s Rural Health Transformation Grant proposal could be pivotal in advancing many of these solutions.
Expand broadband infrastructure: Telehealth, mental-health visits, remote monitoring for chronic illness, virtual physical therapy, and Hospital at Home all depend on reliable broadband. Yet many rural towns still lack it. Broadband is not optional — it is core health infrastructure.
Reduce social isolation: In 2025, 25.5% of older adults in New Hampshire lived alone, with rural residents at highest risk. Loneliness increases depression, dementia, and mortality. Senior centers, library programs, congregate meals, volunteer networks, and Certified Community Behavioral Health Centers can help rebuild connection and address the mental health conditions associated with isolation and loneliness.
Ensure reliable transportation: Rural older adults face long travel distances, winter isolation, and limited public transit. Volunteer driver programs, demand-response transit, and community rideshare networks can help close these gaps.
Healthy older adults mean healthy rural communities
Investing in primary care, community health workers, fall prevention, chronic-disease management, home-based care, broadband, transportation, and social-connection programs is not simply compassionate policy — it is an economic and moral imperative. Older adults are not a financial burden. They are the heart of rural New Hampshire.
When older adults thrive, rural communities thrive. And when rural communities thrive, New Hampshire thrives.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/caregivingworkforce-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

Whitmer will succeed Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear in the role, as Beshear was elected as the chair of the association. 
“In Michigan, we’ve shown that staying focused on the kitchen table issues — like costs, jobs, and roads — is a winning strategy,” Whitmer said in a press release from her Fight Like Hell PAC. “We flipped counties that voted for Trump like Macomb, Bay, and Eaton because we showed up and focused on what Michiganders needed to get ahead. As Vice Chair of the DGA, I look forward to taking what we’ve learned in Michigan to races across the country and helping candidates win tough races.”
The Democratic Governors Association is a political organization focused on electing Democrats in gubernatorial elections nationwide, as well as providing support for sitting Democratic governors. 
“We’ve proven that when we show up and focus on what we can do to make people’s lives better, then we can win anywhere, even in the toughest places,” Whitmer said in a press release from the association following the election.
Whitmer’s term will include the 2026 election cycle, in which 36 gubernatorial seats are up for election — 18 currently held by Democrats, including Michigan, and 18 by Republicans. 
“We also know with all the chaos coming out of Washington, D.C., it’s never been more important to elect Democratic governors,” she added in a video posted to X. “I know the stakes are high, but I know we can meet the moment and win.”
Whitmer stepped away from the National Governors Association earlier this year over what her office said were concerns about a lack of bipartisanship in the organization. 
Other Democratic governors who left the organization, including Govs. Tim Walz of Minnesota and Laura Kelly of Kansas, reportedly did so due to what they perceived as a lack of pushback to the policies of the Trump administration.

Source images: Katie Moore/The Marshall Project; Getty Images; Circuit Court of Cole County; and U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.When Steven Caldwell-Bey wasn’t able to get a regular refill for his blood thinners, he began taking one pill a day instead of two to stretch them out. The problem, he said, is that it’s been difficult to get medical attention at Jefferson City Correctional Center because so many nurses have quit. 
Other men serving time there said they haven’t been able to get proper care for conditions ranging from diabetes to cancer.
The issues came to a head after a group of nurses walked out in protest of the working conditions in October.
The Marshall Project – St. Louis spoke to over 40 people who have worked or lived at the prison. They reported rampant problems, including going weeks without medication, a lack of medical attention in solitary confinement and monthslong waits to get treatment or follow-up appointments for serious issues. 
Former and current staff at the prison lay the blame on Centurion Health, a private company that was awarded a contract in 2021 worth over $1 billion to provide health care for incarcerated people in Missouri. The state had sought a company to provide primary and specialty health care, medications, personnel and supplies and coordinate hospitalizations, the request for proposal said.

But staffing problems began to worsen in recent months after some personnel concerns. Employees allege that Centurion forced them to work long hours and extra shifts, creating a dangerous environment for them and their patients. 
Dana Long was a nurse in the infirmary, where sometimes she said she was caring for more than 20 patients on her own when there should have been at least an additional nurse. That meant juggling tasks such as administering IV antibiotics, taking vitals, changing wound dressings, helping those who were incontinent and, when she had time, updating medical records. 
Patients were in danger, she said. 
Long is one of several nurses who quit in early October. More have left since then. 
A corrections employee who asked not to be named out of fear of retaliation said the situation has gotten to the point where it’s causing unrest because people are frustrated. Daaron Harris, who is incarcerated, said people are feeling helpless, which creates hostility among the men and toward staff.
Missouri Department of Corrections officials declined a request for an interview with Warden Kelly Morriss. Department spokeswoman Karen Pojmann acknowledged that several health care professionals left in a short period, adding that Centurion brought in staff from other prisons to fill the gaps when the departures happened. She also said there is a team that monitors medical services. 
Pojmann referred other questions about staffing to Centurion. Officials there did not respond to repeated requests for comment.
State Rep. Gregg Bush, a Democrat from Columbia with a career in nursing, said he was beyond troubled by the allegations. He said he supports a review by the Missouri Legislature of any contractor that may not be meeting expectations.
In its contract proposal, Centurion officials boasted that its “corporate leadership team invests heavily in recruiting and human resources management systems to ensure full staffing.” According to the company’s website, there were 19 vacancies in mid-November of this year. Those included openings for a director of nursing and registered nurses, as well as a medication technician and mental health staff.
Caylin Marriott, a medical scheduler who worked at the facility in 2024, said she begged Centurion officials for help. A nurse who worked there until October, who didn’t want to be named because she’s looking for a new job, said their calls for staffing support were ignored. 
Nurses would go in for a shift without knowing when they would be able to leave because the next person might not show up and there are strict rules about leaving patients unattended, she said. Others said they were fired when they refused to work extra shifts.
In a resignation letter, Marriott said there was a toxic environment and she couldn’t let her mental health suffer longer. Another nurse wrote in her resignation letter that she left because “basic medical care and human dignity were routinely compromised.”
To get medical attention, people in prison fill out a health services request form. Ariane Todd, who worked at the facility until January, said they were “months and months and months” behind on addressing the forms. Marriott said there were stacks that had not been reviewed. People in solitary confinement went even longer without medical attention because their slips didn’t get picked up there on a regular basis, she added.
The forms for those outside of solitary are collected during sick call, a designated time they can seek medical attention.
Nineteen incarcerated men who spoke to The Marshall Project – St. Louis reported problems accessing care because sick call was canceled for weeks at a time. Several incarcerated men and corrections employees at the prison pinpointed that it had been over a month since it was last held.
A Centurion employee who didn’t want to be named out of a fear of retaliation said she’s seen patients who didn’t get proper care for infections or receive their cancer medication. 
The men in prison acknowledged that medical staff were overwhelmed. Most said the nurses were well-qualified and some went out of their way to help, though a couple were unprofessional. 
Two dozen incarcerated men told The Marshall Project – St. Louis that they had a difficult time getting their medication. Joseph Wilson, 52, fears he could have an embolism because he has gone several days without his blood thinners. 
“I really go into a panic,” he said.
Wilson shared a journal entry dated Sept. 10 that read, “So I’ve been out of my Eliquis since 9/6/25. I have done all I’m supposed to on my end but they haven’t issued me my monthly dosage cards. My Leg has begun to swell again.” 
Others reported not being able to get insulin, blood pressure medication or inhalers for various breathing disorders. Several said it was a long battle to get medical items like orthopedic shoes. Two former staff members confirmed there was an issue getting medical shoes ordered for patients. 
Many of the men said they relied on their loved ones to call and put pressure on Centurion or the Missouri Department of Corrections. In a November email, Tammy Mogab pleaded for help for her brother, a detainee there who was not getting his insulin. 
“I am very aware of the critical shortage of healthcare workers at JCCC but the essential medical needs of residents continue,” Mogab wrote.
Adequate health care is a longstanding issue in many prisons, but Deandre Pointer, who has been incarcerated for over two decades, said he’s never seen it this bad. He said there have been days when he hasn’t gotten his insulin and his blood sugar has bottomed out. 
Many of the men, especially those with chronic ailments, said a lack of medical attention means they are left in physical pain. The conditions also take a mental toll. One man said he was scared his liver cancer was spreading, but he hasn’t gotten an appointment to be seen yet. Those with lengthy sentences said they worry about getting older in the prison, which houses more than 1,830 people. 
Douglas Maupin, 69, said he got sepsis when a bleeding ulcer turned into an infection. He was transferred to a local hospital for a time before returning to the infirmary.
“It’s crazy down here,” he said.  
At least 14 of the incarcerated men interviewed by The Marshall Project – St. Louis said they submitted complaints that didn’t go anywhere. Joe Becker filed grievances when his finger was injured in 2021. When those didn’t help, he filed a lawsuit in July 2023. Court records show he received at least a dozen denials. Becker is one of several men who have open lawsuits regarding medical care at Jefferson City Correctional Center. Other cases involve allegations about scabies treatment, dental care and a catheterization procedure. 
Eugene Burrell has filed five complaints in the past year or so. He has also written to the assistant warden and the Department of Justice seeking help getting orthopedic shoes, according to documents reviewed by The Marshall Project – St. Louis. In a grievance dated Oct. 24, he wrote: “JCCC Medical Dept. has canceled ‘sick call’ for several weeks this month citing ‘staff shortage.’ I’ve attended three weeks hoping to obtain health care & a follow-up appt. to no avail.” 
In another complaint, he wrote that the lack of health care access “equates to neglect on behalf of the Department.”
In February, Zachary Smith submitted a complaint saying he had not received refills for his thyroid medication. In a response five months later, a nurse wrote that she had “discovered that all items have been ordered and will be issued as soon as they arrive.”
Eugene Crider, 56, said he was diagnosed with Guillain-Barré syndrome, a neurological disorder that can be fatal, and has been in the infirmary for over a year. At first, there was an aide who helped him, he said, but she’s gone. Nurses give him medicine to help him sleep, but otherwise, he relies on prisoners who have jobs in the infirmary to help him with daily tasks such as getting dressed and eating, though there are restrictions on what they can do to help. 
Crider said he’s been “laying here, day in and day out.” He said he wanted to know if Centurion and the Department of Corrections officials were inept or just didn’t care.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Conservation groups across the West are raising concerns about Steve Pearce, a former New Mexico representative who is President Donald Trump’s newest nominee to lead the Bureau of Land Management.
The nomination has reignited a fight over the management of public lands which was highlighted during negotiations over Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” due to proposed amendments to sell off federal land. The fight also spawned two new bipartisan caucuses in Congress, both co-chaired by Montanans, and predicated on public land access and management.
In Nevada, the BLM manages nearly 48 million acres of federal land, about 67% of the state. Nationwide, the BLM oversees 245 million acres of federal land, along with 700 million acres of subsurface rights for extraction and energy development, putting the position directly in the crosshairs of energy developers and outdoor industry groups.
According to the Center for Western Priorities, Pearce amassed a “lengthy anti-public lands record,” sponsoring bills to shrink national monuments and increase extraction on national forest land.
Many conservation groups are specifically honing in on Pearce’s long record of advocating to sell off federal lands, including sponsoring legislation in Congress to authorize land sales or exchanges with local governments.
In a letter to then-House Speaker John Boehner in 2012, Pearce wrote that of the federal lands located in the West, “most of it we do not even need.”
He proposed using land sales to reduce the deficit, similar to rhetoric heard earlier when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum equated federal lands to the nation’s “balance sheet.”
“We cannot afford to hand the keys to 245 million acres of our public lands over to someone who has spent his career trying to auction them off to the highest bidder,” Aubrey Bertram, staff attorney and federal policy director at Wild Montana, said. “Steve Pearce’s record is crystal clear: he believes public lands should be privatized for billionaires’ benefit, not protected for the people’s.”
But Pearce’s nomination has been greeted with enthusiasm by mining and energy companies that operate on federal land, as well as by many Republican officials, including Montana Sen. Steve Daines.
“I knew Steve in the House days, and Steve is a great pick. And I particularly like the fact that it’s a Westerner,” Daines said in an interview. “I think it’s helpful when we have leaders in those important positions that come from the West, when they understand uniquely the challenges we face as it relates to federal land, state land, private land. And Steve Pearce has lived it and breathed it.”
Daines is a member of the newly formed Senate Stewardship Caucus, which is co-chaired by Montana Sen. Tim Sheehy.
The two Montanans also bucked their party earlier this year by joining Senate Democrats in a resolution that would have prevented the use of public land sales to reduce the deficit.
Pearce has roots in the oil and gas industry that stretch beyond his political work.
In the 1980s, Pearce founded an oilfield services company in New Mexico, which he later sold when he won his first election.
Starting in 2003, he represented New Mexico in Congress for seven terms.
He lost races for the U.S. Senate in 2008 and governor in 2018.
While conservation and public land advocates have pushed back against Pearce’s nomination, industry groups have applauded Trump’s pick.
The National Cattleman’s Beef Association said Pearce’s experience makes him “thoroughly qualified to lead the BLM and tackle the issues federal lands ranchers are facing.”
The Western Energy Alliance, comprising oil and gas companies across nine western states, also put out a statement of support for Pearce.
“As a westerner coming from a state that’s nearly 20 percent BLM land, he understands the bureau’s mission. As a former congressman and chair of the Congressional Western Caucus, his record shows he’s been a champion of multiple-uses of public lands. Steve has been a longtime friend who understands the value of energy development among other uses,” the Alliance said.

(Image by Lela Seiler, courtesy of CCS Early Learning)The Alaska Supreme Court has ruled that the state’s child support system has first priority when a foreclosed property is sold to pay multiple debts.
The court issued its opinion on Nov. 28, resolving a long-running lawsuit brought by Global Federal Credit Union (formerly Alaska USA) against the state and several other defendants.
“This is a pretty important case from my client’s perspective,” said Jonathan Clement, a senior assistant attorney general who represented Alaska’s child support system.
“This is the first time that a court has actually decided that child support gets priority over all other judgment lien holders, even liens recorded earlier, when there’s surplus funds at issue,” he said.
The case decided by the court involved property in Eagle River that was mortgaged by Wells Fargo. In 2017, Global levied a lien against the property for unpaid debt. Shortly afterward, the state’s child support division recorded another lien against the property for unpaid debt.
Typically, liens are repaid in chronological order: First filed, first paid.
In 2018, a law firm sold the property through foreclosure and paid off the remaining Wells Fargo mortgage. There was money left over, but not enough to pay both Global and the state.
The state protested the law firm’s plans to pay Global first, and the firm complied with a state order that required it to pay the state first. 
Global sued in state court, but a district court judge and a superior court judge each ruled against the credit union before it appealed to the supreme court.
Writing on behalf of the court, Justice Jude Pate concluded, “Our interpretation of (state law) provides an effective priority for CSSD liens over competing judgment liens.”
Alaska’s Child Support Services Division (CSSD) is now known as the Child Support Enforcement Division (CSCD).
That priority doesn’t put the state above a bank holding a mortgage or “deed of trust” but it does give the state priority over other liens on the property.
 “The important thing for this case is that it gives CSCD another tool where they can try to collect money that’s owed by the obligors,” Clement said.
“I would say of all the cases I’ve worked on, this is the one that will have the most impact in my career going forward,” he said.
An attorney representing Global declined comment on behalf of the credit union. 
In a footnote attached to the case, Pate wrote that the court’s ruling could cause people to behave differently during foreclosure auctions.
He suggested that if the Legislature disagrees with the court’s interpretation, it might want to pass a law clarifying two conflicting statutes interpreted by the court.
“If our interpretation is contrary to the legislature’s intent,” he wrote, “amendments to the relevant child support statutes could clarify the interaction between child support liens, other liens, and mortgages.”",https://alaskabeacon.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/unnamed-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 10:59:10.749814

(Submitted) TOPEKA — The newly formed American Honey Institute will offer the honey industry the same opportunities and advocacy that other commodities currently have, one of its founders said.
Gary LaGrange, CEO of Valor Honey, said on the Kansas Reflector podcast that industry-wide challenges need to be addressed. The low price of honey makes it difficult for small producers to compete with imported honey, much of which has had cheap sweeteners added to it, he said.
“We also discovered that the industry as a whole did not have the power as other commodities have, wheat and soybeans and corn and cattle, and it was a bit more ad hoc,” LaGrange said.
Four years ago at an National American Honey Producers meeting, discussions began about creating the institute to focus on educating people about the importance of bees and the honey industry; to create a certification process for honey; to promote beekeeping as a therapeutic activity to help veterans and others; and to advocate on a national level, LaGrange said.
Through Valor Honey and its work teaching soldiers beekeeping skills as a way to help them manage post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, LaGrange has seen beekeeping transform lives. But when veterans wanted to take their skills and compete in the honey market, they couldn’t, he said.


“They could sell small quantities, but to get into the commercial, industrial side was difficult to them because the price of honey was so low, they couldn’t compete with the honey that was being put on the market by packers,” LaGrange said.
Packers buy imported honey, he said.
In 2021 and 2022, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration tested 144 samples of imported honey, finding that about 10% were adulterated with sweeteners. LaGrange said more consistent testing and enforcement is needed so consumers know what they are buying.
Brian McCornack, Kansas State University professor and and head of the Department of Entomology, joined LaGrange on the podcast to talk about the honey institute, which he will lead. LaGrange said K-State offers research capabilities along with the ability to communicate through its networks to support educational outreach.
McCornack said beekeepers lose about 40% to 50% of honeybees annually, but last year, reported losses were upward of 70% to 80%.
“Those kinds of loss losses for a managed pollinator like honeybees are not sustainable,” he said. “At the center of this is really the U.S. beekeeper. They make most of their living, especially the larger producers, through pollination services. So they’re moving, literally trucking bees, around the U.S. to provide valuable services for a lot of the commodities that we find in our grocery stores and our shopping carts. When you have those kinds of losses, and one of your primary incomes is pollination services, staying alive in that industry becomes very challenging.”
The formation of an institute to combine research, education, workforce development, communication, and testing for authenticity and integrity of honey was a perfect fit for K-State, McCornack said.
“Our beekeepers are in peril as well,” he said. “It’s not just about the bees. It’s making sure that beekeepers can thrive, and making sure that they’ve got a market that is fair.”
Valor Honey and K-State are joined by the American Beekeeping Federation and the American Honey Producers as partners in the institute.
“The two largest beekeeping orgs in the U.S. coming together on this particular topic, to me, is what really keeps me inspired on a daily basis,” McCornack said. “If everybody has an important message and sings their song the loudest, and they’re not singing from the same sheet of music, as Gary often says, then it’s really hard to know what to really focus on.”
Bringing the primary organizations together to discuss the issues will help the industry create a plan and find solutions, McCornack said.
LaGrange said the honey industry has flown under the radar, often because people don’t understand the importance of pollination.
“Most people think that honey comes out of a hive or two in the backyard, and they just don’t understand the industry,” he said. “They don’t understand the importance of bees and pollination. Without them, we would be paying a whole lot more for fruits and vegetables and other commodity crops that they pollinate. Honey is really tertiary in that process.”
LaGrange, 83, spent 28 years in the Army and served three tours in Vietname. Since founding Valor Honey, he’s made it his life to support veterans and others who need help through teaching them about beekeeping. Founding the American Honey Institute is the next step in helping soldiers.

“To help these young men and women find find their way, to keep them from suicide, to get them out of this post traumatic stress syndrome, and get them out of these other issues that come with war — it’s so important to see that happen on a recurring basis with those we work with,” LaGrange said. “It’s just a wonderful thing. What good does it do if they can’t get into the industry that’s profitable, if they can’t find work that’s profitable? So it all ties together, and that’s why we intend for all of the functions of this institute to get as much as possible under one roof.”
Packers, consumers and others involved in the industry are part of the solution, he said.
McCornack said answers won’t be easy to find. There are no standards for honey currently, a process needs to be worked out for testing and even determining the definition of honey, and all of the work needs to be research-based.
“There are politics involved in the changes that need to be made,” he said. “Anytime you bring up the word ‘regulation’ or policy or law, I think that gets people nervous, and that can be expected.”
McCornack said the institute will maintain its focus on the goals of stabilizing the industry for beekeepers and for consumers, who should know what is in the honey they’re buying.
“I hear this from Gary a lot — honeybees are the canary in the coal mine,” McCornack said. “It’s just whether or not we’re willing to listen. And they’re telling us a lot here these last couple years, this last year in particular.”
LaGrange and McCornack easily list stresses on the bee population, from mites to lack of floral resources to chemicals.
As they tackle those problems, both men keep at the forefront the work being done with veterans and others.
“The fact that working with honeybees has the merit of being able to save a life, that’s very special,” LaGrange said. “With all these young men and women whose lives we have helped, we’re making more than a marginal contribution to the problem we have in this country with suicides today, particularly among veterans and now others, maybe farmers and first responders. That’s pretty special.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Beekeeping4-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

Members of the Van Gilder family, which owns the land under consideration for the rezoning and runs a community Facebook page for the project, said on social media Sunday that it pulled the request, upholding their responsibility to be good stewards of the land.
“That responsibility matters deeply to us and while we believe we put forth the best proposal, we also heard from many of you that more study was needed,” the family said on Facebook. “As a result, we believe the right thing to do now is to honor the current moratorium, which will give the township and its residents the time needed to develop thoughtful, well-considered regulations for any future data centers.”
The Howell Township Board of Trustees planned to hear the request tonight at its Monday meeting.

Howell Township is one of a growing number of communities in Michigan raising questions on how they will be impacted if one of these facilities is built within their community as a project reportedly backed by Meta, the parent company for Facebook and Instagram, is planned on more than 1,000 acres of farmland.
Breanne Green, with Stop the Data Centers Livingston County, a leader in the movement to prevent data centers from flourishing, said the withdrawal of the request was a tactical victory but was not a final decision.
“The community will continue to show up, and we expect the Township to protect residents and uphold the master plan. We’re not backing down,” Green said in a statement. “Residents spoke up, that’s what made a difference. But it’s also clear the developer plans to return as soon as they believe they have influenced the process or changed the board’s mind. This is far from over.”
Howell Township Board Trustee Bob Wilson also confirmed that the rezoning application will no longer be before the board on Monday evening. Wilson told Howell-based WHMI-FM that the board received an email about the withdrawn application.
Jonathan Hohenstein, the township board’s treasurer, also told the station that the application was on hold as the township and board worked on regulations for data centers.
“We will still be having a meeting to address the definition of data processing and to allow the public to speak should they still wish,” Hohenstein wrote to the station.

,Mississippi Today,2025-12-08 14:40:00+00:00,Mississippi Today,Mississippi State rolled out changes to campus parking. Some students say they can’t afford it,Candice Wilder,,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/12/08/mississippi-state-campus-parking/,Recent changes to campus parking at Mississippi State University are unexpected expenses some students struggle to pay.,"STARKVILLE — Since transferring to Mississippi State University from Itawamba Community College in 2022, the cost of parking on campus has always been an issue for Madeline Comer. 
Last spring, Comer got a $50 parking ticket because her license plates weren’t registered properly with the university’s parking services, she said. Comer, a junior studying graphic design, called to dispute the ticket. 
For weeks, she couldn’t reach anyone on staff, she said. Two weeks after the first ticket, she received another $50 ticket for the same issue. She was afraid of racking up other parking citations that might result in progressively higher fines and a “boot” or wheel clamp. 
The citations would have strained her monthly budget as she juggles rent, art supplies for classes, groceries and other bills. 
After weeks of back and forth, parking services dropped the ticket. Comer felt relieved.
Then in July, university officials announced a major parking overhaul that included restructuring campus zones, revamping prices and implementing new tier systems to purchase parking permits. 
Comer knew parking fees would be even more of a problem. But she lucked up. 
She bought a $225 annual commuter parking permit after waiting nearly four hours in an online lottery to apply for her pass, unlike many of her peers, who ended up on a lottery waitlist or getting a pricier permit outside of their desired spot. The annual parking permits can cost up to $650.

Her parking spot is in G3, a lot near Humphrey Coliseum, where the Bulldogs’ basketball teams play. But Comer’s parking spot is nowhere near the majority of her classes in Hunter Hall. She lives 15 minutes from campus, outside of Starkville, and commutes four times a week. 
Weekly costs for gas are now adding up, Comer said.
“It’s just a lot for my bank account to handle,” she said. “Not to mention the rent, groceries and art supplies I also pay for out of pocket.” 
Comer, who is paying for college on her own, works multiple part-time jobs. She is a house cleaner for Airbnb, a barista at a coffee shop and has taken on multiple side hustles as a freelancer, selling her art and designs online. 
Covering unexpected college costs
Mississippi undergraduates leave university with an average of $29,000 of federal loan debt, according to a 2021 report from the Institute of College Access & Success.
The rising cost of in-state tuition over the past few decades, along with additional costs of campus meal plans, textbooks and class supplies, laboratory fees, transportation and off-campus housing have made attending university expensive.

At Mississippi State, tuition has increased slightly in each of the past four years, including a nearly 4% rise from $9,815 in 2023-2024 to $10,202 in 2024-2025 academic year, according to data from the National Center for Education Statistics. 
On-campus housing starts at $8,456, and meal plans are $5,808 a year — a total of $24,000 for a full academic year. For out-of-state students, costs can soar up to $42,000 a year. 
While the cost for books and supplies have steadied over the past year, the cost of food and housing for students living on and off campus has steadily increased year to year. Data from NCES shows nearly a 5% increase in food and housing expenses and a 4% increase in other expenses between 2023-2025. 
Mississippi State officials said its new parking system allows students to pay less for a permit with guaranteed space, while other universities in the state do the opposite.
“The inherent value of our permit is significantly higher than that of our peers,” Sid Salter, a university spokesman, said in an email.
By comparison, parking permits at the University of Southern Mississippi are $167 for students and $414 for reserved spaces, according to the university’s parking and transit services website. At the University of Mississippi, parking permits for students are $395 for the 2025-2026 academic year. 
But for some students at Mississippi State, the price change for campus parking is just another cost to their already lean budgets.
Kenneth McGowan, senior studying computer engineering, said college students can quickly tally hundreds or up to $1,000 a semester in unexpected expenses. He felt blindsided by the price changes to parking, tuition and dining plans upon returning to campus this semester. He said he had to come up with more than $3,000 extra to get through the year.
McGowan isn’t alone. Nationwide, students reported some level of surprise with the full cost of attending college, including but not limited to tuition and other directly billable expenses, according to survey results from Inside Higher Ed’s Student Voice report. At least a quarter of students have trouble budgeting as a result, according to the report. 
In another set of findings in Inside Higher Ed’s report, 36% of students said an unexpected expense of $1,000, or even less, could threaten their ability to stay enrolled. Another 22% said the same of an expense between $1,001 and $2,500. 
The College Board estimates that indirect expenses can make up 40%–50% of the annual cost for undergraduates. The average full-time undergraduate spends $1,240 per year on books and supplies, according to the College Board report. An estimated 91% of American colleges fail to tell students the full cost of their college education, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office. 
To make up for extra college related expenses, McGowan spends his free time with gigs including food pickup and delivery for GrubHub, UberEats and Door Dash. He also picked up another job as a FANgineer, working for catering and event services during Mississippi State football games. 
“The whole thing, it’s just kind of frustrating,” McGowan said of unexpected expenses. 
McGowan said he bought a $225 parking pass for the year. It was another hit in his budget, but he considers himself lucky. He parks his car near Sanderson Center, the student recreation hub, which is near the heart of campus. His engineering classes in McCain Hall are another 10-15 minute walk across campus.

Eli Rowell, a senior studying graphic design, paid $650 for a North Garage parking permit. He was shut out of the lottery process once the university ran out of his preferred parking lot spot: G3, near Howell Hall. 
Rowell works part time as a bartender at Harvey’s restaurant in Starkville to pay for college. He received a scholarship when he transferred from Hinds Community College, but he is paying out of pocket for his next three semesters.
Mississippi State does a “decent job” of breaking down costs for attending the university, Roswell said. But research and transparency from university scholarship and financial aid offices are just as important, he said. 
“Education should be accessible to more people,” Rowell said. “Understanding where your money is going is important. The more information you have about costs, the better you are able to navigate your college experience.” 
McGowan said he wishes the university would be more transparent about price changes. He said he doesn’t know anyone in his friend group who had to pay less due to the changes made at Mississippi State. 
“I just don’t understand the reason or purpose behind it,” McGowan said of increased costs. “MSU used to be affordable.” 
Mississippi State officials said they’ve worked to modernize and improve the parking system to accommodate population growth and changing campus infrastructure. The changes were also to reduce heavy traffic, enhance pedestrian and cyclist safety, and increase usage of existing parking spaces. 
“The plan has worked as it was designed to work,” Salter said. 
This year, MSU sold parking permits on a tiered system, with different prices assigned to parking zones based on proximity to campus and desirability. The most convenient spots at the heart of campus, aside from North Garage, cost $375 for residents and $275 for commuters. Permits for North Garage, located at the center of campus, cost $650.

For commuters, parking breaks down into four tiers, with the lowest level costing $100 to park on the outskirts of campus. Resident parking breaks down into three tiers, with the lowest level costing $150. 
Mississippi State officials were aware of the criticism from students, faculty and residents, including several petitions calling for the resignation of Jeremiah Dumas, executive director of parking services. 
“Parking is a hot-button topic, so such unfair criticism is neither unexpected nor unusual,” Salter said. “The university will continue to work and adjust as necessary to fix issues, but there are none we plan to address. Things are functioning smoothly.”  
It is unclear how much the university profits off of campus parking, but the revenue is used to cover the cost of parking operations, which is more than $2 million, Salter said. It costs an average of $5 million a year to maintain the parking lots and roads on campus, Salter said. 
‘Spending every penny’ to pay for college
Mississippi State offers resources for students who need short-term loans, food security resources, temporary housing assistance and access to devices such as laptops. The university also helps students find on-campus and part-time employment. 
When Comer moved to Starkville, she opted to not buy a parking pass. It was expensive. To save money, she walked 40 minutes from her apartment to classes, trudging along with her portfolio and art supplies. 
“It wasn’t much  fun in the heat and heavy rain. But I made it work,” Comer said. 
She tried taking public transportation, but a bad experience left her not wanting to ride the bus. During Comer’s first year, she was dropped off at a random location on campus and had to find her way back on her own. 
She worked multiple shifts waitressing at a local sports bar to save up for a car.  
Comer doesn’t want to slam her university; she enjoys attending Mississippi State. But she said as someone who is “spending every penny” to put herself through college, speaking up on behalf of other students can make a difference for future students. 
“Parking may seem small to some people,” Comer said, “but it’s just these little costs that make it really hard and often feel like, if you don’t have money, college isn’t for you.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/19120758/3X0A2039.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

(File photo by Getty Images)The Medical University of South Carolina’s hospital system is asking legislators for $350 million for its planned new cancer hospital.
The hospital’s governing board in April approved plans for a top-tier cancer center in downtown Charleston, next to Rutledge Tower on MUSC’s campus.
At the time, MUSC Health did not say how much the hospital would cost. Now it’s turning to the General Assembly in hopes of getting taxpayer dollars to cover the bill instead of taking on debt to build it.
The ask comes as MUSC chases a Comprehensive Cancer Center designation from the National Cancer Institute.
If approved, the center would be the first of its kind in South Carolina. Patients seeking this top level of care currently must travel out of state to centers in North Carolina, Georgia and Tennessee.
The state-owned hospital system’s cancer hospital holds a tier-two designation as a Clinical Cancer Center. The bump in rankings could mean a bump in National Cancer Institute research grant support — as much as $14 million over five years compared to the $11 million, five-year grant it holds now.
“This investment is crucial for South Carolina, as it facilitates the development of lifesaving treatments, attracts top-tier scientists and jobs, and advances innovations to reduce the state’s cancer burden and mortality rates,” the budget application reads.
The hospital system anticipates a “strong” return on the investment but did not provide further details in its application.
South Carolina is below the national rate in terms of number of cancer cases, according to National Cancer Institute data, but the state has a higher mortality rate from the deadly disease.
There are 57 Comprehensive Cancer Centers in the country. MUSC would apply for its designation in 2028 and the center would open in 2030.
To reach the next level, the cancer center must increase the depth and breadth of its research and broaden its community reach.
The Legislature set aside $5 million worth of recurring payments in the current budget to help pay for the designation effort. That’s on top of $10 million in recurring payments, which the hospital system has received annually since 2022.
SC-owned hospital system set to double debt with 2 new hospitals

The existing center already boasts more than 230 researchers with a more than $50 million portfolio and more than 200 clinical trials, according to the hospital system’s budget application
When MUSC announced the new center, hospital leadership said it would likely have 50 to 100 beds for inpatient treatment but will also house outpatient care. Services will include surgeries, stem cell transplantation, dedicated CT and MRI scanners, chemotherapy and radiation, a lab and pharmacy, as well as pain management and rehab.
In addition to the new center on the peninsula, MUSC is standing up clinics around the state. The hospital system broke ground in September on a clinic in Summerville and it has announced plans for a similar facility in Florence. Leadership also has suggested Orangeburg as a possible clinic location.
Doctors diagnose an average of 780 people with cancer each year in Florence County, according to data from the state Department of Public Health. In Orangeburg County, that number is 519, with breast, prostate and lung cancers being the most common.
MUSC has been on an expansion spree the last several years.
In 2019, the hospital system purchased four rural community hospitals in Florence, Marion, Chester and Lancaster counties and, with the latter two, saw firsthand the growth potential in communities near the North Carolina state line.
In 2021, it again expanded with the purchase of three hospitals and a standalone emergency room in the Midlands. And in 2023, it took over operations of Orangeburg’s hospital.
MUSC Health weighing deal for control of struggling Grand Strand hospitals

A five-member state financial review panel gave the hospital system permission in April to borrow $860 million: $400 million to build a hospital in Summerville’s mega Nexton community, $330 million to build a hospital in Indian Land (the unincorporated panhandle of Lancaster County), and $130 million to finance the equipment for both.
And in September MUSC and Tidelands Health were still finalizing a deal for the state-owned system to take a controlling interest in the Grand Strand area hospitals. Financial details of that deal have yet to be made public.
All of that is on top of a planned purchase by MUSC of Roper St. Francis’ hospital on the peninsula.
The price of that deal will be decided in 2029, when Roper is scheduled to move to a new North Charleston location. In 2022, the Legislature set aside $15 million to help MUSC buy Roper’s to-be-vacated property.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/lung-cancer-concept-1024x666.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

Maynard says the administration is not moving quickly enough to inform the public about dire revenue forecast[...]","EPISODE INFO

HOST: Jennifer Smith
GUEST: Greg Maynard, the Boston Policy Institute







AMERICA MIGHT RUN on Dunkin’, but Boston runs on property taxes. Some 70 percent of the city’s $4.8 billion operating budget depends on levies from residential and commercial properties, which means pandemic-era shifts in work patterns have pushed the burden away from the downtown towers and toward homeowners. 
While this broader workplace and commercial value change is not Mayor Michelle Wu’s doing, her critics argue that a second consecutive double-digit residential tax hike should not be used to ramp up pressure on a struggling commercial sector. Beyond that, they say, the city sat on its potential 2026 tax rate numbers until late in the year when lawmakers were out of formal session.  
Wu announced last week that the city expected residential property taxes to rise 13 percent while the commercial sector could expect an average 4.4. percent drop next year. Since the Boston City Council must vote on Wednesday to approve the new tax rates, she coupled the announcement with a plea for lawmakers and business groups to back Boston’s plan, withering on Beacon Hill, that would shift the property tax burden away from residents and cap the annual increase at 9 percent. 
While these numbers are “surprising today,” the process of releasing the valuations so late in the year highlights a “mismatch between how much information City Hall has and how much information everyone else in this conversation has,” said Greg Maynard, executive director of the Boston Policy Institute, on The Codcast. 
“These are numbers that the city has had all year long. These are numbers that the city has been using all year long. These numbers are used to create the budget that was passed back in June,” said Maynard, whose think tank has a prickly history with Wu. He joined CommonWealth Beacon reporter Jennifer Smith to discuss the tax hike rollout. 
The mayor is currently trading shots with state Sen. Nick Collins of South Boston, who made similar claims about Wu’s timeline in releasing estimates.  
According to WBUR, Wu slammed any “accusations” that her administration withheld or obfuscated the numbers, saying elected officials’ “first responsibility” is to be “honest with our constituents.” 
Last year, Wu’s home rule petition to shift the tax burden toward commercial properties over a three-year period crashed and burned on Beacon Hill, with no hearing in the state Senate and the chamber’s leadership notably cool on the proposal. 
Business leaders, who initially agreed to the home rule’s language as a compromise, justified withdrawing support because of a discrepancy between Boston’s alarming estimates in the fall on the looming residential tax hike and the ultimate certified numbers. In a press briefing last week, administration officials noted that they were very confident about the accuracy of their assessments this year and released a letter announcing the numbers were certified on Friday. 
Maynard called the last-minute push a deliberate move from the city. “This is an issue that’s been warned about for years,” he said of the declining commercial values and their impact on city budgets. “The kinds of questions about, ‘How should Boston respond to this?’ is a conversation that can be had over a long period of time, and it’s a choice that’s been made by this city council, by this mayoral administration, to not have it over a longer period of time — to concentrate it, to manufacture this crisis.” 
On the episode, Maynard discusses the foundation of the property assessments (2:20), how the Wu administration has responded to the commercial downturn (7:00), and the prospects for a third try at the home rule tax shift (20:15).",https://i0.wp.com/commonwealthbeacon.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/The-Codcast_Wide-Banner.png?fit=1024%2C576&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — A Nebraska lawmaker two times was denied entry to the controversial state-run federal immigration detention facility that federal officials dubbed the “Cornhusker Clink” —  and now is calling on the Legislature’s Executive Committee to step in.
State Sen. Machaela Cavanaugh of Omaha said Monday that she made the four-hour trip to McCook in mid-November to check out the conditions of the place where migrant detainees of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement are held pending deportation.

She argues that the Nebraska Department of Correctional Services violated state law by not allowing her into the converted Work Ethic Camp, and cites a state statute that says Nebraska legislators are entitled to visit any state correctional facility “at any time.”
When Gov. Jim Pillen and Corrections Director Rob Jeffreys announced the agreement with the federal government, Cavanaugh said, they stated that the department would manage the property and it would continue to be considered a state facility.
“The denial of physical entry to a sitting senator is not only unprecedented — it is the latest escalation in a broader pattern of obstruction that undermines the Legislature’s statutory and constitutional oversight obligations,” Cavanaugh said.
The Omaha senator said she routinely conducts unannounced visits to state-run 24-hour facilities “because direct oversight is not optional — it is a core responsibility of my job.”
She said she specifically wanted to visit the McCook ICE detention center, because it involved “people being held in Nebraska without criminal charges and, in many cases, without clear legal recourse.” The immigration court and deportation process is separate from state courts, and immigrants held by ICE often face civil versus criminal charges.
“When the state deprives someone of their liberty, the conditions of that confinement must be subject to full public and legislative scrutiny,” she told the Nebraska Examiner. “There is no scrutiny. There is no carve-out in Nebraska law for secrecy just because ICE is involved.”
Neither the Corrections Department nor the Governor’s Office had immediate comment. 
Cavanaugh documented her efforts to gain entry to the former WEC in a letter to State Sen. Ben Hansen, chair of the Legislature’s Executive Board, and Sen. Myron Dorn, chair of the Legislative Oversight Committee. 
She also chronicled five prior legislative attempts to obtain information about the project, describing a pattern of “limited transparency and restricted information.”
Email between Cavanaugh and Jeffries and a person she described as a warden at the McCook facility offers details of the rejected visits on Nov. 12-13.
According to the email exchange: 
Cavanaugh arrived at the facility around 4:20 p.m. Nov. 12, and apparently spoke to Jeffries via the warden’s cell phone around 4:30 p.m., who told her she had failed to provide notice of her visit. 
Said Jeffries: “You were instructed that no person could arrive unannounced and be given immediate entry to a Nebraska correctional facility or a federal detention center.”
Cavanaugh, in an email around 10 p.m. that night of Nov. 12, emailed the warden and Jeffries that she would be returning to the facility the next morning.
“Though statute 83-186 (attached) does require me to provide notice, I am giving you this notice per my conversation with Director Jeffries on Warden Sommer’s cell phone at approximately 4:30 p.m. today, when Director Jeffries informed me that I had failed to provide notice of my visit.”
Jeffries later wrote to Cavanaugh to “clarify the legal position” of the department as to why she was not allowed to enter. 
“It is the fundamental nature of corrections, safety protocols and operations, and consistent with Nebraska law, that unannounced visitors of any type cannot be accommodated.”
He said her communication alerting them that she’d be there again Nov. 13 was “short notice” and “again a problem.”
Of Cavanaugh’s legal justification for her visit, Jeffries said in email that his team “worked to analyze your request, get legal advice and collaborate with our federal partners.”
“We have come to the determination that you will not be allowed to enter the WEC until you have complied with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement protocols related to detention center visits and provided sufficient notice to allow for the safe conduct of a visit.”
He also said that statute 83-186 “does not displace protocols for the security and safety of corrections facilities.” He said his team read that statute “in harmony with the statutory scheme of which it is a part.”
Cavanaugh, in the letter to Hansen and Dorn, said she reviewed the state’s contract with ICE and believes it provides that any “provision of this agreement contrary to applicable statutes … is null and void and shall not necessarily affect the balance of the agreement.”
“This means that the right of access provided in 83-186 invalidates any interpretation that members of the Legislature may be prohibited from accessing the facility.”
Cavanaugh said the documented history demonstrates that legislative leaders “have repeatedly sought access to accurate, timely information” on the project and its implications. 
She said the Executive Board oversees all legislative services and employees and hears matters of “general import to the Legislature and its operations as a whole.”She said Jeffreys actions were a “direct disregard” of the Legislature and its constitutional authority.
“I urge you … to act to defend the authority of the legislative branch. Such action is necessary to ensure we can effectively represent our constituents and the people of Nebraska.”

The California Highway Patrol graduated 780 new officers this year, including more than 130 cadets on Friday, underscoring the success of the agency’s recruitment push during a once-concerning vacancy rate.
Grappling with vacancies that ballooned 94% between 2015 and 2023, the agency in 2022 asked for $2 million from the state Legislature to hire more officers and launched a recruitment campaign known as the CHP 1000. In recent years, it also received some of its highest pay raises for officers, securing a 7.9% wage increase in 2023 and a $489-million, three-year labor contract in 2024.
Since those efforts kicked off, the agency hired more than 2,300 officers from 2022 and is on track to increase hiring by more than 60%, reports The Sacramento Bee. Applications also jumped by 52% — from more than 16,000 in 2022 to nearly 25,480 in 2024, according to the agency. This year, the CHP is on track to receive more than 33,000 applications.

Gov. Gavin Newsom, in a statement: “As we close out the year, California continues to make real progress — strengthening protections across the state while staying focused on the needs of the people we serve.”

The hiring surge comes as the governor is deploying CHP “crime suppression” teams in six California regions, following similar state intervention efforts in 2024 in Oakland, Bakersfield and San Bernardino. 
Though Newsom denied the teams were expanded in response to what the Trump administration called a crime crackdown in Democratic-led cities, enforcement activity from San Francisco police has reportedly ramped up due to potential threats of federal intervention.

Debating CA’s AI data centers

Artificial intelligence proponents and skeptics of the technology’s promised benefits clashed over how California should approach AI data centers at a recent CalMatters’ event moderated by reporter Alejandro Lazo.
The Nov. 18 panel discussion included Liang Min, the managing director of Stanford University’s Bits & Watts Initiative, who said that forecasting the state’s electricity demand is difficult because since new AI apps roll out quickly. He argued that as AI puts more demands on the grid, the state will need to rely on other sources of power, such as nuclear, geothermal or natural-gas energy.
The explosive growth of data centers are also raising environmental concerns, as well as concerns from utility watchdogs that Californians may end up footing the bill for billions of dollars in grid upgrades. But AI supporters say overregulation could stifle competition in the state.

Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group: “It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states.”

One politician’s fight against pollution

Before voters elected her to the San Diego County Board of Supervisors in July, Paloma Aguirre spent two decades trying to mitigate Tijuana River’s sewage contamination, writes CalMatters’ Deborah Brennan. 
Considered by Aguirre to be one of the worst environmental crises in the country, Tijuana River pollution dates to at least the 1930s. As the population grew in the border Mexican city, its waste exceeded what cross-border sewage plants could handle. In the early 2000s, sewage spills and beach closures along the southern San Diego coast became common. Contamination in the ocean leaves swimmers with illnesses, and toxic gas emissions near the river give residents headaches and nausea.
As the former mayor of Imperial Beach, Aguirre urged California and the federal government to declare a state of emergency over the pollution problem and lobbied to classify the area as a Superfund site. Once she became a county supervisor, she led plans to study the health effects of the pollution, and requested $50 million from the state to help ease the problem in a particularly contaminated area known as the Saturn Boulevard hot spot.

Aguirre: “The river is carrying dangerous chemicals, pollutants, pathogens and toxic gases that are impacting South San Diego communities.”

In a year of profound shifts at the federal level, uncertainty has been the name of the game across the United States. Nowhere is that truer than in the California water world.
Over many decades, the state has forged a symbiotic relationship with federal agencies to manage its notoriously complex — and aging — water system. The state has worked with an alphabet soup of federal agencies to manage some of the worst floods and droughts the state has ever seen. 
Research and technical expertise undergird all water-related activity in California, whether you’re a farmer applying water to your crops, a utility providing clean drinking water to your customers or a municipality trying to protect your community from floods. 
Fortunately the state is blessed with top-notch water experts, hailing from state and federal agencies, universities, consulting firms and nongovernmental organizations. They’re responsible for many of the tools the state uses to manage its water. Any California water action relies on decades of applied research and experienced people to implement it.
Changes at the federal level have put this tight state-federal partnership in doubt. 
The dust has yet to settle on the cuts — including the impact of the recent shutdown — but the effects are already being felt, just as storm season gets underway in California. These cuts already are impacting flood forecasting and emergency response. 
The California-Nevada River Forecast Center is reducing the frequency of its flood predictions. And staff reductions of emergency responders and at regional National Weather Service offices mean fewer people will respond to extreme weather events, which puts Californians at risk. 
The loss of institutional expertise is harder to quantify, though it’s vital to managing droughts and floods, protecting human health and restoring ecosystems.
The state must keep water flowing for the wellbeing of California’s residents, economy, and ecosystems. It’s equally important to be ready for droughts, floods, fires and other natural hazards.
Fortunately, in recent years, Californians have come together to find pragmatic solutions to water problems. 
Voters have shown they are all in on water, with most passing bond measures that fund crucial work. Partnerships once considered impossible — between agriculture and environmentalists, or cities and farms — are becoming the gold standard in this state. 
Research is helping us use scarce water wisely.
In a recent report, we at the Public Policy Institute of California make recommendations for where research dollars should go. We need to keep better track of our water, find new ways of funding big projects and develop new tools for the new problems we’re facing.
“California’s farms, communities, and ecosystems would all benefit from more accurate and timely systems to track how rain and snowmelt move through soils, vegetation, groundwater, rivers, and wetlands,” the study says.
“Just as important are improved tools to monitor and measure water use — across agriculture, cities, and the environment — so that managers can respond quickly and effectively to changing conditions. Without these systems, water planning, management, and emergency services are all hamstrung.”
The challenges confronting California water are not going away. The state will need to step up to fund and maintain the technical expertise needed to manage our water systems.
Now is the time to double down on research. The governor, the Legislature and researchers can work collectively by setting priorities, allocating funds and collaborating with other western states.

In San Jose, supporters see jobs and investment, while a key ratepayer advocate worries customers could end up paying for upgrades.","In summary
Artificial intelligence and its growing demand for data centers are putting new pressure on California’s electric grid. In San Jose, supporters see jobs and investment, while a key ratepayer advocate worries customers could end up paying for upgrades. 


San Jose, the symbolic capital of Silicon Valley, is now ground zero in California’s battle over how to govern the rise of data centers used to power artificial intelligence.
The county seat of Santa Clara is touting its partnership with Pacific Gas & Electric, claiming the city is “the West Coast’s premier destination for data center development.” The investor-owned utility now estimates it has enough capacity in its planning pipeline to push the city’s electricity use to almost three times its current peak.
Those plans are forcing major grid upgrades, PG&E and city officials say, while raising questions about who pays for them and whether the state can keep the power clean.
Panelists at a CalMatters event in downtown San Jose clashed over key issues. They included a local official working with PG&E on the city’s data-center buildout, a tech advocate urging California to seize the economic moment, a Stanford energy expert pressing for a more modernized grid and a utility watchdog skeptical of AI’s promised benefits.
Their discussion centered on how quickly California should move to accommodate new demand, what information the public should be entitled to and how to keep customers from shouldering the cost of infrastructure that may never be fully used.
Proposals to more strictly regulate data center development died in the Legislature this year. Going forward, several state agencies and commissions are expected to take up further discussions, including the California Energy Commission, the Little Hoover Commission and the California Public Utilities Commission.


How much energy will California’s new data centers actually need?
The surge in AI is complicating efforts by regulators and utilities to forecast how quickly data centers will grow and how much power they’ll need. Companies can propose large facilities without committing to build them, the computing demands behind AI are changing quickly and cooling needs vary across the state. These factors make long-term energy needs hard to pin down.
According to the state’s electricity-demand forecast, utilities report that data centers, in planning documents, have requested 18.7 gigawatts of service capacity. That’s enough to power roughly 18 million homes, compared with California’s estimated 14 to 15 million. Regulators don’t expect all of those projects to be built, and assume the ones that do will come online gradually and operate at less than their requested capacity, producing a forecast of between 4 and 6 gigawatts by 2040.
Liang Min, who directs Stanford’s Bits & Watts Initiative, and a speaker on CalMatters’ panel, said that forecasting is particularly tough because companies are rolling out new AI apps — or “application layers,” as he put it — at breakneck speed. They include products like ChatGPT that use large language models. No one knows which apps will take off, and those uncertain bets are driving huge demands on the power grid.
“Right now we’re really struggling,” Min said. “The risk is extremely high in the application layers.”
The Public Advocates Office, an independent consumer watchdog within the California Public Utilities Commission, recently warned that rapid data-center growth could leave Californians paying for billions of dollars in grid upgrades if projects never materialize or use far less power than promised. 
“Ratepayers could end up paying for costly infrastructure upgrades that may not be needed for many years – or at all,” the office said in its commentary.
Min said forecasting data-center load is a national challenge, but California will need better tools to keep rates in check, meet its clean-energy targets and stay competitive with states racing to attract data centers and high-paying tech jobs.
Local officials have also begun to grapple with the uncertainty. In San Jose, city energy officials say they are reluctant to procure additional power until they know which projects will actually be built. “We do not want to buy more power than we need,” said panelist Lori Mitchell, director of San Jose Clean Energy, the city’s publicly-owned electricity provider. “That’s job No. 1.”
What are the environmental concerns around the data center boom? 
California’s data-center boom is bringing a wave of environmental concerns that state officials are only beginning to understand. Those concerns center on water use, the carbon emissions tied to rising energy demand and the air pollution from diesel backup generators.
Air quality is a particular concern. While back-up generators run only intermittently, their presence is concentrated in a handful of regions. In Santa Clara County, where many facilities sit close together in dense industrial areas, the local impacts could be greater simply because so much equipment is packed into a small space.
Yet the state still has limited visibility into what data centers are doing. Attempts to require more transparency stalled this year amid tech industry opposition. The only measure that became law gives regulators the authority to determine whether data centers are driving up costs — but stops short of requiring environmental reporting.
Ahmad Thomas, CEO of the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, and another panelist, said his group opposed the electricity disclosure and water reporting measures because they would make California less competitive.
“It’s very hard to see a world where California is at the top of the AI pile if we do not have an approach to data centers that is — at minimum — mildly competitive with other states,” he added.
Consumer advocates say the lack of information leaves communities unprotected. “We certainly think there needs to be more transparency — that’s a good thing,” said panelist Mark Toney, the executive director of the The Utility Reform Network, a ratepayer advocacy group..
Will data centers slow down California’s switch to clean energy? 
The rapid growth of data centers could slow California’s clean-energy transition if it keeps the state tied to natural gas. And some of the carbon-free alternative energy sources that could meet their power needs are deeply controversial among environmentalists.
The state has pledged to reach 100% carbon-free electricity by 2045, yet it still depends heavily on natural-gas plants during hot summer days. A recent report by the environmental think tank Next 10 and UC Riverside estimated that data-center carbon emissions nearly doubled from 2019 to 2023 — largely from gas-fired generation — underscoring how even a relatively clean grid may struggle to absorb AI-driven load without higher emissions.
State leaders are making policy shifts as AI demand grows. California this year approved joining a broader Western power market, a move driven in part by new demands on the grid, including data centers. Critics warn the change could expose the state to dirtier electricity from other states and weaken its control over clean-energy rules.
Min of Stanford argues that California will need to rely on options some environmentalists would rather avoid. That includes holding onto existing resources like the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant. In a recent report, Min argued the state will also need more “clean, firm” power — resources that can operate around the clock — such as geothermal energy or natural-gas plants with carbon capture.
PG&E agrees. Spokesperson Stephanie Magallon told CalMatters in an email that nuclear power, carbon-capture systems and large solar-plus-battery projects are all options under consideration for powering data centers in its region. But environmental justice critics in California have opposed carbon capture technology calling it unproven tech that risks extending fossil-fuel use.
Mitchell said community choice aggregators can manage new data-center load while keeping power clean and affordable. San Jose’s mix is already 60% renewable, and she said the biggest opportunity is flexibility — getting data centers to shift use off the hottest afternoons so the city can avoid buying additional power.
Will data centers raise your electric bill? 
California’s data-center boom is reshaping the fight over electricity bills, exposing a divide over whether these new customers will lower costs — or drive them higher for everyone else.
PG&E argues that adding large users like data centers can lower rates because fixed grid costs would be spread across more customers. It also claims the grid is underutilized on average — operating at about 45% of capacity — although the grid faces real strain during the hottest hours and in parts of the system that routinely run close to their limits. If data centers can be connected in places with available capacity, PG&E argues, they could help spread costs without worsening congestion.
Toney, another panelist, urged the state to slow down, warning that California is planning major infrastructure without knowing which data centers are real or how their costs will land on customer bills.
“I’m worried that we’re engaged in what I call faith-based policymaking,” he said. “The benefits are very speculative, but the costs are very real.”
Some states, said Toney, have begun tightening rules around the growth of data centers. One law in Oregon will require data-center grid costs to remain off household bills.  A Minnesota law will give very large data centers their own billing category so regulators can keep their costs separate from other customers’ electric bills.
“This issue of data centers and the connection between affordability and clean energy is of national concern, and California is actually behind on this,” Toney said. “There’s this mythology about California being the leader all the time.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/120425_Edgecloud-Link-Data-Center_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

According to the financial consultant WalletHub, Utah places last on metrics measuring income disparity, and inequality in the state’s share of executive positions. 
The Utah Women and Leadership Project at Utah State University in partnership with the state published a brief studying 100 Utah companies that have implemented best practices that allow Utah women to succeed in the workplace. A fundamental one is the implementation of flexible work hours in addition to other family-friendly policies.

“Research on the importance of implementing flexible and family-friendly policies, programs, and practices in workplaces has been well documented,” the brief says. “In fact, there is a clear, direct link between companies that implement such strategies and the retention and advancement of women.”
The researchers have been measuring family friendly and women-focused initiatives in different workplaces in the state for three years, including paid and unpaid family leave, back-to-work maternity support, child care support, and adoption and fertility benefits. This year fewer companies reported offering those perks.
While 71% had unpaid family leave available — more than the 64% recorded in 2024 — only 63% offered paid maternity leave, less than the 69% reported in 2024. Also, 20% had adoption and fertility benefits, less than the 27% seen last year.

Susan Madsen, director of the Utah Women and Leadership Project, said she was particularly surprised to see a lower percentage of child care support, which went from 34% in 2024 to 25% this year.
“We’ve been talking about that more the last three years here in the state of Utah,” Madsen said. “And women and families need child care support most. In most families, if there’s two parents in the home, both of them are working, and so child care is really important.”
The benefit doesn’t necessarily translate into a child care center in the workplace, or stipends to cover day care expenses, Madsen said. 
“There’s a lot of other things that could be possible in helping and trying to support parents, not just women, with child care,” she said. “Sick days, letting people do remote work when their kids are sick, or various things like that.”
There was still a good number of companies that offered flexible hours in the list the researchers studied, though it went from 98% last year to 94% in 2025. Remote work was also available at 83% of the workplaces this year, less than the 91% seen in 2024.



Let us know what you think...


 


“These are some of the top companies or top organizations. It’s just interesting to see what they’re doing and what things are jumping to the top of the list,” Madsen added. “For women, flexible work hours and some options for remote work just continue to be absolutely critical.”
Another popular initiative among the 100 companies was an annual review of pay equity, with 82% of the organizations reporting they conduct studies on everyone’s salaries.
“We can’t generalize it to the rest of the population. I’m sure there’s a lot of workplaces that don’t do these things and are not really concerned about doing things,” Madsen said. But it gives us as companies and workers a good look at what people are doing. What should we look at doing more in our organizations?” 
The report encouraged other organizations to open opportunities to make a more inclusive workplace for women. It also recommended that state legislators consider and support policies that will help Utah to host more family-friendly workplaces. 
“When businesses consider organizational-level strategies, initiatives and programs, including family-friendly practices and policies that support all employees and help them thrive, Utah can increase the representation of women in businesses around the state, which is important to ensure more women and their families can thrive,” researchers wrote.

(Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Amid ongoing federal and state attempts to limit access to vaccines or loosen vaccination requirements, data shows that Alabama has fallen below national averages for children being up to date on some vaccines.
The state is trailing the country for uptake of vaccines for whooping cough and Hepatitis B, while immunization rates against measles have swung above and below rates that experts consider necessary to attain herd immunity.
The vaccination rate for children aged 13-17 nationwide remained high in 2024, but it drops significantly in Alabama as children age. Where about 70% of 4-10-year-olds are up to date on vaccines statewide, only 25% of children 11-18 years old are up to date.

Experts say misinformation and struggles to access medical care around the state are playing a role.
“There were several insurance companies that didn’t even cover routine immunizations,” Dr. Norma Mobley, a Mobile-based pediatrician, said. “We at the AAP level, that was something that they really worked hard toward making sure that all children under insurance policies could receive routine, recommended vaccines.”
Mobley, president of the Alabama chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), has started to see cases of whooping cough, a highly contagious respiratory infection, despite a vaccine for the disease existing for nearly 30 years. 
Statewide, 69% of Alabama’s 19-47-month-olds are up to date on the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, according to data from ADPH. Nationwide, 80.4% of children in the U.S. are vaccinated against whooping cough by the time they turn two in 2021, according to the CDC. The CDC recommends doses of the DTaP vaccine at one- and two-months-old.
Mobley said in an interview Tuesday that she has seen younger parents as more hesitant to vaccinate their children. That, along with how long it takes for a child to be fully vaccinated has led to the return of diseases that are no longer common, she said.
“If you’re going to give them the vaccines, you might as well just do them the way they’re scheduled,” Mobley said “You’re still going to poke them the same number of times, whether you do them a week apart or not.”
Misinformation from social media has also contributed to a decrease in vaccinations, especially for influenza vaccines, Mobley said.
“We had a lot of people reading sources saying that there’s a combination of the flu and the COVID vaccine,” she said. “That’s not true.”
Influenza

According to the ADPH data, 6.3% of Alabamians 18 years old and under were vaccinated against influenza for the 2025-26 flu season as of Nov. 25. The season spans from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30, 2026, according to ADPH. In the 2024-25 flu season, 13.1% of children were vaccinated against influenza, according to the data. The CDC recommends a flu shot every year starting at 6-months-old, with some children needing two doses.
According to the ADPH data, about 345,000 adults have gotten the flu vaccine so far this season, which is about half of all adults that received the vaccine in the 2024-25 season.
Dr. Wes Stubblefield, district medical officer at ADPH, said the best way to combat misinformation on vaccines is a good patient-physician relationship.
“We want to make sure that our providers are having conversations with their parents, with their patients and parents, especially those that have questions about vaccines or or have not received vaccines in the past,” Stubblefield said in an interview Wednesday. 
Efforts to loosen vaccination requirements have taken hold in the Alabama Legislature. A bill sponsored by Sen. Arthur Orr, R-Decatur, that would have allowed parents to declare their children religiously exempt from vaccines failed in the 2025 session, but Rep. Mack Butler, R-Rainbow City, pre-filed a similar bill for the 2026 legislative session, which starts in January.  
HB 24 would allow parents or guardians to object to vaccination or testing requirements by submitting a written statement stating that the vaccination or testing conflicts with their religion as valid grounds for exemption from any school enrollment vaccine or testing requirement. It also specified that no additional forms, fees or documentation could be required of the parent, guardian or child for enrollment in any public K-12 school. The bill would have also extended these provisions to public colleges and universities. 
Mobley said vaccinating children is ethical practice because it keeps children out of harm’s way.
“We take a vow when we graduate from medical school to do no harm,” she said. “If we know we’re holding back on something that could place that patient at risk, then to me, that’s placing them in harm’s way.”
Friday, the federal Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices voted to end a 35-year recommendation to vaccinate infants against hepatitis B virus (HBV) on the day they are born. The new recommendation is to only vaccinate infants whose mothers test positive for the disease or have not tested. 
According to the Mayo Clinic, HBV is a viral liver disease that can be transmitted through sexual or blood contact with somebody who is not vaccinated or from a mother to her baby. It can cause liver failure, liver cancer and cirrhosis. For most, the disease lasts six months or less, but it can also be chronic. 
According to the ADPH data, about 76% of 19-47-month-olds in Alabama are up to date on the HBV vaccine. It is one of two vaccines infants get the day they are born. According to the CDC, 91.4% of children in the U.S. were fully vaccinated against HBV by the time they turned two in 2021.

Amid outbreaks of the disease around the country, Alabama reported a confirmed case of measles this year, the first in the state since 2002. An unvaccinated child under five years old contracted the highly contagious disease while traveling outside the country. ADPH later said the child recovered.
Mobley said she has not seen any pushback against the MMR vaccine. According to the Centers for Disease Control, measles immunity has moved up and down in recent years. About 95.3% of Alabama kindergarteners were vaccinated against measles in the 2024-25 school year, more than the 95% considered necessary for herd immunity. But it was about 93.8% for kindergarteners the year prior.  
“Herd immunity is 95% so we’re still pretty close. We’re doing a good job in our state in that regard,” she said.
According to the ADPH data, 77% of children under 10 are up to date on the MMR vaccine. According to Cleveland Clinic, children typically receive the second dose of the vaccine between four and six years old.
Some counties, especially in Dale, Henry and Houston in the Wiregrass, have significantly lower vaccination rates, according to the data. Mobley said there are small groups of parents throughout the state that are either skeptical, hesitant or against vaccinating their kids. 
“The only thing that we try to make sure they do is go through the health department to obtain those exemptions so that it is documented through the registry, so we know who’s not immunized,” Mobley said of those who seek vaccine exemptions.
Stubblefield said that access to health care could contribute to it, especially in Wiregrass counties, like Dale, Henry and Houston. According to the data, 49% of 19-47-month-old children are up to date on vaccines in Dale County. Henry and Houston counties are at 53% and 52%, respectively, for the same age group. Statewide, 65% of the same age group is up to date.
“We also have some counties in Alabama that have very limited access to vaccinations in general, particularly in the south central and southwest part of the state,” he said.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Child-getting-vaccine-for-Aug-29-2025-story.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

Amid economic uncertainty, the panel charged with estimating Nevada state government revenues kept projections modest earlier this year.
It appears their caution was warranted.
On paper, Nevada’s revenue appears to be exceeding its forecast by 6.7%. But that number is artificially inflated by administrative anomalies, state legislative staff told the Economic Forum on Friday.
True performance, after accounting for anomalies that created one-time windfalls, is around 2% above the deliberately cautious forecast.
“We were purposefully being conservative” when finalizing the biennium revenue forecast earlier this year, said forum member Marvin Leavitt, “and it looks like that’s fairly close to what’s actually been happening.”
Expecting the dramatic shift in U.S. economic policy following the election of Donald Trump to a second presidential term — policy that has been rubber-stamped by the Republican-controlled Congress —  the Nevada Economic Forum approved a conservative revenue forecast in December 2024. Then, they nudged that forecast down in May 2025 in response to the first few months of the new administration, including the so-called “Liberation Day” tariffs Trump had announced a month earlier.
A bumpy rollout of the state’s tax collection system, combined with a massive cyberattack on the state, led to around $80 million in commerce tax revenue being collected in the first quarter of the current fiscal year when it should have been collected during the previous fiscal year.  Another unique accounting matter stemmed from the Legislature  shortening the timeframe for businesses to transfer money categorized as unclaimed revenue to the state, accounting for a one-time revenue boost of $120 million.
Excluding those anomalies, sales tax revenue is slightly underperforming and commerce tax revenue is basically flat.
“The forecast right now is holding,” said top state fiscal analyst, Michael Nakamoto. “I think that all things considered, it is doing quite well right now.”
Sales tax is by far the largest generator of state revenue, comprising close to a third of general fund revenue. Trump’s re-election sparked alarms among economists about the impact of tariffs and a global trade war.
Among the state’s other major sources of revenue, the insurance premium tax is performing best — 10.3% above forecast after one quarter of tax collections.
Gaming revenue, the second largest revenue generator for the state, is 8.7% above its forecast after five months of tax collections, but Nakamoto cautioned against interpreting that as anything but “we’re doing okay right now.”
Annual visitor volume to Southern Nevada is down 7.6% as of October, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. Flights in and out of Harry Reid International Airport were down 8.2% in October 2025 compared to October 2024, and down 5.1% year over year.
Gaming revenue is trending downward in Clark County if you remove baccarat, according to Nakamoto. Baccarat is dominated by a small number of high-end players who spend “a whole lot of money.”
“Sometimes they are lucky, and sometimes they are not,” said Nakamoto. “I think the easy way to explain this is: The houses have gotten very lucky from a (small) number of people, and because baccarat is effectively, statistically, a coin flip, that could very easily swing the other direction.”
Nevada’s live entertainment tax (LET) is currently 1.3% below its forecast, though there is a stark difference in performance when broken down by gaming and non-gaming properties.
LET from events not associated with gaming venues — like The Sphere, T-Mobile Arena, or Allegiant Stadium — are up 44.7% after three months of tax collections. LET from events at venues inside a casino property are down 23.9% after four months of tax collections.
Two other revenue streams categorized as “major” by the forum are both underperforming against their forecasts after one quarter of tax collections. Modified business tax is down 4.3%, and real property transfer tax is down 4.8%.
Non-major revenue sources are down by 14.5% year to date.
Notable among those: Nevada’s transportation connection excise tax, which captures taxis and rideshare services, is down nearly 40% in the first three months of collections.
Similarly, revenue from short-term car rentals started out the fiscal year badly — down 30% after four months.
While not major revenue sources, those revenue streams are often seen as indicators of tourism strength.
The Economic Forum did not make any adjustments to the state forecast on Friday.
The forum is expected to reconvene in June for another check in on Nevada’s economy and state revenues.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/GettyImages-2210332783-1024x540.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

Nuclear Advisory Council)For me, the news surrounding the future of the V.C. Summer site is more than an industry headline. It feels like a homecoming.
I started my career at V.C. Summer, working alongside hundreds of dedicated engineers, technicians and community leaders who believed deeply in the promise of nuclear energy. We believed in what the project could mean for the state — reliable power, good-paying jobs, and a long-term investment in South Carolina’s economic resilience.
Those early years shaped not only my professional path but my commitment to advancing nuclear energy as a force for progress.
Seeing momentum return to V.C. Summer brings both pride and hope.
Pride because I know the caliber of the people who poured their expertise, sweat and heart into the site.
Hope because the renewed attention signals something bigger — a second chance to fulfill the potential this project has always held.
The future of V.C. Summer isn’t just about reactors, concrete, or systems.
It’s about people. It’s about the workforce that will be trained, the families who will thrive on new opportunities, and the communities that will benefit.
When a state commits to developing nuclear infrastructure, it commits to stability, innovation, and economic strength for decades to come.
That’s why events like the 2nd Annual South Carolina Nuclear Summit are so important to our state and industry.
Leaders from across the country will gather here in South Carolina to discuss the future of nuclear energy, the electric grid and the role our state can play in strengthening the energy landscape.
As someone who began his career at V.C. Summer, I see this summit as a powerful opportunity for professionals to come together, share ideas and advance the conversations that will shape our region’s growing need for nuclear infrastructure, reactor development, and reliable clean energy.
New nuclear power plants don’t make sense for South Carolina

South Carolina is uniquely positioned right now.
With the right vision, V.C. Summer can be a catalyst — not only for energy generation but for job creation, technology development, and statewide economic growth.
As someone who has spent nearly two decades in nuclear development, both in the field and through years of research leadership, I’ve seen firsthand what successful deployment requires.
It takes technical excellence, committed leadership, intentional planning, and a shared belief in the long-term value of clean, reliable energy.
It also takes experienced teams who understand the complexities of nuclear development from design to deployment — and who know how to get the work done safely and responsibly.
V.C. Summer shaped the beginning of my career.
Seeing its next chapter unfold is a symbol of what’s possible when South Carolina leads with vision and persistence.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/IMG_2264-1024x705.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

McKinney Award by the National Homelessness Law Center,Sonya Quick,,,,,https://calmatters.org/inside-the-newsroom/2025/12/homelessness-award/,"CalMatters’ homelessness coverage this year has spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources that led to real-world impact.","In summary
CalMatters’ homelessness coverage this year has spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources that led to real-world impact.


CalMatters was honored with the Stewart B. McKinney Award by the National Homelessness Law Center in November. The awards honor “leaders who raise awareness about and advance solutions to homelessness and poverty.”
As a part of its 2025 Human Right to Housing awards, the center highlighted CalMatters’ “multi-part, multimedia series, spending several months interviewing experts on homelessness, doing a deep dive on all available data and most importantly, visiting encampments to document firsthand how enforcement efforts have displaced unhoused people and the devastating aftermath of these cruel and inhumane sweeps. It is exactly this type of journalistic integrity that our country so desperately needs in this time of misinformation, and we are so grateful for the high-quality reporting that CalMatters is bringing to the homelessness crisis.”
CalMatters reporting has captured the day-to-day reality for homeless people on the streets of California.
A great example of this is our series documenting the impact of Grants Pass v. Johnson, when the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that cities did not have to have a shelter bed available before punishing someone for sleeping on the street. That ruling, stemming from an ordinance enacted by an Oregon town, has had huge consequences for California, home to more unhoused individuals than any other state, more than 187,000 by the most recent count.
CalMatters journalists spent four months interviewing experts, requesting data and making a dozen visits to encampments in San Francisco and Fresno to document enforcement efforts and follow the unhoused people displaced when their camps were cleared. Our public media partner, KPBS, did extensive reporting and visits to encampments in San Diego. 
Our reporting showed that every time a homeless person is forced to move, the odds that they lose something increase. That can include identification and documentation critical to obtaining housing and the medication a person needs to survive. Moving also makes it harder for someone to stay in touch with case managers and social workers working to get homeless people into housing.
Homeless Californians also have more difficulty getting to jobs and keeping appointments like court dates. Every time they get arrested or forced to move, that gets harder. Missed court dates can eventually lead to warrants and fines: More barriers to obtaining housing and getting off the street.
CalMatters’ homelessness coverage also spanned multiple investigations, stories and resources. Our work has led to real-world impact.
Two California families were reunited in 2025 after seeing loved ones who are homeless quoted in CalMatters articles. One woman found her sister after losing contact with her in 2019. Another woman found her father, who she’d been searching for without luck. In addition to sharing the stories of these two families, CalMatters also created a resource on what to do if your loved one is homeless.
Fremont backed down after proposing a ban on ‘aiding and abetting’ homeless encampments.
In 2025, Fremont’s city council revised a new city camping ordinance, removing what had become a controversial clause — first reported on by CalMatters — that could have punished those “aiding and abetting” encampments. The ordinance makes it illegal to camp on streets, sidewalks, parks and other public property, but what separated it from other efforts was explicit language that would make anyone “causing, permitting, aiding, abetting or concealing” an illegal encampment guilty of a misdemeanor. Local homeless advocates feared this could be enforced against  workers and volunteers providing aid to unhoused people in Fremont.
Lawmakers advanced a new bill to increase homeless shelter oversight, citing our reporting as the catalyst for action.
Under the new proposal, local governments would be required to perform annual inspections of taxpayer-funded shelters, and cities and counties could lose state funding if they fail to correct code violations or keep neglecting to file mandatory reports. The bill has passed the assembly and is on to the senate. The 2025 proposal followed a CalMatters exposé on homeless shelter failures, and our 2024 investigation revealing that cities and counties have been ignoring a state law requiring basic safety and sanitation checks in shelters. Watch lawmakers discuss this bill, and our reporting. 
A CalMatters lawsuit forced LA officials to turn over secret homeless shelter complaints.
In 2025, Los Angeles officials began releasing thousands of internal records related to conditions inside homeless shelters in response to a CalMatters lawsuit challenging their repeated public records denials. The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority, better known as LAHSA committed to releasing at least 175 incident reports every other week until the public records request is fulfilled. The agency estimated there are 5,000 such reports.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in November announced new restrictions to Continuum of Care Program funding, which is the largest pocket of federal funding states rely on to address homelessness. 
Under the new rule, no more than 30% of federal grants received by jurisdictions from the program can go toward funding permanent housing. 
Nevada could lose an estimated $13 million in funding and an estimated 925 people would lose housing, according to the NAEH analysis.
The move is expected to displace 170,000 people nationally.
The new requirement came as a surprise since Congress already authorized the funds “to be a two year funding cycle,” said Catrina Peters, the Homeless Services Coordinator with Washoe County.
As the Trump administration has reversed long-standing approaches to homelessness, local governments and nonprofits that rely on federal funding to support homeless programs have been preparing for future changes. 
Yet the funding notice was still unanticipated, Peters said. 
“We would really love to at least have some time to be able to plan for these changes, and have a little runway to be able to work with folks on what some different options might be, instead of just being pushed off a cliff, which is what it feels like right now,” she said. 
Both Clark and Washoe counties dedicate close to 90% of its federal Continuum of Care funding toward permanent housing, the NAEH found. 
“For us, that’s a $1.9 million cut to programs that are currently housing people,” Peters said. 
The NAEH analysis estimates 738 beds will be lost in Clark County, 139 beds in Washoe County, and 48 in the rest of the state. 
The “most conservative” estimate projected by Washoe County indicates 88 households would lose assistance, Peters said, adding the figure doesn’t factor in other potential changes to eligibility requirements, such as proposed work requirements the administration has proposed to place on housing assistance.
Regardless, the most vulnerable populations, including those with disabilities and seniors, could potentially lose housing under the new rules. 
“When we think about people with a permanent disability, which is an eligibility criteria for people to get on the program, that’s unlikely to change,” Peters said. “Once folks get into the housing programs, reducing that funding puts those folks who are in those programs at risk” of re-entering homelessness. 
Clark County wouldn’t confirm if the breakdown provided by NAEH was accurate. 
“This is an emerging challenge that we are currently working to navigate,” Jennifer Cooper, a spokeswoman for Clark County, said in an email. “It would be appropriate for us to engage with you on this when we have information to share.” 
HUD’s swift and sudden reversal comes as the Trump Administration has vowed to move away from the “housing first” approach to homelessness, which focuses on getting people stably housed before treatment. 
Despite “housing first” being supported by homeless advocates, social service providers, and state and local jurisdictions, the administration has pushed to prioritize treatment before housing. 
Trump issued an executive order in July that sought to crack down on homelessness by pressuring cities to criminalize unhoused people or push them into institutions, and called for “ending support for ‘housing first’ policies,” saying they “deprioritize accountability.”
Peters said they have continued to use the housing first model ​​because of a “mountain of evidence showing its effectiveness.”
NAEH and the National Low Income Housing Coalition, along with several municipal governments, filed a lawsuit last week against the administration over the new requirements, warning the sudden changes are reckless and will lead to a steep rise in homelessness. 
The groups argued the two-year funding cycle authorized by Congress in 2024 sought to give communities greater stability in how they run programs used to house people. 
“It rescinded the two-year notice of funding opportunity (NOFO) and replaced it with a new one, initiating a new competition for FY 2025 awards,” according to the lawsuit. “This decision will severely delay essential funding for housing, as HUD now says it will not make any new awards until May at the earliest.”
Twenty states and the District of Columbia have also filed suit to stop the rules, arguing they violate federal law.
Nevada has not joined any of the lawsuits. 
Alcinia Whiters, a spokeswoman for Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford, said the state didn’t join the lawsuit because state agencies, such as the Nevada Housing Division and the Department of Human Services “do not receive HUD Continuum of Care funding.”
Rather it is the counties that receive funding directly from HUD.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54642266096_fd9c809767_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 09:56:33.828196

(Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)Back in 1997, a group of students formed an organization for gay and lesbian undergraduates at Fordham University. They applied for official club status at our Catholic school.
As the time and setting may suggest, this was far more difficult than it should have been. After a lot of temporizing, the administration denied the LGBTQ+ group status. The reasons were nonsensical. And those of us who worked at the campus newspaper, The Ram, said as much in an editorial.
What did the university do to us?
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Nothing.
We continued to cover our campus, and the people on it, as best we could. And while individual administrators grumbled, they didn’t interfere. At some level, the school recognized that it was better for the community to let students speak about their thoughts, their experiences and their hopes, even when those weren’t the same as the administration’s.
I thought back to this last week after the University of Alabama shut down two student magazines — Alice, aimed at women, and Nineteen Fifty-Six, covering Black culture and lifestyle — claiming that their existence was an affront to the Trump administration’s project of driving anyone who isn’t a white man out of public life.
There was no other reason to close the publications. Both found a balance between major issues and lighter fare, as good magazines do. Alice had articles on shoes and tattoos, as well as features on UA workers and a thoughtful essay on women and body images.
One recent issue of Nineteen Fifty-Six had solid pieces on evolving definitions of family and the popular exploitation of Black childhood, as well as recipes and songs.
You’d have to be the most brittle person on the planet to consider anything published by these magazines offensive, let alone discriminatory. Unfortunately, we live under the rule of people whose skin could be punctured by a feather.
To justify the closures, UA Vice President for Student Life Steven Hood cited a July memo from U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi. Like other attempts at discrimination — including Alabama’s — the language is absurdly, purposefully broad.
Hood said the magazines operated as “unlawful proxies.” Bondi defined these as “ostensibly neutral criteria that function as substitutes for explicit consideration of race, sex, or other protected characteristics.”
This is vague to the point of meaninglessness. Which a halfway competent attorney — and UA has many skilled ones — could point out.  If the school felt that its student organizations risked legal attack, it could mount a very good case in court.
And, in fact, Bondi gave them ammunition. The memo goes on to cite examples of “unlawful proxy” as asking job candidates to describe how their backgrounds inform their performance, or recruiting from areas because of racial or ethnic composition, or daring to state how racism shaped their lives.
This is all discriminatory in the arrogant, smugger-than-thou way of this White House. But nowhere does Bondi suggest that a publication aimed at a particular group of students would violate the administration’s already absurd policies against diversity, equity and inclusion.
That’s a fight UA could have.
But it won’t. If anything, school leadership seems to be using the memo for its own purposes.
When students and professors sued the university over its closures of dedicated spaces for the Black Student Union and LGBTQ+ students — thanks, SB 129 — attorneys for UA said the memo justified their refusal to bring the spaces back.
At first, this only seemed craven. But at some point, cowardice became connivance.
Hood said there were no complaints about Alice or Nineteen Fifty-Six that led to their suspension. So one has to conclude that the university is shutting these  publications on its own initiative. There’s nothing in the Bondi memo that can possibly justify this.
Which leads to the inevitable question: What does UA want its students to be?
Should its graduates emerge from Tuscaloosa as independent, open-minded people who can think, express themselves clearly and learn from other people’s experiences?
Or should they be meek, sheltered and deferential individuals, hostile to anything that’s different and silent if they don’t conform?
Right now, UA is leaning toward the latter. The school is telling Black and female students that they are not part of the campus community. And that their experiences, no matter how mundane, are illegitimate and threatening.
That they need to shut up. UA isn’t bending the knee. It’s helping Trump lift the wall.
To their credit, UA students aren’t falling silent. Look no further than the Crimson White, UA’s undergraduate newspaper. It broke the news of the shutdown and continues to report on the situation with calm, clarity and context.
It’s student media at its best: forthright, informed and earnest. As Alice and Nineteen Fifty-Six were. Taking a community not as a blob to be shoved into a mold, but the sum of many different parts. Each worthy of exploration and understanding.
UA administrators might learn something from that.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 08:57:27.729486

The Alabama Professional Workforce Protection Act, sponsored by Rep. Napoleon Bracy, D-Saraland, would recognize nursing, physician assistants; physical therapy; education; counseling; social work; public health; speech-language pathology; accounting engineering, and architecture as professional programs. All were excluded from recent decisions by the White House, which the Trump administration has said was an effort to cap maximum borrowing for certain degrees.
Bracy, who works at a federally qualified health center in South Alabama, said in an interview earlier this month the changes could deter students.

“I noticed that more and more people started to kind of talk about it,” he said. “And it was kind of making people look at changing their minds about career fields and paths that they were looking at going forward, maybe not being able to become a nurse practitioner or physician, just seemed like it created an additional burden on people, and I felt like we needed to do something about it.”
According to the Code of Federal Regulations, a professional degree shows completion of both academic requirements and professional skills that are more than a typical bachelor’s degree requires. Professional licenses are also typically required for these degrees.
The changes to professional student classificationswere first outlined in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed over the summer.
The U.S. Department of Education said in a statement on Nov. 24 that a professional degree is “an internal definition used by the department to distinguish among programs that qualify for higher loan limits.”
“Misinformation on TikTok has caused confusion about the Trump Administration’s ongoing actions to implement student loan caps for graduate students. While still in development, the Trump administration is implementing long-needed loan limits on graduate loans to drive down the cost of programs,” Ellen Keast, press secretary for higher education, said in a statement last week.
Previously, graduate students seeking professional degrees could borrow up to the cost of attendance in federal student loans. Now, under the new limits, professional degree seekers, including those in medicine (M.D.), dentistry (D.D.S./D.M.D.) and law (L.L.B./J.D.), can borrow up to $200,000 while those not in a professional degree program can borrow up to $100,000.
Keast’s statement said that 95% of nursing students would not be affected, while “the most expensive outlying 5%” would be grandfathered into existing limits. 
“We expect that institutions charging tuition rates well above market prices will consider lowering tuition thanks to these historic reforms,” the statement said.
Keast did not mention what data the department received this information from or what TikTok videos have caused misinformation.
The Alabama Board of Nursing (ABN) and the Alabama Hospital Association (ALAHA) wrote to the U.S. Department of Education in a joint letter on Nov. 26 saying that recognizing nursing as a professional degree “is necessary to ensure that our state and nation can meet the challenges facing the healthcare workforce.”
“A professional degree carries with it significant financial advantages for individuals pursuing post-baccalaureate education to advance in various professions, which, under current regulations, include medicine, dentistry, and pharmacy, among others,” the letter said. “Given the rigor of educational, licensing, and regulatory policies required to obtain and maintain licensure as a nurse, as well as long-standing public regard of the discipline as a distinct profession, it is natural that nursing should be included in this definition.”
Honor Ingel, chief communications officer for ABN said in an interview Friday the board stands by the letter.
“We’re not speaking to the Department of Education’s intent there. We just believe that we should not be interfering with the pipeline at this time for healthcare workers specifically,” Ingel said.
Bracy said Alabama is experiencing a “workforce crisis.”
Alabama workforce participation rate has trailed the nation’s for at least 50 years. According to the Alabama Department of Workforce, the state’s workforce participation rate in August was 57.7%. This is lower than the national average of 62.4% reported in September. Experts have cited several factors, including a lack of training, a lack of transportation and a lack of child care for Alabama’s lagging rate. 
Alabama State Superintendent Eric Mackey said after the October State Board of Education meeting the state is seeing a shortage in special education teachers even after funding from the Alabama Legislature.
“[The funding] has helped but what we’re continuing to see is that we have a shortage of special needs teachers especially in rural areas, and especially in areas like autism,” Mackey said.
Ingle said the healthcare industry is also experiencing a shortage due to older generations retiring.
“As the as the final Baby Boomers and Generation X start to retire, we are we’re looking at potentially, you know, major drop in the number of nurses Practicing and providing care to Alabamians, and that includes Advanced Practice Nurses, [Certified Registered Nurse Infusions] CNIs, [Certified Registered Nurse Practitioners] CRNPs and [Certified Nurse-Midwives] CNMs.”
Bracy said the Professional Workforce Protection Act would protect incentives for workers.
“If we protect [these degrees], it allows people to have more of an incentive to go into these career paths where taking this away, it really hurts them in the long run,” he said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-12-08 12:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,About 36K in CT are at risk of losing SNAP benefits. Here’s what to know.,Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/12/08/ct-snap-cuts-big-beautiful-bill/,"Cuts to SNAP in the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” will affect thousands of people, who could lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.","About 36,000 Connecticut residents are at risk of losing access to food stamp benefits due to new eligibility requirements outlined in a recent federal bill.
The cuts to food assistance in H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, will directly affect thousands of immigrants, young adults, veterans and people experiencing homelessness because of new, stricter work requirements and other changes. They are expected to lose coverage between Dec. 1 and March 31.
The people affected represent about 10% of the state’s residents who receive benefits through the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
“We’re going to have a whole lot of people who don’t have access to the food they need to stay healthy,” said Sara Parker McKernan, policy advocate for New Haven Legal Assistance. “People are going to eat as frugally as they can, which means a lot of really inexpensive foods that they’re able to buy because they don’t have the advantage of SNAP anymore.”
Here’s what’s happening with food assistance changes under the bill.
Who is affected by the changes?
H.R. 1 imposes a work requirement on adults 55 through 64 and parents with children 14 and older for the first time. It removes exemptions for veterans, people experiencing homelessness and young people who recently aged out of foster care — exemptions that were added in bipartisan legislation in 2023, according to an analysis by the Center on Budget Policy and Priorities. Recipients must now document 20 hours of work per week, participate in a narrow set of work activities or prove they qualify for another exemption.
The bill also ends eligibility for many immigrants living lawfully in the U.S. who have been granted humanitarian protection by the federal government, including refugees, people granted asylum and certain survivors of domestic violence and sex trafficking.
“We’re talking about folks who have been physical laborers their entire life, and all of a sudden, they’re getting to the stage where their bodies are giving out and they can no longer compete with younger workers,” McKernan said. “We’re talking about folks who have raised their kids or grandkids and now have an empty house and no work history. They may have kids over the age of 14, but they can’t act in that caretaker role and get SNAP.”
What do advocates say?
Advocates worry the changes will mean more families will go hungry.
“When you’ve got a family who are looking at a budget that doesn’t work – their income doesn’t balance with their expenses — they start saying, ‘What can we squeeze?’ Rent is what it is, you have no power to negotiate health insurance premiums, the cost of gas is what it is. One area where families have some flexibility to squeeze a budget down is food,” said Lisa Tepper Bates, president and CEO of the United Way of Connecticut.
Some families might lean toward purchasing foods that are calorie-dense to maintain their caloric intake but that aren’t nutrient-dense, health officials said. That can lead to conditions like obesity, diabetes and heart disease.
“When I was working full-time running a shelter for families experiencing homelessness, this is the part of their budget where they were looking to spend as little as possible so they could maximize what they had for rent,” Tepper Bates said. “What that meant was often, for a family with two small kids, they’re buying a 10-pound bag of white rice and five pounds of the cheapest hamburger meat they can find, and that’s going to be the basis of their food for the week. That is simply not adequate nutrition.”
Are there legal challenges?
Attorney General William Tong announced late last month that he and 21 other attorneys general are suing the federal government, seeking to block new guidance from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that deems some immigrants ineligible for food assistance even after they become permanent residents.
In October, the USDA issued new guidance to state agencies describing changes to SNAP eligibility under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Tong said the memo incorrectly asserted that all individuals who entered the country through certain pathways — including refugees, asylum recipients and others — would remain permanently ineligible for SNAP, even after obtaining green cards and becoming lawful permanent residents. The attorneys general argue the guidance contradicts federal law and could impose large financial penalties on states.
“The Trump Administration cannot help themselves. They are messing with SNAP benefits again. This time they are inventing their own rules to permanently ban legal immigrants — green card holders — from ever receiving food stamps,” Tong said in a statement. “There is zero basis in the law for this cruel move, and we’re suing to stop them.”
Will the state step in with funding?
With many poised to lose benefits, advocates are asking elected officials to create a state-funded food assistance program to fill the gap.
Since at least the 1990s, Connecticut had a state-financed food stamp program for legal immigrants who otherwise would have been eligible for the federal program but were excluded by welfare reform legislation in 1996. The legislature in August 2016 directed the state Department of Social Services to stop adding people to the program, though the initiative was funded through 2017, officials with DSS said.
In September, representatives with Greater Hartford Legal Aid, New Haven Legal Assistance and Connecticut Legal Services sent a letter to Gov. Ned Lamont and Democratic legislative leaders asking them to, among other things, establish a state-funded food assistance program for previously eligible legal immigrants and others who may lose SNAP benefits.
“We urge you to address the imminent harm to low-income CT residents that cuts to SNAP in H.R. 1 are poised to inflict. Our low-income clients depend on SNAP benefits to feed themselves and their families and depend on information and resources provided by DSS to access those benefits,” six people with those organizations wrote.
Sen. Matthew Lesser, a Democrat from Middletown who is co-chair of the Human Services Committee, said he and his colleagues are interested in exploring a state-funded food assistance program during the legislative session that begins in February. Launching such an initiative would require money and software upgrades to run it, he said.
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, pointed to a $500 million emergency fund authorized during the special session this month as one way to help residents losing access to SNAP. “This is an example of what the fund could be used for,” he said. “Obviously, the governor has a lot of discretion, and we have to vote on it. If the governor were to come to us and say, ‘I’d like to help out these folks who are getting kicked off SNAP,’ I would support that.”
A spokesman for Lamont said the governor is still reviewing how to use money in the emergency fund.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1105_SR_SNAPFoodPantries_070-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Rich Townsend/Getty Images)New Mexico Department of Health experts on Friday announced an expedited timeline for the state’s new medical psilocybin program during the program’s first advisory board meeting.
The seven members of the newly formed Medical Psilocybin Advisory Board met virtually with DOH experts, state Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) and dozens of members of the public to discuss the status of the program and a draft of the program’s operational procedures.
The program was created during the regular legislative session earlier this year through the passage of Senate Bill 219, cosponsored by Steinborn. The bill established the program and advisory board, as well as made the use of psilocybin legal in the state in controlled, qualified medical treatment settings. New Mexico is the third state in the country to allow psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, for therapeutic use.
“We are experiencing a new renaissance…of psychedelic medicine,” Steinborn said during the board meeting. He added that other states will be watching and learning from how New Mexico’s program is established. “By definition, we’re pioneers and we’re going to learn a lot, but I also want to challenge you to not be afraid to try new things, to innovate, to make things better than maybe they’ve been in other states, in some cases.”
Medical Psilocybin Act becomes law in New Mexico, but what’s next?

According to the bill, patients will qualify for the psilocybin program and treatment if they are diagnosed with major treatment-resistance depression; post traumatic stress disorder; substance use disorders; end-of-life care; and other conditions approved of by the DOH. The bill also states that the program must be implemented no later than Dec. 31, 2027.
Dominick Zurlo, director of the Center for Medical Cannabis and Psilocybin, said during the meeting that the DOH has set the goal of opening the program to the public a year early. The department has also hired a program manager and are working to fill the roles of environmental scientist and compliance officer.
“Because there has been such large interest in this and a push for us to try to be able to help people with psilocybin treatments earlier, we have set a goal now to have the program at least to be able to see the initial patients by the end of December of 2026,” Zurlo said. 
During public comment, attendees voiced support and excitement for the program’s creation. Others said they were curious about the possibility of trying the treatment when it becomes available; how the supply chain will work with local mushroom growers; and how licensing will work for medical providers.
Denali Wilson, director of strategic support for the nonprofit Healing Advocacy Fund, said her organization is ready to provide input to the DOH as the program takes shape. She said its priorities are safety, a “clear code of ethics,” systems for measuring outcomes and patient affordability.
“While it is important for the program to move forward with urgency, achieving the right balance of safety, affordability and equity will require careful attention and thoughtfulness,” Wilson said. “Let’s be sure that any acceleration of the regulatory timeline doesn’t unintentionally compromise patient safety, undermine long-term sustainability or limit meaningful public engagement.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/RichTownsendGettyImages-mushroomsDec72025purchased-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

She is an English and history teacher at Winooski High School, and 2025 Vermont state teacher of the year.



In my classroom, we do a lot of challenging learning. When given a hard task, we spend time reading multiple sources, asking questions, interviewing stakeholders, listening to diverse perspectives and synthesizing multiple perspectives. 
A good learner revises their thinking when given new information; we will often use sentence frames such as “I used to think… then I learned… now I think” to track our learning.

Recognizing the nuances of an issue is not a failure; it’s a success. When my students recognize complexities of an issue, it’s a win not a failure. 
Our members of the redistricting task force did just this: they listened to community input, reckoned with the complexities of the task, and rather than pushing through with the “assignment,” they bravely proposed an alternative solution. 
And yet, Gov. Phil Scott and his team deemed this a failure, claiming that the task force had given up and failed. Nothing could be further from the truth: when my students understand the complexities of an issue and propose nuanced solutions to difficult problems, that is a win. Why would it not be the same for our state’s leaders? 
If the governor is so annoyed about the direction of the task force, I wonder why his team has not produced any numbers that reflect actual cost savings of consolidation. It became abundantly clear to the task force that a plan to consolidate districts lacks clear financial savings. If the administration disagrees, where are these numbers? 
The courage from the task force members allows us to refocus this upcoming legislative season on the real needs in front of Vermonters and our schools. Rather than debate consolidation maps that do not prove to save money, our legislators can focus the conversation on what our students and schools need. And there are indeed a lot of needs. 
We could use our legislative session to focus on the rising health care costs that strain school budgets. We could address the unsustainable rise in property taxes that are hurting Vermonters statewide. Or, we could discuss how to actually fund the school construction aid that was established in Act 73. 
We could use this new session to focus on putting nurses back in every school building, every day, or art and music teachers in all of our schools daily, or on hiring more social workers and therapists to respond to the ever growing mental health needs of our students. Many school districts passed budgets in 2024 and 2025 that cut many staff positions and are likely preparing for another round of barebones budgets.
We could use our upcoming session to address our statewide teacher shortage and invest time and money in expanding our grow-your-own initiatives and our support for new teachers. 
Or, we could focus our attention back on ensuring that public funds go to public schools that serve all students and follow state guidelines. Rather than provide vouchers for some, we could strengthen our public schools for all. 
There’s a lot of work to be done in our state. Hopefully, the stance of the task force will give other legislators in Montpelier courage to do right for public schools: to listen to teachers, to listen to students and to listen to community members who demand strong public schools.
Our public schools are our bedrock to our democracy; let’s focus on building them up, not tearing them down, this new legislative season.

Dec. 4, 2025 | Photo by Ben Solis/Michigan AdvanceAs Gwynne Wilcox awaits a court ruling to determine if President Donald Trump had the power to remove her from the National Labor Relations Board, the tireless labor advocate returned to Detroit last week with a hero’s reception.
Wilcox was the first Black woman to serve on the board since its inception. She was also the first person to be removed from the board by a sitting president in its 90-year existence. She is now suing the Trump administration over that decision, and the case is pending before the U.S. Supreme Court after a stay was issued by Chief Justice John Roberts. The lower courts have largely rejected Trump’s effort to remove her.
On Thursday, Wilcox headlined Sugar Law Center’s annual “Essential Advocacy: For Economic & Social Justice” dinner and speaker event. The night included an address from Lt. Gov. Garlin Gilchrist and was attended by U.S. Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Detroit). 
Wilcox also received the firm’s essential advocacy honor. It was a full circle moment for Wilcox, who at one time was a board member to the nonprofit which is dedicated to providing advocacy and support to poor and working people facing societal challenges.
Wilcox said the work of advocates that tell the stories of working people, much like Sugar Law Center, was indeed essential to upholding the nation’s constitutional freedoms – especially in the era of Trump.

“The impact of the decisions made by the administration have really changed the National Labor Relations board’s ability to do the work that it’s doing,” Wilcox said. “So needless to say … the work that you all are doing is so, so important. We don’t know what’s going to happen with the National Labor Relations Board, but you have been surviving for so many, many years, doing excellent work. Workers need you. Our communities need you. Their families need you to continue doing the work.”
For Wilcox, it was just another feather in her cap after a long distinguished career of fighting for worker’s rights. Prior to her appointment to the National Labor Relations Board, Wilcox was a senior partner at the Levy Ratner law firm in New York, serving as the associate general counsel for  SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, and a labor representative to the New York City Office of Collective Bargaining. 
She’s also been a board member for various labor advocacy and legal groups, including the AFL-CIO Lawyers Coordinating Committee, now known as the Union Lawyers Alliance.
John Philo, the executive and legal director of the Sugar Law Center, told Michigan Advance that honoring Wilcox as she continues her fight against the Trump administration meant a great deal to the organization.










The president cannot remove someone who has not been alleged to have engaged in any type of negligence nor any type of cause. They never pretended to even allege that there was any cause.

“It’s the living struggle that’s happening right now between those who believe in rule of law and those who believe strictly in power. And she is at the pivot point of that,” Philo said. “What’s happened to her through the actions of the president really is going to define our country. Do we believe in the rule of law, and do we believe that the president is restrained by a Constitution? Or are we going in a much different and much dangerous direction?”

Wilcox was nominated by former President Joe Biden and served a first term on the National Labor Relations Board from August 2021 until August 2023. She served as the board’s chair after she was renominated by Biden in 2023, until she was ultimately removed by Trump shortly after he returned to office in January of this year.
Her term was meant to go through 2028. Wilcox was one of two board members dismissed by Trump this year, as Jennifer Abruzzo was also removed from the powerful labor board. The firings essentially nullified the three-person board because it now lacks a quorum to decide labor cases that have come before it over the last century.
Wilcox sued the Trump administration and the board’s new chair, Marvin Kaplan, in February, filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.
U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell of the District of Columbia ruled in March that Trump had violated the National Labor Relations Act, and ordered that Wilcox would remain a member.
A three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel overturned that decision, but when the appellate court heard the matter again en banc, which means before the entire U.S. Court of Appeals D.C. Circuit bench, the court ruled 7-4 to block Wilcox’s termination.
The matter is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court on a stay issued by Roberts.
Wilcox discussed her struggle against Trump and the difficulties therein while speaking to a rapt crowd at the Sugar Law Center event.
“I knew that I had to fight because the board, both the statute and the Supreme Court have said, they’re an independent agency,” Wilcox said. “The board is supposed to exist, and the president cannot remove someone who has not been alleged to have engaged in any type of negligence nor any type of cause. They never pretended to even allege that there was any cause.”
Wilcox said that the Trump administration’s firing of her and Abruzzo exposed that the administration didn’t really fully understand the board’s role or what the members of the board did.
“Sometimes I was called commissioner, sometimes she was considered a board member, but (the letter said) she made decisions,” Wilcox said. “It was poorly written.”

In all, Wilcox said the lawsuit wasn’t about trying to get her job back – it was about the important fight for the autonomy of a key independent federal agency.
“(The board) has been in existence since 1935, and it protects the rights of workers,” she said. “It’s not a neutral statute, the statute that’s there to protect workers. And so I felt very clear about that. … I believe in the rule of law.”
Although the ultimate decision over Trump’s authority rests with a U.S. Supreme Court majority that has shown a willingness to appease the president’s legal overreaches, Wilcox said the work that advocates like Sugar Law Center and others do to uplift the stories of workers was paramount to the cause and maintaining American freedoms.
Philo echoed the same sentiment, and called Wilcox a shining example of that effort.
“We will fight. We will fight it now. We’ll fight it tomorrow, and we’ll fight it the day after tomorrow. We may lose a few of those battles, but we’re not going back to a country that doesn’t have a Constitution, a country that doesn’t believe in equality or the rule of law,” Philo said. “We may lose battles, but we’re not going to lose this at the end of the day. (The American people) are a decent people, and they are going to embrace our Constitution, embrace democracy, embrace, really, equality for everybody.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/PC046413-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)About a quarter of Indiana Republican senators have not yet said how they’ll vote on a sweeping partisan redraw of the state’s congressional maps, teeing up an uncertain week for the proposal’s future.
The Senate will reconvene Monday afternoon to begin consideration of House Bill 1032, after reversing an earlier decision not to meet.
The redesign would likely eliminate Indiana’s two Democratic-held congressional districts to create a 9-0 Republican map ahead of the 2026 midterm election, as sought by President Donald Trump.
The House approved the redistricting bill Friday, as expected, on a vote of 57-41. Twelve Republicans joined all Democrats present in opposition.
But Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray has warned there are “not enough votes to move that idea forward.” He didn’t return multiple interview requests on how the proposal’s prospects may have changed in recent weeks.
Indiana’s Constitution requires a majority of the 50-member Senate to approve legislation. That means the 40-strong Republican supermajority must muster at least 26 votes to pass the bill if all 10 Democrats oppose. GOP Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith can break a 25-25 tie.
Indiana House approves redistricting bill, sending issue to state Senate

Sixteen Senate Republicans have publicly come out in favor of a redraw — some more enthusiastically than others. Another 14 are against.
The latest senator to indicate firm opposition is Sen. Mike Crider, R-Greenfield.
“I think the maps are pretty alarming, actually. So I was a no before, and I’m for sure a no now,” he told the Capital Chronicle. “I mean, I just think that if those maps pass, there’s a good possibility that three or four millionaires from Indianapolis will represent a third of the state, so I don’t know that that serves us well.”
In the current congressional maps, drawn in 2021, Republicans maintained a 7-2 GOP advantage. Democratic Rep. Frank Mrvan holds the 1st District in northwest Indiana, while Democratic Rep. André Carson holds the 7th District in Indianapolis.
The House Republican proposal would break up the Lake Michigan shoreline area into two districts and splinter Indianapolis across four far-reaching districts — three of which hit borders with other states.
“I can tell you, from experience, it’s kind of difficult to have totally urban areas and totally rural areas where the constituents are thinking and talking about completely different things,” Crider said.
“For instance, in Hancock County and Shelby County, they never talked about mass transit, and that’s what they wanted to talk about in Irvington. And so, I mean, it’s a stretch,” he said. “And then, if you take that stretch and magnify it from, you know, the south side of Indianapolis to the Ohio River, I’m not sure how that’s even workable. I guess I don’t know how you come up with the map that does that.”
The positions of 10 others remain unknown, even though the first Senate-side votes could be cast as early as Monday afternoon.
That’s when the Elections Committee is scheduled to hear the proposal — and from constituents.
Committee math
Sen. Mike Gaskill, R-Pendleton, promised to “foster a civil debate as we review this bill,” in a Friday statement. He chairs the nine-member committee and is the Senate sponsor of the House-originated legislation.
Gaskill, plus GOP Sens. Tyler Johnson of Leo and Daryl Schmitt of Jasper, support redistricting. But fellow Sen. Greg Walker of Columbus, who isn’t running for reelection, has come out against the idea.
Two committee Democrats are expected to vote in opposition, while three other Republicans are undecided or have declined to comment.
Story continues below.

Sen. Linda Rogers, R-LaGrange, said she’s “going back and forth, listening to constituents” throughout “lots of” phone calls and emails, as well as testimony from the House’s single public hearing last week.
“I will be in the elections committee, so until I at least hear all the testimony I don’t like to have made my decision,” Rogers told the Capital Chronicle. She noted “there are so many ramifications on both sides.”
Sen. Greg Goode, R-Terre Haute, previously said he wanted to see the maps — which have since been released — before making a decision. Goode didn’t reply to multiple requests for comment on his stance.
Sen. Stacey Donato, R-Logansport, said, “I don’t have any comment for you at this time,” when reached by phone Wednesday.
If the redistricting bill advances from first reading in committee, it would head to the chamber floor for amendments on Wednesday. After it’s engrossed, the proposal would go up for a full Senate vote on Thursday.
‘Whatever happens, happens’
It’s unclear how the bill will fare outside the committee room, too.
Sen. Aaron Freeman, R-Indianapolis, said Wednesday that he had seen the maps but hadn’t yet read the details of the bill: “You’re not going to get me to commit to something that I haven’t read.”
But, he noted, the legislation goes beyond redrawing boundaries.
“I understand there’s, you know, dates in there and all the things of, you know, people can’t sue. I mean, there’s all kinds of things in there that are unrelated to a map that I have to review,” said Freeman, who is also an attorney. “So I’ll do so, and I’ll be ready to go.”
House Bill 1032 would prohibit seeking or granting temporary injunctions against it, and gives the Indiana Supreme Court “exclusive” jurisdiction over any appeal of an order promoting an injunction.
“That part, in particular, might be a little flag for them in terms of how (unsure senators) view this,” said Laura Merrifield Wilson, a political science professor at the University of Indianapolis.

Sen. Brian Buchanan — who spoke to the Capital Chronicle during a brief dally on the sidelines of a pro-redistricting rally at the Statehouse on Friday — declined to comment on his stance or announcement timeline.
Others didn’t reply to requests for comment, including:

Republican Sens. Dan Dernulc of Highland and Rick Niemeyer of Lowell told the Capital Chronicle last month, during the ceremonial first day of the legislative session, that they wanted to see the maps before deciding. It’s unclear what they think of the released draft.
Sen. Cyndi Carrasco, R-Indianapolis, said last month that she’d made a decision. When asked to share it, she replied, “Maybe later.”
Sens. Ed Charbonneau of Valparaiso and Ryan Mishler of Fishers have been publicly noncommittal.

“We also, to my knowledge, have not heard more statements from some of the ‘question-mark’ senators,” Wilson, the professor, observed.
“I kind of wonder if … there’s been movement that we don’t know,” she said, like if senators are “not being forthright with the information of whether or not they have changed or made a decision.”
Wilson said that silence could set up a shock result, if “enough people silently vote in support, having never gone on the record … before.”
Or, it could go the other way. When asked Friday what’s next if the Senate rejects the redistricting bill, Huston told reporters: “Look, it’s been a long week. We’ll deal with it. Whatever happens, happens.”
Cranking up the pressure
Indiana Gov. Mike Braun, who appeared at the pro-redistricting rally on Friday, was more aggressive. He again threatened to support primary competition for fellow Republicans who oppose redistricting.
The bill’s failure in the Senate, he said, “means you’re gonna have to clean house to get real conservatives in.”
Braun first echoed Trump’s primary ultimatum last month, after the president posted that Braun “perhaps, is not working the way he should to get the necessary Votes” — and later, that he “must produce” on redistricting.

Rally attendees were repeatedly encouraged to contact their senators — including at stations upstairs by the Senate’s Republican and Democratic entrances. Constituents could leave handwritten messages there.
“I’m down here to break the one-party rule in Marion County,” said Lawrence Township resident Adam Harvey. “Currently, André Carson’s my congressman, and he doesn’t represent me at all.”
The rally drew a crowd of a couple hundred. Some traveled from further afield.
“The state is 60% Republican. We’ve got 80% of the House and the Senate. There’s no reason why we shouldn’t do this,” said Robert Hall, who drove about 90 miles from Mitchell.
Some redistricting opponents argue all-GOP congressional representation isn’t fair when Indiana has typically voted for Trump and others on a 60-40 split. But, Hall said, “What if each of those nine districts were 60-40? That’s what the state is.”
He, like numerous others, cited partisan redistricting efforts in Democratic-controlled states.
The pro-redistricting rally came days after hundreds of Hoosiers packed the Statehouse’s third floor to protest the redistricting plan. Their chants echoed throughout the building, audible even through the doors into the House chamber, as lawmakers plodded through proceedings.
Linda Butler of Lawrence in northeastern Marion County was among the protesters.
“They’re doing it so that they can win elections,” Butler said then, about Indiana Republicans. “It is terrible. I think it’s terrible. That’s an illustration for me that this is wrong.”
State police adjust Statehouse security
At least a dozen legislators, largely Senate Republicans, have publicly disclosed being targeted in swatting attempts, bomb threats and more — prompting an ongoing investigation now led by the Indiana State Police.
That number doesn’t include similar incidents involving local officials, such as Indianapolis City-County Councilor Nick Roberts, according to ISP spokesman Ron Galaviz.
The threats have varied but appear to share a common aim: triggering significant law enforcement responses.
In mid-November, GOP Sen. Andy Zay reported that a bomb threat was emailed to his family’s Huntington vehicle rental business, prompting officers to temporarily block off the area while they investigated.
The threat came shortly after a procedural vote on when the Senate would reconvene. Zay had voted to keep the chamber in session instead of returning in January, which was widely interpreted as support for coming back and addressing redistricting sooner.
“At this point, I’m voting for it,” he told the Capital Chronicle on Wednesday. But, he said, “I would like to see the maps change. … I’m hoping we can make them better” in the Senate.
Constituents could write directly to their senators — about redistricting or otherwise — at stations set up outside the Senate chamber at the Indiana Statehouse on Friday, Dec. 5, 2025. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
Asked what edits he’d like to make, Zay quipped, “We don’t have enough time on this phone call.” He said the maps “changed a lot more dramatically than I thought they would.”
Several other lawmakers have also disclosed fake reports had been made to police about violent incidents at their homes — including what officials described as attempts at “swatting.”
Swatting typically involves someone falsely reporting an emergency, such as a shooting or hostage situation, in an effort to prompt an armed law enforcement response to an unsuspecting person’s home.
Although some incidents prompted only small responses — “maybe about a handful of officers,” Galaviz said of the first Terre Haute call to Goode’s residence — officials have stressed that the intent behind the calls appears consistent with swatting.
Galaviz said none of the recent episodes resulted in what police would consider a “large police response.” He emphasized that local agencies “are responding seriously,” while also taking “an extra moment of pause” because they know similar hoaxes are occurring across the state.
State police are routing all reports through the Indiana Intelligence Fusion Center as part of one overarching investigation.
Galaviz said ISP has not made any arrests and declined to discuss investigative specifics. But the work “can take some time.”
The “volume of reports” and the high-profile nature of the alleged targets require “thorough, accurate, deep-diving investigations” that could ultimately result in state or federal prosecutions, per Galaviz.
Security protocols at the Statehouse have been adjusted, too, although Galaviz declined to provide details. He said ISP is “well aware” of the ongoing threats and has updated plans ahead of lawmakers’ return to Indianapolis. Local law enforcement agencies may also have their own protective measures in place for targeted officials.
Galaviz urged the public to continue sending any relevant information to the Fusion Center and said ISP will release updates — particularly if an arrest is made — but won’t disclose details prematurely.
“We’re not going to jeopardize our case just because one of your subscribers wants to know,” he said. “It’ll come out sooner or later. We just want it to come out at the appropriate time.”

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)California in September became the first state to ban law enforcement officers from wearing face coverings, in response to immigration raids where federal agents wore masks. 
The U.S. Department of Justice sued the state over the prohibition last month.
Democratic lawmakers here in Washington are now planning similar legislation.
Washington’s proposal, spearheaded by Sen. Javier Valdez, D-Seattle, and Rep. Julio Cortes, D-Everett, resembles California’s law. 
The Trump administration says the California policy jeopardizes the safety of federal officers, including those from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and is unconstitutional because it tries to regulate federal activities.
Legislators in other states, including Virginia, Illinois and Michigan, have proposed similar restrictions. Connecticut has prohibited authorities from wearing face coverings inside state courthouses, with limited exceptions.
Cortes hopes the legislation would build community trust in law enforcement and hold police accountable. 
“Trust is essential for crime reporting. When folks trust their local law enforcement, they are going to be reporting more crime,” he said Thursday. “When we see ICE out there, when those masked agents are out in communities, they create fear and intimidation, and that discourages community members from interacting with any law enforcement, even when they need help themselves.”
Cortes sees the proposed policy as consistent with existing state law requiring officers to be “reasonably identifiable,” meaning that their uniform displays their name and other information.
The bill would have some exemptions, like for undercover operations, or if officers need to wear protective gear such as gas masks or motorcycle helmets.
In an April raid at a Bellingham roofing company, dozens of ICE agents donned masks when they arrested 37 workers accused of being in the country without legal status.
Steve Strachan, executive director for the Washington Association of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, declined to comment on the substance of the bill, but said he’s had a “very productive” discussion about it with Cortes and Valdez. 
“We remain hopeful that these conversations will be ongoing and result with a proposal that we can all support,” Strachan said in a statement. 
Valdez said it’s fair to say that law enforcement is “not excited about the bill.”
The Legislature convenes in January for a 60-day session. Both the House and Senate will need to pass the bill before it can get to the governor’s desk.
The potential legal battle that could ensue if the bill becomes law doesn’t discourage Cortes. 
“That’s maybe a bridge that we’ll cross when we get there,” he said, adding that the focus now is to make “our community understand that we are here with them, and we are here to support them, and we are here to keep them safe.”
Attorney General Nick Brown said his office is monitoring the bill. 

SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE 
The bill will make clear that if the courts nullify California’s law, then Washington’s law, if passed, would remain on the books, but only apply to state and local law enforcement, not federal, Valdez said.
Congressional Democrats have filed bills focused on federal agents, including ICE, but the measures have little chance of success in the Republican-controlled Congress.
Next year, Washington state lawmakers will also consider a bill championed by Brown to protect immigrant workers. The Immigrant Worker Protection Act would require employers to notify their employees of a planned inspection of employment eligibility paperwork within 72 hours of being notified about it by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/immigration-agents-portland-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)When a Colorado woman was accused of being a porch pirate, police were certain they had the right person. After all, it was caught on camera — specifically, on automatic license plate readers. She found herself having to painstakingly comb through her life to demonstrate that she couldn’t have been the one who committed the crime — she wasn’t even in the area at the time. After police dropped the charges, she told a news station, “It became my job to prove my innocence. And I thought it was supposed to be the other way around.”
She is, of course, correct. In fact, she articulated a core principle of the American justice system: we are innocent until proven guilty. Because of this, the government should not invade our privacy just in case we do something illegal. But law enforcement agencies are increasingly using license plate readers for mass location tracking and surveillance of everyone — not just those suspected of a crime. 
Indiana lawmakers want to crack down on data privacy. What about license plate readers?

A retired veteran in Virginia filed a lawsuit to find out just how often the readers were tracking him. The result? They logged his location 526 times in just over four months — about four times every single day. 
In most areas of the country, including Indiana, the data collected by the readers can be stored indefinitely with few, if any, meaningful privacy protections. Think of the implications. These records could be used to reveal incredibly personal and sensitive information: whether a person attended an AA meeting, a political rally, a church service, the office of a physician who specializes in a specific type of disease — the list is never-ending. 
This isn’t mere speculation. In fact, there have already been numerous instances across the country of abuse – including cases where members of law enforcement used the systems to track the whereabouts of estranged partners and exes. While the vast majority of officers would never misuse a tool like this, even a single violation of someone’s privacy is unacceptable and undermines public trust. 
The privacy concerns around license plate readers don’t stop at city or county lines. Some systems, like Flock, are used across the country and around the world. This means law enforcement in other states, and even countries, can access Hoosiers’ data, turning a supposedly local safety tool into potential cross-border surveillance that people never agreed to and can’t reasonably opt out of. 
Indiana lawmakers should institute reasonable guardrails on the use of the technology. This includes requiring that the records of people who are not suspected of any crime be deleted within a short period — days or weeks at most. Regulations should also ensure that law enforcement agencies can’t use databases from private companies that have inadequate privacy policies.  
License plate readers can be a helpful tool when used for narrowly tailored purposes, such as toll enforcement or identifying vehicles that are stolen or involved in a serious crime. But lawmakers must balance the use of this technology with the privacy rights of Hoosiers. If you wouldn’t be ok with the government installing GPS on your car to track your every move, you shouldn’t be ok with the unregulated use of these readers either.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2157492329-1024x678.jpg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

Biking from Springfield to Mountain Home, Arkansas, where he’d planned to stay with a friend, Chiasson, 52, was pulled over and arrested on a warrant for a stolen car — charges that were eventually dropped.
While fighting the charges, Chiasson said, he got into a cycle of “using, stressing,” failing drug tests at his court appearances and then “hav[ing] to go do seven days in jail.” 
He was in jail when another inmate told him about the Action Recovery Center, a Christian sober living house in Gainesville. The residential program promised to help residents with substance use disorders find stability through faith, work and peer support.
Chiasson became one of about 20 Missourians who have graduated from Action Recovery Center’s nine-month program since it opened in November 2023. It’s one of a spate of faith-based sober living houses established by Christians in recovery from substance use disorders in Wright, Ozark, Douglas and Texas counties.
Jerry Chiasson reflects on his time as a resident and mentor at Action Recovery Center in Gainesville (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
They’ve emerged outside Missouri’s regulatory structures for recovery houses in a part of the state where treatment and services for people battling substance use disorders are scarce. There are 3,677 accredited beds in the state, and 44% of them are located in St. Louis or Kansas City. There are no accredited beds in Ozark County, where Action Recovery Center is located.
While these unaccredited recovery houses meet a need in communities where treatment options are limited or nonexistent, they raise concerns that a lack of any oversight could hinder their effectiveness or lead to abuse.
“These things are popping up all over,” said Judge Craig Carter, presiding judge in the 44th circuit, which spans Ozark, Wright and Douglas counties. “And they give a lot of people who otherwise could not get it, they give them a second chance.”
Carter said that while he has a working relationship with recovery houses like Action Recovery Center and Mountain Moving Ministry in Wright County, he doesn’t always know what to expect from new houses farther afield.
“If I send someone all the way down to Butler County, I need to know that they’re going to communicate with me and that they’re above board,” Carter said.

Recovery houses in Missouri are not required to undergo any certification process to open their doors. But in order to receive state or federal funding disbursed by the Missouri Department of Mental Health, they must be accredited by the Missouri Coalition of Recovery Support Providers. 
The coalition accredits recovery houses using standards established by the National Alliance of Recovery Residences. The standards cover residents’ rights, building safety and the houses’ relationship with neighbors, and after initial accreditation, the coalition visits houses every two years to ensure they still meet all requirements.
Merna Eppick, director of the coalition’s housing committee, said the aim of accreditation is to strengthen support for residents of these recovery houses.
“We try hard to help you become better,” Eppick said. “Our goal is, even if you’ve got 20 deficiencies, you’ve got 90 days to fix it. We revisit it and say, ‘Yay, you did a great job. You’re accredited.’ We want to help all of us be better.” 
But Action Recovery Center — and a handful of other recovery houses in southern Missouri — are not seeking accreditation. 
Ken Polm, founder of Big Boy Men’s Ministry in Cabool, said he doesn’t pursue state funding because he is concerned the money would come with requirements that could sideline residents’ spiritual development.
“If we receive state funding,” Polm said, “a lot of times, we’re not allowed to make it all about Christ. We get limited to what we can actually do, as far as the type of classes.”
For Polm, the biggest issue with accreditation relates to medication-assisted treatment. He and other leaders of faith-based sober living homes told The Independent that they worry taking medications like methadone or buprenorphine to beat an opioid addiction sets people up to relapse.
Decades of research have shown that methadone and buprenorphine taken as “maintenance” medications, for months or years, sharply reduce overdose deaths by 50 to 70%.
Recovery houses don’t have to accept medication-assisted treatment to be accredited or receive state funding. But they do if they want any federal funds through the U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.
 To fish for a man

On a Tuesday evening in late October, 15 to 20 men spill from the living room to the kitchen of an old house in Cabool, with a couple of people poring over Bibles in an adjoining room. 
It’s one of two homes to Big Boy Men’s Ministry. 
There are at least four bedrooms filled with the stuff of the men’s lives: family photos taped to the wall, backpacks, laundry hampers clustered around bunk beds set up dorm-style. Polm is rushing to get to a revival, and he’s trying to round up residents who want to come. Others stay to socialize, with hugs and gentle ribbing among men who have become brothers.
Polm said he began his ministry to men struggling with addiction while he was on probation. He’d strike up conversations when he reported to the probation office.
Chiasson wrote the mission statement for Action Recovery House after becoming house leader. “Those words just poured out of my heart,” he said  (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
“Just through conversation, you could tell that they were trying to have a new life, but they didn’t know how to have it,” Polm said. “So I would basically start there. Then after that, even when it wasn’t my visit to see the probation officer, I would still attend the office, just to go in there and sit and fish for a man.”
Polm said he and his wife, April, were “blessed…with a very big house.” So they started welcoming men to live in their 3,200-square-foot basement. Big Boy Men’s Ministry now spans two houses, and April started a recovery housing ministry for women called Abundant Grace.
“Me and my wife, we really enjoy it,” Polm said. “Because downstairs, when the guys are down there and they’re being rowdy, laughing and just carrying on with each other, being brothers with one another…being able to be partakers of that experience is so rewarding.”
The men work during the day and attend evening classes four to five times a week. Saturday is laundry and shopping day, Polm said, and from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., they volunteer in the community, building decks, repairing roofs, washing windows, cleaning gutters, “just all kinds of stuff.”
Once a month, the men hold “street church” and share their testimony with the public.
“Either myself or the other men from the ministry that’s been raised up from discipleship to be preachers, they get to be up there preaching the word of God, and we do altar calls,” Polm said. “So we’re very involved on the weekends in our community.”
The men pay $150 per week after their first two weeks, and the ministry accepts donations. 
In late October, there were around 20 men in each of the Polms’ houses. Polm said 50 to 60 men graduate from the ministry each year, and that he and his wife counsel residents like parents. 
“I sit them down as men, and I have these hard talks with them like a father would give them, and I give them the best advice that I can come up with,” he said. “And my wife does the same thing. It’s pretty fascinating and such a joy to experience this, that some of the men will even come to my wife and say, ‘Hey Mom, can we talk?’ They’re having wife problems, or they’re having children problems.”
Dayton Austin, 28, of West Plains, said Polm has been talking to him “man to man” since the first time he got in trouble in 2019, even when he slipped up.
He did his first recovery housing program at Mountain Moving Ministry in Mountain Grove, Austin said, where Polm is board president. 
He graduated from the program and “made all the right moves, did all the right hoops, said all the right words,” but got another charge within six months.
Austin kept graduating from recovery housing programs and getting in trouble, he said, selling fentanyl and “just being crazy.” He had periods of success, too, studying for a few years to be an occupational therapy assistant in Springfield.
“I was doing the thing, without people having to tell me what to do,” Austin said.
Dayton Austin looks to the future in the kitchen of Big Boy Men’s Ministry in Cabool (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
He loved his studies, he said, but they were stressful and he returned to old patterns. He got caught with meth and a gun. 
Polm told him to just show up at Big Boy Men’s Ministry.
“I had a feeling I was destined for prison,” Austin said, “but I knew I needed to be here before I went.” 
Five months into his stay, Austin was sent to prison for eight months. But, he said, “I had a foundation to go to prison on now.” 
After his release this year, Austin returned to Cabool.
He looks up to the ministry’s growing group of graduates. Some of them have become part of the ministry’s leadership.
“All these guys are on the board now, that God’s really using,” Austin said. “He gave them businesses. They’re busting with kids. They’re busting with families. … They’re creating their own ministries.”
Austin, who is now a certified nursing assistant, said he hopes for a family of his own someday. 
“It’s all a process,” he said, “but I know what I want.”
 Grassroots standards

It’s a busy November morning at the Wright County Courthouse in Hartville, with almost 70 people on the criminal docket.
Chris Turner, 48, of West Plains, is the first to be called before the judge. 
Turner, who was found guilty of burglary and meth possession in April, was called to court for a probation violation hearing because she hadn’t been making her restitution payments. But she was able to satisfy Judge Craig Carter that she’s making progress.
She’s settled up with the county. And in June she moved into a Christian sober living house in West Plains called Design Your Life.
The women’s recovery house was established in September 2024. Carter said he had never heard of it.
“I can honestly say it’s the best thing that’s happened to me since I got in trouble,” Turner told The Independent.
Before she joined Design Your Life, Turner said she was facing homelessness and struggling to find transportation to her drug tests. She said she used to walk the 43 miles from West Plains to Mountain Grove. 
Now she gets transportation to court and her job at a sawmill from Design Your Life. And living in a house full of women is coaxing her out of her shell, she said.
Carter said he is a strong supporter of Christian sober living houses.
But he said there’s a need for shared expectations between sober living houses and the courts when completion of a recovery housing program is a condition of a defendant’s bond or probation. He said communication and fair, consistent drug testing are two of the most important areas for agreement.
Judges can’t unilaterally force a defendant to participate in a religious program, Carter said. But if a defendant applies to a Christian sober living house and is accepted, it can help make the case against keeping them in jail or sending them to prison.
“We’ve sent people to some of the ones in Springfield,” Carter said, “and guys will run, and they won’t let us know. We’ll have them back on the docket in two months. Where is this person?”
Autumn Dulaney, 42, of Isabella, outside of Action Recovery Center in Gainesville. Since finishing the program last year, she and her husband have saved enough money to move out of their camper into a house, and she’s mending her relationships with her children. “I couldn’t have done it without Jesus,” she said (Steph Quinn/Missouri Independent).
Wright County Prosecutor John Tyrrell said he is concerned a lack of standardization can allow abuse of residents.
He gave the example of Compassion House in Niangua. The facility’s founder, Isaac Tilden, was charged this year with child abuse and forced labor. The complaints allege that Tilden compelled residents to work for free or face revocation of probation or parole, and that he failed to protect his daughter from sexual abuse by residents.
Accreditation provides standards and protections for recovery house residents, but accredited recovery beds are scarce in some parts of the state.
Shawn Wilkerson, who is spearheading plans to expand Mountain Moving Ministry to Ava, said he and a friend spent 10 hours trying to find a spot for him in treatment when he embarked on his recovery journey five years ago.
“The guy said, ‘Well, it going to be a year,” Wilkerson said. “I said, ‘Well, in a year I’ll either be in prison or dead.”
Howell County, where Turner and Austin are from, has only 18 of the state’s 3,677 accredited recovery beds. Texas County, where Polm runs his two recovery houses, has one accredited house with 22 beds.
Springfield and Branson have a combined 641 beds, but each is over an hour away from Gainesville or Mountain Grove. And transportation is a challenge in this rural part of the state.
Sober living houses typically transport residents to and from work and court.
“Twenty guys in a house, and they all have different court dates,” Carter said. “And in different counties…. They just drive the tires off.”
Tyrrell said he’s leery of state oversight but suggested that judges, prosecutors and attorneys gather on a circuit level to set expectations for recovery houses.
“I need to know that the programs understand that these are court orders, and court orders have to be complied with,” Tyrrell said.
Wilkerson said leaders of the residences and the courts should work locally to share best practices.
“We need to build — and I think this is where we’re at working on it — building a baseline portfolio to where I could sit down with a prosecutor in Greene County, open up a portfolio and say, ‘This is what we do, why we do it, how we do it,” Wilkerson said.
Tyrrell said the recovery houses the court works with often share information that helps him make decisions about defendants’ cases. 
“I can go talk to the director,” Tyrrell said, “and say, ‘Hey, tell me about this person. What’s he like? Is there something I need to know?’ And they’ll be honest with you. That helps.”
Jayson Jackson, 27, said he was about to be sent to prison for 10 years after absconding from probation when he told the prosecuting attorney on his case that he was going to Big Boy Men’s Ministry. Because the prosecutor and judge were familiar with Polm’s recovery house, they agreed to give him a chance.
“I go, ‘God sent me a piece of paper telling me I’m going to Big Boy,” Jackson said. “So unless you [or that judge] have got more authority than God, I know I’m not [going to prison].”

Jackson said he had been trying to break into an abandoned house in Willow Springs while on the lam when he encountered God. He had fallen to his knees on the side of a road and prayed. Then, he said, a piece of paper hit him in the face. 
It was an advertisement for a new sandwich from Dairy Queen, Jackson said. On the other side, someone had written down Polm’s phone number.
Jackson said he’s been sober for 3 years. Now he travels around the state with Polm, preaching, and he works at a sawmill.
“I throw logs for a living,” Jackson said. “They come in, roll them down the log deck, chop them all up and I stack them.”
Jackson said the hard work has been worth it.
“It’s cold, and it’s wet,” he said. “But I wouldn’t trade the life that I live right now for the whole world.”",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_3273-1024x614.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 07:57:23.749582

Addison County State’s Attorney Eva Vekos’ conduct has prompted two formal ethics complaints. One advocate called her behavior “unacceptable and deeply concerning.”
Read the story on VTDigger here:  These Vermont sexual assault survivors sought justice. Instead, one victim said the prosecutor’s approach was “like a ‘screw you’”.","A Bristol small business owner said she hoped she and her 15-year-old daughter would be treated respectfully when they pursued a criminal complaint against the teenager who sexually assaulted her daughter. 
Instead, the business owner says she was sworn at by Eva Vekos, the embattled state’s attorney in Addison County. State’s attorneys are elected in every county in Vermont to lead the office that works with police and sheriffs departments to prosecute cases in court. 
“Her general attitude toward victims is so derogatory,” the business owner said of Vekos. She filed a formal ethics complaint against Vekos, whose troubles have piled up since she was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol nearly two years ago. 
Because of how the business owner and three other crime victims say Vekos handled their cases, they felt invalidated, belittled and demeaned. In three of these cases, the victims said Vekos denied them the opportunity to give meaningful input on plea deals she was negotiating with the defense on the sentences their offenders would face. It was “kind of like a ‘screw you’ situation,” said a college student from Vermont who was a victim in a sexual assault case. 
Martha Bowdish, a victim advocate at Addison County Unit for Special Investigations, which investigates sex crimes, has also filed a formal ethics complaint about Vekos with the state Professional Responsibility Board, which handles allegations of attorney misconduct.
The board of Atria Collective, a Middlebury organization that worked closely with Vekos’ office, also raised concern, saying, in a statement to media, that staff has witnessed “countless instances” of victims’ rights being violated during Vekos’ time in office.
“In case after case, our agency has observed, State’s Attorney Vekos neglecting to prioritize both the safety of victims and survivors and the well-being of the community,” Atria Collective’s board of directors wrote.

Vekos’ tumultuous relationship with victims and their advocates came to light after she was charged with driving under the influence of alcohol when she allegedly appeared intoxicated at a suspicious death investigation in January 2024. 
The state investigated a medical leave she took soon after the DUI charge. Then it temporarily suspended her law license. A judge declined to throw out her case. In the fall, her attorney pushed for a deal that could allow the charge to be cleared from her record. Her next court date is set for Dec. 16. 
In spring 2024, lawmakers called for her resignation, but Vekos never stepped down. She is up for re-election in November of 2026.
Vekos declined multiple requests for an interview to discuss the complaints outlined in this story. She responded to some questions via email but declined to discuss others, saying she is constrained by privacy laws.

“I stand by the work done in every case handled by my office,” she wrote. 
“There is no State’s Attorney in Vermont—or prosecutor anywhere—who has been able to fulfill the wishes of every crime victim, ” she wrote, adding that prosecutors must weigh other factors like the strength of evidence and available resources. 
To be sure, prosecutors routinely weigh their chances of winning a conviction as they consider making plea deals. But victims and advocates who criticized Vekos argue she did not meaningfully consult with victims before agreeing to a case’s resolution and that she treated them egregiously. Two victims said the outcomes of their cases led them to fear for public safety. 
Vermont law states that crime victims “shall be treated with courtesy and sensitivity” by courts and prosecutors. To ensure victims receive support, state law also guarantees crime victims the right to a victim advocate, someone trained to walk victims through court processes.
Victims rights were adopted by Vermont and many other states in the 1980s in response to complaints from victims that they were left behind in overburdened criminal justice systems. The goal was to better support victims and create avenues for their voices to be heard in the legal system. 
Victim advocates are state employees who work in every county’s state’s attorneys office. In Vermont, they often handle about 600 cases each, about double the number recommended by a study often cited by state officials. In Addison County, staff from other organizations, including Bowdish and Jena Santa Maria, who directs advocacy for Atria Collective, have stepped in to help.
VTDigger has decided not to name these sexual assault victims or their families, and does not identify sexual assault victims without their consent. VTDigger also interviewed two people who work closely with Vekos’ office who spoke on the condition their names not be used in this story for fear of retaliation. 
‘She had a vendetta’ 
The Bristol small business owner helped her teenage daughter contact police in 2017 after she was sexually assaulted by a teenage boy who was also under the age of 16.

After police found probable cause, a deputy state’s attorney at the time, Rebecca Otey, filed charges against the teenager who assaulted the business owner’s daughter. He faced up to a life sentence, court documents show. 
He pleaded guilty to the charge in 2018 and avoided serving time in prison on the condition he take part in a program for youthful offenders, court documents show. 
He could remain in the youthful offender program if he made a “good faith effort at treatment” and did not commit a crime of violence, his plea agreement said. 
But court records show he lost his placement in the youthful offender program and was eventually arrested in 2023. By this time, he was a 21-year-old man. Juvenile court records, detailing his time in the program, are confidential. 
Vekos was now serving as Addison County’s state’s attorney. After spending most of her career as a defense attorney, often representing juveniles, she was elected to be the county’s top prosecutor in 2022. 
Vermont law gives crime victims the right to get timely notifications of their offender’s release. But in 2023, the man who sexually assaulted the business owner’s daughter was released from jail, court records show. Vekos did not give the business owner any notice, according to the business owner and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office. 
The business owner, in a private meeting with the state’s attorney, said she told Vekos she had violated her daughter’s rights. According to the business owner, Vekos responded, “This is fucking ridiculous. I don’t have time for this.” 
“That’s pretty much set the whole tone for that meeting, where she was just using profanity right and left,” the business owner said. “She was just so condescending and so arrogant,” she added later on. 
The business owner went on to report the profanities when she filed an ethics complaint against Vekos in 2024 with the state board that handles allegations of attorney misconduct. She shared that complaint with VTDigger.
After that meeting, things changed for her daughter’s case. “From that day on she didn’t like that I had called her out and she was gonna do everything she could to make sure that he wasn’t prosecuted,” the business owner said. 
“I would go that far, to say that she had a vendetta and like she was going to prove to me that she could do what she wanted and screw the victims,” the business owner said. 
“Vekos believes she is above the law,” the business owner wrote in her ethics complaint. 
Vekos didn’t address this claim directly when asked to respond to a list of complaints. 
In February, Vekos agreed to give a six-year deferred sentence to the man convicted for his original sexual assault charge from 2017, court documents show. If he followed his conditions of probation for those years, he would then have a clean record. 
The business owner said she considered that possibility “very very dangerous.”
The business owner wrote in her ethics complaint that Vekos violated her and her daughter’s rights by entering into the deferred sentence agreement with the defense before consulting her. A person who works closely with the cases in Vekos’ office confirmed that the business owner and her daughter were not consulted. 
In conversations with the business owner, Vekos did not know basic facts about the case and admitted she did not have time to read the entire file, the business owner wrote in her ethics complaint. The complaint is still pending before the state’s attorney misconduct board. 
A few months later, this June, the man was cited for violating his probation conditions by moving to a different part of the state, according to court documents. Typically, when someone convicted of a crime violates their probation conditions, the person is sentenced after they admit to the violation in court. In this case, the man could have seen up to life in prison on his original charge. 
Instead, Vekos dropped the violation of probation he was facing this summer, court documents show. That was despite the business owner’s insistence that Vekos prosecute the violation, the business owner said. The man was able to continue serving his years of probation outside of jail. 
“I have zero faith in the Addison County court system because of Eva. Like, zero faith,” the business owner said, using Vekos’ first name. “Every time I go to court, I always expect the worst. Always. Because that’s probably what’s going to happen.”
Vekos, asked to respond to the business owner’s complaints, said she could not do so for confidentiality reasons. In an email, she said: “My office is dedicated to supporting crime victims in all cases, which we do every day.”
Complaints of retaliation
After advocates for the Middlebury special investigations unit and Atria Collective complained about Vekos’ behavior, Vekos largely declined to communicate with them, surfacing concerns that victims weren’t being served.
“Eva Vekos has instructed her staff not to communicate with my organization,” Santa Maria, the advocacy director for Atria Collective, wrote in an email in May. She called Vekos’ behavior an example of retaliation. 
In that email, Santa Maria said, Vekos’ behavior “violates the spirit, if not the letter, of Vermont’s victims’ rights laws.” 
Similarly, after Bowdish filed an ethics complaint about Vekos in April, the prosecutor told her office not to communicate with Bowdish, according to an annual report from Bowdish’s investigations unit describing the fallout. 
Bowdish declined to comment on her ethics complaint. 
Vekos restricted Bowdish’s badge access and removed her from a state’s attorney software platform, preventing Bowdish from getting updates on cases, the annual report said.
Instead, Vekos was sending information on cases to other staff in Bowdish’s office, according to the report. That information was “often late and inaccurate,” the report said. 
“Bottom line victims are suffering,” the report said. 
At least five victims in cases investigated by Bowdish’s office retained their own attorneys due to lack of support from Vekos, according to the report. “This is something that has never happened before,” the document said. 
Vekos, in responding to questions via email, said the decision to cut off contact with Bowdish was based on advice from her attorney. Vekos said she took Bowdish off the court’s software systems back in 2023 because Bowdish, as a member of the public, shouldn’t have access to the platform. 
When asked to respond to Santa Maria’s claim, Vekos said, “There has never been any sort of retaliation against advocates in the community.” Santa Maria declined to comment. 
While conflicts between Vekos and the two community partners stewed, the only advocate directly employed by Vekos’ office, Katie Dutton, resigned in April. Dutton declined to comment. 
After Dutton left Vekos’ office, the position sat vacant for about three months. “When the office is understaffed, the whole team pitches in to make sure the job gets done,” Vekos wrote in a July email in response to a request for an interview.
During those months, Vekos’ strained relationships with Bowdish and Santa Maria bubbled to the surface. During that time period, emails sent from Bowdish describe instances in which Vekos declined to meet with victims if Bowdish was present. Those emails were obtained by VTDigger through a public records request. 
Maggie Zraly, who was hired as the victim advocate in Vekos’ office this past summer, declined a request for an interview but said her office has been a “supportive environment” where she can serve victims. 
Bowdish’s ethics complaint is still pending.
‘She doesn’t care about me or community safety’ 
Three crime victims, in addition to the business owner, told VTDigger that Vekos mistreated them. They said Vekos was disrespectful and did not take their input into their cases seriously. 
A 45-year-old Starksboro woman is the mother of one of those victims. The Starksboro woman said she has advocated for her daughter since she was sexually assaulted at age 15. 
Police affidavits describe how a 24-year-old man groomed the woman’s daughter and started picking her up late at night while her parents slept. The Starksboro woman contacted police when she looked at her daughter’s phone and found pictures of the man sexually assaulting her. 
The man was charged with four felony sexual assault counts, each of which could could carry up to 20 years in prison, along with other charges. 
The Starksboro woman and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office said the assigned advocate, Bowdish, would email Vekos multiple times asking for updates about the case days before a hearing and oftentimes Vekos wouldn’t respond until minutes before court. 
The mother and her daughter told Bowdish they opposed a plea deal, and Bowdish shared their opposition with Vekos, the Starksboro woman said. 
“Even though Eva heard the things we were saying, she still went ahead with her plea deals as she made them,” the Starksboro woman said. 
In September, Vekos scaled back the charges against her daughter’s assailant to just one misdemeanor, court records show. He pled guilty and was sentenced to five years of probation, court documents show. 
For the man’s sentencing in court, the Starksboro woman’s daughter wrote a statement to the judge, saying she did not agree with the outcome and that Vekos had never consulted her. It was the third time Vekos made a plea agreement without consulting her or her mother, the daughter said. 
“This man destroyed my life. There are videos of me out there — god knows where. Do you know how terrifying that is? Do you care? It’s very clear Ms. Vekos doesn’t,” the daughter wrote.
“She doesn’t care about me or community safety. Ms. Vekos cares more about giving him the best deal than actually upholding the law,” she wrote.
Another case handled by Vekos played out similarly. 
In May 2022, a young woman who grew up in Vermont and goes to college in Virginia sought help from police after she was sexually assaulted at age 18, she said in an interview. The man she reported was originally facing a felony charge that could carry up to five years in prison, court records show. 
In December 2024, Vekos reduced the charge to a misdemeanor that only carried up to a year in prison, according to court documents. That was despite the college student’s vocal opposition, she said. 
“Everything just went smaller and smaller and smaller,” the college student said. 
The man agreed to plead no contest and, in exchange for a recommendation that he not serve any time, agreed to follow several probation conditions. None of those conditions agreed to by Vekos were geared toward preventing sex crimes, such as not working somewhere that regularly serves minors, court documents show. 
The college student and a person who works closely with cases in Vekos’ office said she found out that Vekos had agreed to the probation conditions only seven minutes before the man’s sentencing in court — meaning she did not have time to give meaningful input to Vekos or argue against his punishment.  
“Then I can’t change anything because the attorneys already made the agreement. They’ve already given it to the judge, and if they don’t inform us, it’s kind of like a ‘screw you’ situation,” the college student said. 
Like the Bristol business owner, the college student said when she complained that Vekos was discussing deals with the defense that she opposed, Vekos dismissed her concerns. Instead, Vekos complained about how much work it would create for her to push for the outcome the college student wanted, she said.
Asked about the college student’s complaints against her, Vekos said via email that she could not discuss that case and others because she’s constrained by privacy laws. 
“Also, there are several other additional sex assaults with child victims that I have prosecuted, including one involving a serial offender whose trial I personally conducted, leading to a guilty verdict and a sentence of 20 years to life,” Vekos wrote in an email. When asked what cases she was referring to in a follow-up email, the prosecutor did not specify in her reply. 
Beyond Vekos’ prosecution of sex offenses, other victims take issue with Vekos’ emotional insensitivity in their cases.

Tina Galante-Cram, a nurse who lives in Bristol, said Vekos was insensitive in her daughter’s case. 
Galante-Cram’s daughter, Jaida Cram, died after being injured in a car crash in April. Police affidavits say that Cram’s boyfriend was driving under the influence of marijuana with a suspended license.
It’s been hard to know how to live without her daughter.
“I’m not supposed to outlive my daughter,” Galate-Cram said in an interview in downtown Bristol, wearing a pink shirt printed with a picture of her daughter’s face.
Galate-Cram was 14 years old when she gave birth to her daughter and she put everything she had into raising her, she said. She wears her daughter’s ashes in a pendant around her neck. 
After her death, Cram’s boyfriend was charged with three felony crimes related to the crash, including manslaughter, court documents show. The case has since been moved to juvenile court. 
Without first consulting the mother, Galante-Cram said Vekos surprised her by proposing in court to amend the boyfriend’s probation conditions to allow him to attend Cram’s memorial. 
Galante-Cram said she was shocked. Vekos should not have ever proposed such an idea to the court, especially without consulting her first, she said. 
“I don’t want the killer mourning my child,” Galante-Cram said.
“She’s just looking at it like it’s another case,” she said of Vekos. “She doesn’t care.”

Before the U.S. Supreme Court recognized the right to an abortion in Roe v. Wade, a lot of women and girls died trying to end their pregnancies themselves. How many is impossible to know.
Since our current court overturned Roe, women are once again dying, as ProPublica has reported. But not in numbers anywhere near those of pre-Roe deaths from self-administered abortion. Then, as one doctor explained, “‘wire coat hangers, knitting needles, and slippery tree branches’ were the most common approaches.”
The vastly lower mortality post-Roe is the result of a number of factors, including there still being states where abortion is legal to travel to, along with abortion funds and internet forums helping people get there. 
But the biggest reason we aren’t seeing more deaths from self-managed abortion is modern medicine. Specifically, mifepristone. 
Mifepristone has been used for medication abortion in the U.S. for the past quarter century. The FDA’s 2000 approval of mifepristone meant women could have abortions earlier in pregnancy, rather than having to stay pregnant for weeks to have more invasive, procedural abortions. 
Patients report that a very early medication abortion can be no worse than a menstrual period. 
Today two thirds of abortions in the U.S. are medication abortions. Mifepristone is also used to treat miscarriages, which one in 10 women with known pregnancies will experience. And it is used to treat a slew of other conditions.
Opponents of legal abortion hate medication abortion. It makes it technically possible to have an abortion as soon as you suspect you are pregnant, and abortion opponents want to keep the focus on the women that they can vilify for needing later abortions. The early miscarriage induced by a medication abortion takes place in the privacy of one’s own home, depriving anti-abortion “sidewalk counselors” of the opportunity to intimidate women as they enter clinics. 
Basically, the advent of mifepristone made ending a pregnancy less painful and abortion opponents want it to be more painful.
Newly appointed Missouri Attorney General Catharine Hanaway has now joined the crusade to block access to mifepristone with a new filing in what remains of a sprawling and ridiculous lawsuit initiated in Texas that the U.S. Supreme Court mostly tossed. 
The remnants have landed in Missouri.
Anti-abortion doctors sued to have mifepristone taken off the market. The ultra-conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that claim was time-barred (again, it was approved 25 years ago). The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that, thanks to federal conscience protections entitling the doctors to deny treatment, their fear of having to provide emergency care to someone who had taken mifepristone wasn’t an injury giving them standing to sue. 
But the case lives on.
Missouri, Idaho and Kansas had intervened as fellow plaintiffs. Those states can’t sue in Texas, so the Texas district court transferred the case to Missouri, where our federal courts are newly stacked with extremely anti-abortion Trump appointees, many of whom worked on this and other anti-abortion legal efforts as attorneys. 
While the attempt to get mifepristone off the market completely is dead, plaintiffs are seeking to make it inaccessible by forcing the FDA to reinstate unnecessary restrictions. For example, requirements for multiple appointments and that the pill be taken in the presence of a physician rather than obtained at a pharmacy like most medicines. 
I had hoped Hanaway might see her job as being a good lawyer working in the interests of all Missourians, rather than a culture warring partisan like her recent predecessors. It was not to be.
The filing is another piece of work indicative of how unseriously Hanaway takes her ethical obligations as the state’s top lawyer. It is filled with distortions about the law and women’s health care. In it, she and her counterparts claim to be seeking to protect women’s safety. In reality, all the evidence shows and all the nation’s major medical groups agree that her desired outcome would put us in danger. 
It’s impossible to believe this accomplished lawyer doesn’t understand that — she just doesn’t care. 
The filing adds an additional claim against the FDA for approving a second generic version of mifepristone in September. Hanaway acknowledges that the generic is chemically identical to the branded mifepristone, but argues it shouldn’t have been approved because the brand-name drug is unsafe.
That isn’t true. As the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Medical Association and nine other medical associations explained in an amicus brief, mifepristone is among the most studied drugs in the world. And those studies show it is safe.
The claim that making mifepristone harder to get will make abortion safer is audaciously disingenuous. Plaintiffs purport to lament the end of the in-person prescribing requirement because it severs the relationship between patient and doctor. These are the same people working to keep it illegal to have a medication abortion under the supervision of a local doctor. 
They are also fighting to keep mifepristone from women who are miscarrying. Even under the somewhat loosened regulations, mifepristone is largely unavailable in Missouri for miscarriage treatment because the process to become an approved prescriber remains arduous.
Mifepristone is currently completely unavailable for abortion care despite the passage of the Reproductive Freedom Initiative due to state restrictions currently being challenged in court.
Plaintiffs want mifepristone harder to access outside of Missouri. That means patients will have to have later abortions waiting for appointments and travel multiple times or spend days in hotel rooms for unnecessary additional visits. That will be too much for some people to manage or afford, causing more to order mifepristone online to self-manage — which is a massive improvement over slippery tree branches, but shouldn’t be one’s only option. 
Hanaway’s filing specifically laments that the generic’s approval could make mifepristone less expensive. Plaintiffs want to punish women for ending pregnancies by making the process as expensive, stressful, late, and medically invasive as possible.
This duplicity is not new, but it stings more coming from Missouri’s first female attorney general.",https://missouriindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/54921771475_e3916f919a_c.jpg,,,2025-12-08 06:57:23.952322

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


	A proposed budget from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that cuts funds which have meant the difference between shelter and homelessness for about 170,000 people nationwide has left communities scrambling. In Wisconsin, the cuts are projected to cause the loss of permanent housing for 2,379 people according to a report by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The loss of funds would hit early in the new year, leaving local governments to absorb the fallout in the middle of winter. 
Korey Lundin, senior staff attorney at the National Housing Law Project and former staff attorney with Legal Action of Wisconsin, told the Wisconsin Examiner that the grants that HUD cut —  known as Continuum of Care (CoC) funds — “help thousands of people. That includes folks who have been recently unhoused.” In Wisconsin, 52% of permanent housing funding is covered by the CoC program. 
The people the CoC program serves, Ludin said, include “families, children, seniors, veterans, those who are survivors of domestic violence,” and others who are “not just the stereotypical image that people get when they think of a homeless person.”
In Milwaukee County, over $12 million in CoC funds covers direct rent payments to help provide housing for vulnerable county residents. The investments help support thousands of people across more than 20 housing programs. 
CoC funding in Milwaukee County supports housing for:

over 770 children;
154 young adults between 18 and 24 years old, 
560 working-age residents from 25 to 44 years old, 
590 people between the ages of 45 to 64,
826 people with no income at all, 
347 who earn only $500-$1000 a month,
1,049 people diagnosed with mental health disorders,
321 people with physical disabilities,
123 with co-occurring substance use disorders,
549 people who’ve remained in housing for over five years,
and 610 people who’ve maintained housing for 1 to 2 years. 

HUD has also proposed capping permanent housing support at 30%. In Milwaukee County 89% of CoC funds are dedicated to permanent housing beds. The picture isn’t much different for Dane County (where 78% of CoC funding goes to permanent beds), or Racine County (where 80% of CoC funding supports permanent beds). 
HUD announced the cuts saying they will help fulfill President Donald Trump’s “Ending Crime and Disorder on America’s Streets” executive order. HUD claimed that cutting support for permanent housing beds across the country will restore “accountability to homelessness programs” while promoting “self-sufficiency among vulnerable Americans.” 
The Trump administration has been criticized for policies that essentially criminalize homelessness, jailing and displacing unhoused people in an effort to beautify cities. Lundin sees the HUD cuts as part of that effort. He told the Wisconsin Examiner, “They want to round up and warehouse the unhoused. They want to incarcerate the unhoused. The solutions they’re talking about are solutions that exacerbate homelessness.”
HUD Secretary Scott Turner has said that restricting and cutting permanent bed funding is “ending the status quo that perpetuated homelessness through a self-sustaining slush fund.” In a press release announcing the cuts, HUD criticized “the failed ‘Housing First’ ideology, which encourages dependence on endless government handouts while neglecting to address the root causes of homelessness, including illicit drugs and mental illnesses.”
Housing First is an approach to addressing homelessness that prioritizes placing individuals in permanent and stable housing. One 2022 study — which noted that chronic homelessness in the U.S. costs up to $3.4 billion — found that the economic benefits of implementing Housing First programs outweigh the costs of the programs. In 2023, the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs published a research brief highlighting that “strong evidence exists that the Housing First model leads to quicker exits from homelessness and greater housing stability over time compared with treatment as usual.” It also stated that studies on the Housing First Model — four of which were reviewed to compile the research brief — show that the model “results in greater improvements in housing outcomes for homeless adult populations in North America.” 
Milwaukee County Executive David Crowley, who credits the county’s Housing First approach for a sharp reduction in homelessness, told the Examiner, “I am deeply concerned about the Trump administration’s move to slash permanent housing funding. This decision will destabilize housing for people across the country and it threatens the real progress we have made in Milwaukee County through our Housing First program.” Crowley noted that Milwaukee County has been recognized for having the lowest number of unsheltered homeless residents count per capita in the country, “and we are looked at as a national leader in this space. As someone who knows what housing insecurity feels like, I will pull every lever I can to protect working families and expand access to permanent housing so we can keep our state moving forward.” 
Especially in the winter, the HUD cuts could have troubling consequences. “We don’t have any state protection that prohibits people from being evicted in winter,” said Lundin, who lives in Wisconsin. “If this goes through it would be happening in the worst time here in Wisconsin in the middle of the winter.” 
Lawsuits are already being filed by cities, states and nonprofits. Lundin also said that Congress could intervene by appropriating funding for the HUD programs the administration plans to cut in 2026. In a statement to the Examiner, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Milwaukee) called CoC funding and homeless programs “vital to many organizations in Wisconsin and in Milwaukee who help the unhoused and keep people housed.” 
Moore said in the statement, “as per usual with this administration, it is the most vulnerable, like domestic violence survivors and LGBTQ youth, who would be hit the hardest. The Trump Administration’s proposal disregards Congress’s intent and would be catastrophic, putting 170,000 Americans at risk of homelessness. I am pleased to have joined my colleagues on several letters opposing these changes. House and Senate Members on both sides of the aisle have also pushed back because they recognize what it would do: Move us backward in the fight to end homelessness.”
Advocates are urging members of Congress to support a final HUD spending bill that increases funding for housing vouchers and protects CoC funds for permanent housing. The House and Senate version of a bill to fund HUD’s affordable housing, community development, and homelessness services programs differ by billions of dollars as the two chambers work to hammer out a year-end spending deal.

COVERT TWP. — The Palisades Nuclear Plant, a facility shut down just two years ago, is poised to become the first U.S. commercial nuclear power reactor ever to be restarted, a result of a $400 million investment announced Dec. 2 by the U.S. Department of Energy and Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
Proponents hail the federal funding as a validation of Michigan’s role as a clean energy leader; opponents have filed a lawsuit against it, claiming the plant’s owner inappropriately took billions in public funds.
The new investment will finance the historic recommissioning of the original reactor and the deployment of two advanced small modular reactors at the Lake Michigan site.
The combined effort is projected to nearly double the site’s capacity, supplying enough carbon-free electricity to power approximately 1.4 million Michigan households and businesses, according to the governor’s office.
The $400 million is the latest addition to a vast federal commitment to Holtec International, the plant’s owner, which includes a $1.52 billion Department of Energy loan guarantee and over $1.3 billion from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, aimed at lowering energy costs for rural electric cooperatives like Wolverine Power.
“This historic investment will double Palisades’ capacity, provide more clean energy for Michigan homes and businesses, and protect 900 good-paying Michigan jobs,” Whitmer said in a statement. “(It) will lower energy costs, reaffirm Michigan’s clean energy leadership, and show the world that we are the best place to do business.”
 A dual-technology energy hub

The facility, located in Van Buren County’s Covert Township, will combine established and advanced nuclear technology for a total baseload power capacity of 1,400 megawatts:

Original reactor restart: The 800-MW pressurized water reactor that ceased operation in May 2022 is being prepared for recommissioning, an unprecedented feat in U.S. nuclear history.
Next-generation SMRs: Holtec plans to deploy two of its advanced SMR-300 reactors, each capable of generating 300 MW.

Holtec purchased the facility in June 2022 with the initial intent to decommission it, but reversed course amid political and environmental pressure to retain the major source of carbon-free power.
The $1.9 billion in combined direct federal and state funding is the financial backbone of this resurrection, which aims to extend the plant’s operational life to at least 2051.
 Legal, technical opposition mounts

While some are celebrating the announcement, several environmental groups have filed a federal lawsuit to block the restart, accusing Holtec of a “bait-and-switch” for seeking billions in subsidies after initially planning to dismantle the facility.
The complaint was filed in Grand Rapids federal court by organizations including Beyond Nuclear, Don’t Waste Michigan and Michigan Safe Energy Future.
“In our view, Holtec lacks both the operational experience and demonstrated accountability required to merit public trust. If Holtec wishes to pursue these ventures, it should do so using private capital — not public funds,” Michigan Safe Energy Future said on its website.
In stark contrast to the governor’s statement, Kevin Kamp, a radioactive waste specialist for Beyond Nuclear, said Holtec’s “unprecedented zombie restart” would jumpstart a reactor that was designed in the 1960s, which could bring unknown risks.
Kamp pointed to infamous nuclear disasters throughout history, including a partial core meltdown at Fermi Unit 1 in Monroe County in 1966 and the Three Mile Island Unit 2 meltdown in 1979 in Pennsylvania.
“Just imagine what havoc could be wreaked by two 300 MW-e reactors — each 4.5 times larger — at Palisades going forward,” Kamp said.
The planned restart is rooted in a history marked by operational challenges and a premature shutdown that shocked many in Michigan. The plant first connected to the grid in 1971.
From its initial commercial operation, the facility was plagued by persistent issues: within 13 months of opening, it suffered a radioactive leak in its steam generators, leading to a year-long shutdown, previous media reports indicated.
Despite having a license valid through 2031, its previous owner, Entergy, closed it in May 2022, citing financial pressures from inexpensive natural gas and the dynamics of the deregulated electricity market. The current federal and state effort aims to resurrect the facility and safeguard regional economic stability.
Kamp noted a lengthy documented history of multiple radioactive leaks and exposures that occurred at Palisades over the decade leading up to the plant’s decommissioning, including a radiation incident involving workers in 2014, leading to the NRC downgrading the plant from a top-tier reactor.
“Palisades has a long list of breakdown phase risks,” Kamp said. “The Palisades zombie reactor has multiple pathways to reactor core meltdown, which would unleash catastrophic amounts of hazardous ionizing radioactivity into the environment, on the beach of Lake Michigan, drinking water supply for 16 million people along its shores, and more than 40 million people downstream and downwind, up the food chain, and down the generations throughout the Great Lakes region.”
If the Palisades were to melt down, thousands would be at risk of radiation poisoning and billions in property damage.
Parts of Allegan County in Casco Township are within a 10-mile radiusEmergency Planning Zone — the prime area where people could be affected by a radiation leak from the plant, and evacuations would be most likely in an emergency.
The rest of the county, as well as Holland and Ottawa County, are in a 50-mile secondary emergency zone, where people could receive indirect exposure to radiation through contaminated food and water if there were a radiation leak.
Kamp said a 1982 report said a Palisades meltdown would cause a thousand acute radiation poisoning deaths, 7,000 radiation injuries, 10,000 latent cancer fatalities, and $52 billion in property damage — and that would be much more now.
“Adjusting for inflation alone, property damage would now exceed $168 billion,” he said. “And since populations have increased around Palisades in the past 43 years, casualty figures would be significantly worse, as more people now live in harm’s way.”

(Photo courtesy the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service)The Indiana Department of Natural Resources has closed the bobcat trapping season after reaching the statewide quota of 250 bobcats in just four weeks.
The season was scheduled to run from Nov. 8 to Jan. 31, or until the quota of bobcats was reached.
A DNR news release said the framework of Indiana’s bobcat season was carefully designed with a total harvest limit based on population data collected throughout the state. Databases and reporting mechanisms were put into place to allow for close monitoring of the total season harvest.
“Licensed trappers had a successful first bobcat trapping season,” said Geriann Albers, DNR’s furbearer and gamebird program leader. “DNR will review what we’ve learned from this season as we move forward with regulated harvest and bobcat management.”
The bobcat season came after lawmakers passed legislation requiring the DNR to establish one. Before that, attempts to legalize killing bobcats had stalled in the DNR.
This bobcat trapping season was the first since 1969, when the species was nearly eliminated due to hunting, trapping and habitat loss. It was limited to 40 southern Indiana counties, including Brown, Monroe, Bartholomew, Clark and Dearborn.
Samantha Chapman, Indiana state director for Humane World for Animals, said “This bobcat trapping season was nothing short of a mass slaughter. Since November 8, recreational trappers have killed an average of about 9 bobcats every day, hitting the killing limit of 250 in just one month. That’s hundreds of bobcats who suffered in traps before being strangled, bludgeoned or shot to death.

The Oklahoma City business owner and her husband are evaluating their options as insurance premiums rise and subsidies are eliminated. (Photo courtesy of Kaylee Rains-Saucedo)OKLAHOMA CITY – Kaylee Rains-Saucedo relies on the federal insurance marketplace to insure her family.
Rains-Saucedo, who is wife and mother of two, is a small business owner. She has worked for three years to build her political consulting business. It’s something she doesn’t want to abandon for other employment because she believes in the American dream of owning her own business. Her husband stays at home to care for their children because child care costs are too high, she said.
Her family pays $750 a month for health insurance through the Affordable Care Act marketplace, she said. 
But Rains-Saucedo has found herself among thousands of Oklahomans facing sticker shock as they navigate the re-enrollment process. Most are facing soaring costs due to a combination of higher premiums and the end of some federal tax credits that have helped make their health insurance affordable.
The Oklahoma City resident said her monthly premium will rise to about $1,350 to $1,550. She gets a credit of about $400 a month to offset the premium cost.
“Right now, it means I am going to have to choose between having health insurance or being able to put food on the table,” she said.
The Rains-Saucedo said is trying to pick up more business, which will mean more time away from her family.
“It’s just a really big problem for us,” she said. “I honestly don’t know what we are going to do financially yet, until I can find more work.”
More than 300,000 Oklahomans rely on the Affordable Care Act marketplace for health insurance, said Insurance Commissioner Glen Mulready.
And of those, 97% are receiving some level of subsidy to offset their premiums, Mulready said.
Most consumers will see their average insurance premiums increase by 29%, he said. 
The loss of subsidies coupled with premium increases represent a “double whammy for the consumer,” Mulready said.
He said he fears the cost increases will deter young healthy people from enrolling. They’ll opt instead to go without health insurance, Mulready said.
“That is not a good situation,” Mulready said. “You need young, healthy people to participate.”
About 289,000 Oklahoman receive the enhanced tax credit of $559 a month, said Rich Rasmussen, president and CEO of the Oklahoma Hospital Association.
Oklahoma consumers receive about $1.9 billion in premium assistance, which is set to end Jan. 1, unless Congress acts, he said.
The U.S. Senate is set to vote on extending those enhanced tax credits Thursday, but the plan may not have the bipartisan support needed to advance.
Jennifer Eastwood, of Norman, buys her insurance through the federal insurance marketplace and receives a subsidy. She said she has several medical conditions, including Lupus, a chronic autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks healthy tissue.
“I am going to lose my insurance and go off all my treatments unless something changes at the last minute,” Eastwood said.
Broader implications
The increase in premiums and reduction in subsidies has broader implications for Oklahoma.
According to the Cicero Institute, Oklahoma ranks in the bottom for primary care and physician availability. 
The state ranks 48th nationally in physician supply, 46th in primary care doctors and 47th in general surgeons, according to the Cicero Institute, a nonpartisan policy organization.
Of the state’s 77 counties, 75 are health care professional shortage areas.
The problem is particularly acute in rural Oklahoma, where patients have longer waits and spend more time on the road to access care.
Oklahoma already has the second highest rate of uninsured in the country, said Zack Stoycoff, executive director of Healthy Minds, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank that tries to improve mental health outcomes in Oklahoma.
For the uninsured, the options are to seek health care through charities, whose services are often overwhelmed and underfunded, Stoycoff said.
The other option is to seek treatment that costs more, such as through a hospital emergency room, resulting in uncompensated care and more costs to the facility, he said.
“Hospitals are already strapped, especially rural hospitals,” he said.
Rasmussen said the changes will hit rural hospitals and providers hard and will impact the health care professional shortage.
The ability to have health care correlates to a person’s ability to be employed and contribute to society, Stoycoff said.
“We want people to be healthy and have insurance, because it is ultimately more cost effective,” he said.
Up at night
The rising premiums and reduction in subsidies has caused “intense anxiety” for Rains-Saucedo, the Oklahoma City mother and business owner. 
She worries about being hit with a large medical bill that will take years to pay off.
“It has just made me stay up at night,” she said.

Meanwhile, the state is staring down long-term economic decline. 
The post Wyoming lawmakers square off with business council over government’s role in economic development appeared first on WyoFile .","Competing visions for the state’s economic future clashed Thursday as the Wyoming Business Council presented its budget proposal to the Wyoming Legislature’s Joint Appropriations Committee in Cheyenne. 
While the council has functioned as Wyoming’s statewide economic development agency since its creation in 1998, some lawmakers argue that government shouldn’t be involved. Meanwhile, the business council is warning that stagnant job and wage growth, as well as low workforce availability, are fueling long-term economic decline in Wyoming. 
“The markers of GDP, the markers of wages, the markers of [the] number of job opportunities, the outmigration of our youth and the widening gap between our population and our workforce all spell that our economy is not where we want it to be,” Business Council CEO Josh Dorrell told lawmakers Thursday. 
The Appropriations Committee met in Cheyenne last week for the first round of budget hearings ahead of the 2026 legislative session. After one lawmaker expressed interest in eliminating the business council, Thursday’s hearing put the agency squarely in the hot seat.  
“The business council today is a place where we understand the problem that we have better than ever,” Dorrell told lawmakers. “We understand the resources that we have or don’t have better than ever. And we understand that we’ve built a foundation that can be utilized as a way to change the economy.”

Josh Dorrell, CEO of the Wyoming Business Council (Wyoming Business Council)

Part of advancing Wyoming’s economy, Dorrell said, will require policy changes, including reforming the agency’s Business Ready Community grant and loan program. It’s also going to require more funding, he said. 
The council is asking lawmakers for about $112 million, while Gov. Mark Gordon’s recommendation for the agency is about half of that amount at nearly $55 million. However, Dorrell said, both of those figures would ultimately come up short, particularly when it comes to helping communities meet infrastructure needs, like extending water and sewer to business parks. 
“I thank you for giving us the courtesy of truth,” Senate Appropriations Chairman Tim Salazar, R-Riverton, said. “For you to be successful, you believe your budget should be somewhere over a billion, correct?”
“Mr. Chairman, yes,” Dorrell said. 
Gordon’s recommendation
House Appropriations Committee Chairman John Bear, R-Gillette, asked Dorrell about the discrepancy between the agency’s request and the governor’s recommendation. 
“I don’t see any other agencies where he’s denying half of the requests,” Bear said. “So that’s a pretty significant difference from your view and his.”
Dorrell confirmed that he told the governor neither budget was sufficient, but he also told Bear that Gordon has an entire state budget to consider and balance in his recommendations.
Lawmakers did not ask Gordon last Monday when he testified about the discrepancy, but in a Friday press release, the governor’s office reiterated that his budget recommendations are just that, because lawmakers are statutorily the state’s appropriators. 
“The Joint Appropriations Committee and the Legislature have often restored cuts to agency requests when they felt the increases were needed,” the press release said. “Governor Gordon’s budget has close to half a billion dollars on the table for the Legislature to make such decisions, including putting more into savings to benefit future generations.”

Gordon also pointed to his budget message, where he called for “maintaining low tax burdens and pursuing legal frameworks that attract new investment to broaden Wyoming’s economic base.” 
Council’s request
Ahead of last week’s hearings, the Wyoming Freedom Caucus — a group of Republicans who control the House — pledged to cut the budget, citing “pre-pandemic spending levels” as a general target. 
Dorrell told the committee Thursday that his agency’s budget request of almost $112 million “is actually less than the one that was submitted in 2019.”
Even so, several members of the committee expressed skepticism about funding the agency at all. Bear, for example, said he sees numerous issues with governments like Wyoming intervening to compete with other states in attracting private businesses.
“I understand that’s your responsibility … to try to compete with other states, make us competitive in that arena. But prior to that, you know, we’re 250 years old this next year. And prior to that, we went 150 years without government intervening in private sector business,” Bear said. 
“Don’t you agree that we have a great history in this country of private sector production?” Bear asked Dorrell. 
“Of course, I would agree with that,” Dorrell said. “And I might add that, you know, one of the things that we’re working to do is solve the problem that we have in front of us.” 
“I don’t get to go back 100 years to when states didn’t compete,” Dorrell said. “I get to solve the problem I have today. And the problem that we have today is that our outmigration of our youth and people who are born in this state is greater than any other state in the nation.”
Between 60% to 70% of Wyoming-born residents permanently leave the state by the time they are 30, according to a 2024 analysis prepared for the business council by Harvard Kennedy School researchers.

Rep. Ken Pendergraft, R-Sheridan, however, said he did “some research” and “found a couple of sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau that dispute” the outmigration findings that he hears from the business council “and others.”
“I just say that because I’m really interested in the truth,” Pendergraft said. 
Dorrell said while he hoped to be wrong about Wyoming’s outmigration, “our population and the demographics of our population would say that we’re probably right on.” 
Philosophical differences 
Pendergraft also said one of the criticisms he hears of the business council is “picking winners and losers,” and pointed to a metal fabricator in Sheridan County that was awarded a grant by the council, while there are other entities in the community that do the same work. 
The council only considers awarding grants to those who apply, Dorrell said, asking that Pendergraft provide him with “the names of those organizations that might be interested in this.”
Pendergraft also said he disputed the results of a statewide poll the business council completed earlier this year.
In September, the Tarrance Group, a Virginia-based Republican strategic research and polling firm, surveyed 514 registered voters in Wyoming about economic conditions, development priorities and community growth. 
“The results reveal a strong mandate for proactive, community-led growth and a clear consensus on the urgent need to retain our young people to build resilient communities,” according to an October press release from the council.
“I reject those results personally,” Pendergraft said, adding that “there were problems with how it was phrased.” 
Pendergraft also pushed back on the need for a business council at all. “How do you answer those that say it is not the role of government to build infrastructure?” he asked. “Leave that to the free market. Leave that to the businesses to develop that. Leave that to the consumers that want those things. How do you respond?”
It goes back to the problem of economic decline, Dorrell said, and there are plenty of examples across the state that indicate that the state’s minimal “investment in infrastructure” is working against Wyoming. 
“The idea that the state or that the community shouldn’t pay for infrastructure, that experiment is sort of running right now, and what it’s saying is that people are leaving and what it’s saying is our economy is in decline,” Dorrell said. 
Budget hearings will continue through this week before resuming Jan. 5. The committee is not expected to take any formal action on the budget bill until the week of Jan. 12.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)Oklahoma’s State Chamber needs to step aside and stop meddling in something they clearly know nothing about: education.
It’s clear from both public and media appearances that this influential business advocacy body is completely out of its depth in solving the education crisis which has long plagued Oklahoma.
Case in point: leaders of the group act like they’ve suddenly discovered that we rank at bottom in childhood literacy and that wealthy, established businesses don’t want to come here in large part because of that.
In a recent interview with Oklahoma City television station Fox 25, Chad Warmington, the group’s CEO, said it is “kind of fun to give the speech” to community groups that we rank at the bottom in reading. He said that he saw “surprise” and “shock” on people’s faces as he broke the news about our low rankings, including 49th in third grade literacy.
Tone deaf much? First off, nobody should be taking pleasure in discussing our students’ struggles. And secondly, I’d like to know who exactly in Oklahoma doesn’t know we’re cellardwellers in education outcomes. That news is not exactly a mic drop moment.
And in a further sign that business leaders in this group haven’t left their cushy corner offices and deigned to interact with us mere mortals, Warmington added during the interview that “a lot of political leaders” are talking about literacy that haven’t talked about it before.
I don’t know a single politician who hasn’t been talking about our lagging education outcomes and our low literacy rates. In fact, everybody has been talking about this for years now — both inside and outside the Capitol and trying to figure out how to fix it. 
But if all this wasn’t enough, the group is enthusiastically — and offensively — likening our children’s inability to read to the University of Oklahoma having a bad football season in the SEC and Oklahoma State University tanking in the Big 12. “Outrage would be deafening” if our reading scores were college football rankings, Warmington wrote in an editorial for The Oklahoman. 
“Coaches would be fired, strategies overhauled, and fans would never settle for it.”
To be clear, Oklahomans have not settled for this. Outrage already is deafening about education, and if the business community doesn’t know that then they’re completely out of touch with reality. Discussions about schools already dominate the 2026 gubernatorial race and conversations in the halls of our state Capitol.
To make better use of sports analogies, we cannot fire children’s parents, who are the equivalent of their head coaches, or the teachers we rely on to educate them. We already don’t have enough qualified people at the helm of our classrooms.
And, this is not the equivalent of a bad football season. This is more akin to the Chicago Cub’s 108-year World Series drought. The inability to read ripples across multiple generations.
And that’s why it’s so troubling that this advocacy group, which until recently has largely ignored this situation, has parachuted in during our crisis, claiming they have the golden bullet to solve our horrendous education outcomes — what many in education circles call the “Mississippi Miracle.”
Both Oklahoma and Mississippi passed laws in 2013 aimed at increasing literacy before fourth grade. The National Assessment of Education Progress test results showed Mississippi rose from last nationally to 21st. The state ranks second nationally in reading for children in poverty. Oklahoma, which later changed its law, has not seen similar progress.
The progress in Mississippi is attributed largely to the $100 million investment Jim and Sally Barksdale gave to develop a program to increase public school literacy rates. The money was overseen by an independent entity, not that state’s Department of Education. And the Barksdales demanded quantifiable results.
Warmington said Mississippi aligned the curriculum its higher education institutions are teaching teachers. They made sure that every school system is using the “same science of reading.” They brought in literacy coaches. And they held children back who weren’t reading at grade level.
That’s  great for Mississippi, but as I noted earlier we can’t get even qualified people to teach in Oklahoma. We’re so desperate for teachers, we’re allowing people with no education degree to lead our classrooms, so teaching the same curriculum in college really doesn’t matter in our case. 
Literacy coaches are going to cost money and require a financial investment from our Legislature, at a time when they’re obsessed with cutting taxes and giving big businesses tax breaks. 
During the 2023-24 school year, Oklahoma ranked 49th worst in what it spent per pupil at $11,311. Mississippi, meanwhile, spent $12,490 per student, according to an apples-to-apples comparison compiled by the National Education Association.
In the 2024-25 school year, Oklahoma was estimated to have spent $11,894 per student while Mississippi further widened the gap, spending $13,125. 
Both numbers represented about a 5% increase in spending.
Our class sizes are bigger in Oklahoma, too, probably because we don’t invest more in education. Mississippi had 13.6 students enrolled per teacher. Oklahoma had 16.3 students, according to the NEA analysis.
It’s easier to learn with smaller class sizes.
If we want to be Mississippi, we’re going to have to make a financial investment in schools.
To oversimplify our literacy crisis and say it can be solved by implementing the “Mississippi Miracle” is a mistake. Mississippi Today also reported that “reading miracle” has remained out of reach for some schools due to resource shortages and teacher turnover. 
Education systems are complex. No two children are completely alike or learn the same.
Solving this is going to take a multi-level approach, and require involving people who actually understand what is going on. 
That’s not the business community. We need to consult the people who are on the front lines, including those who work in low-performing and high poverty schools, who haven’t had the privilege of turning a blind eye to the problem and who, for years, haven’t been allowed to be complacent about it.
Warmington has said he wants to involve teachers in these discussions, but oddly enough, when the state Chamber held its business luncheon last month to unveil its vision for our schools, there wasn’t a single teacher highlighted. Only business leaders and Oklahoma lawmakers – none of whom had teaching experience – were the ones celebrating the state Chamber’s plan, which they dubbed Oklahoma Competes. 
Even more damning, state superintendent Lindel Fields said he didn’t attend.
Educators don’t tell CEOs how to run their businesses. So why should we trust people who don’t seem to ever set foot in schools to set this agenda for us?

(Photo by Kypros/Getty Images)New Jersey’s homeless population has crept up in recent years, and housing advocates say it is poised to skyrocket because President Donald Trump’s administration is changing how it funds permanent housing for people most at risk of homelessness.
The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development adopted new grant policies last month that critics warn would cancel already appropriated funds and force as many as 170,000 people — including more than 2,000 people in New Jersey — into homelessness.
“At a time when homelessness in New Jersey has been increasing, we have federal action that will definitely further increase homelessness,” said Arnold Cohen, senior policy coordinator at the Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey.
Young homebuyers lose more ground in housing market

New Jersey got about $66 million last year in federal funding to cover rent and supportive services for people most at risk of homelessness, said Taiisa Kelly, CEO of Monarch Housing Associates.
The state is expected to lose more than half of that, with cuts starting on Jan. 1, if HUD proceeds with its policy changes, Kelly said. Twenty states, including New Jersey, have sued to block the changes.
“We’re really waiting to see what will happen from that lawsuit,” Kelly said. “We really need a reversal of course on this, because this is going to immediately cause folks to experience homelessness, and it’s going to fundamentally change the programs — and change them in a way that we know doesn’t work.”
New Jersey uses what’s called a housing-first approach to homelessness reduction, which gets people into stable housing without conditioning it on sobriety, income, or other things that have historically served as hurdles to housing security. Once a person is stably housed, providers work to get them supportive services to address their other needs.
Proponents of the strategy say it’s a key approach to making homelessness “rare, brief, and non-recurring,” said Richard Uniacke, president of Bridges Outreach, a nonprofit that does street outreach and provides housing services in Union, Essex, and Somerset counties.
HUD has encouraged housing-first policies for over a decade.
But Trump announced in a July executive order that his administration would take a different approach. He rejected housing-first policies, saying they “deprioritize accountability and fail to promote treatment, recovery, and self-sufficiency.” He ordered mandatory treatment for people whose mental illness or addiction contributed to their homelessness and directed law enforcement to crack down on homeless encampments, loitering, squatting, and open drug use.
HUD officials consequently announced last month a series of changes that would cut two-thirds of the $3.9 billion in federal funds it had allocated for permanent housing; shift funding to transitional housing with work and other requirements; reduce automatic renewals of housing vouchers; and withhold funds from applicants that follow housing-first policies.
The Trump administration pitched the changes as “monumental reforms,” saying housing-first policies encourage “dependence on endless government handouts” while not addressing the root causes of homelessness.
“Our philosophy for addressing the homelessness crisis will now define success not by dollars spent or housing units filled, but by how many people achieve long-term self-sufficiency and recovery,” said HUD chief Scott Turner. “These long-overdue reforms will promote independence and ensure we are supporting means-tested approaches to carry out the President’s mandate, connect Americans with the help they need, and make our cities and towns beautiful and safe.”
The agency also now forbids grant recipients from using funds in ways that violate the Trump administration’s immigration agenda or opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion and “gender ideology.” Critics say that threatens housing assistance and supportive services for certain marginalized groups, such as transgender youth, who experience homelessness at disproportionately high rates.
“They’re putting us in a position where we actually run the risk of breaking state laws in order to adapt to some of these requirements,” Uniacke said. “We have to provide services with no preconditions. We cannot be coercive of people who are experiencing homelessness in order to get them to treatment or get them connected to services.”
The National Alliance to End Homelessness estimates HUD’s changes could cost New Jersey $37.6 million in lost federal funding, leaving 2,439 people at risk of losing their housing. New Jersey had nearly 13,800 people living in shelters, hotels, or on the street as of last January, the most recent annual enumeration of the state’s homeless population. The alliance believes homelessness could climb in New Jersey by almost 18% next year.

Kelly warns that a jump in the state’s homeless population will have an impact that ripples far beyond those who lose their housing.
“We’re going to see agencies that have to close because they’re going to lose so much money from the program,” Kelly said. “It’s going to impact landlords who rely on this rental assistance payment to keep up their units. It’s just going to destabilize our communities across the board. So it’s really important that we collectively find an answer.”
Advocates say answers should include increased philanthropy, rent control, and the passage of legislation that would detail rights for New Jersey’s homeless population and allow municipalities to create homelessness trust funds, among other things.
Mostly, they agree, any effort to end homelessness cannot succeed without more money.
Kelly estimated $430 million would cover rental assistance for a year and supportive services for the 18,000 families who, according to a state database, accessed homelessness services in New Jersey last year.
Cohen agreed funding is the game-changer, pointing to a state effort, launched in 2024, to get more than 1,000 homeless veterans permanent housing.
“We have municipalities in New Jersey that have essentially ended homelessness for veterans because those resources have been there,” he said. “We have not put those resources into families.”

Property taxes are one of the only guardrails we have that discourage people from hoarding land and housing they do not use, writes Rep. Mike Yin.
The post Eliminating property taxes would sell out Wyoming forever appeared first on WyoFile .","Every Wyoming town with a good view, a nearby outdoor recreation area, a small airport or a good marketing campaign could become a target for out-of-state investors. The more real estate these investors buy, the tighter the housing market becomes for the people who actually live and work in those communities. With less inventory and more outside demand, prices go up, making housing unattainable for Wyoming families and future generations. 

Opinion

This is the future we are driven toward by one simple idea: no property taxes.
The Legislature’s Joint Revenue Committee has put forward a proposal to eliminate residential property taxes in Wyoming.
Every Wyomingite should take a step back and look hard at what this plan, which would also require voter approval, would really do. If this proposal passes, we will permanently turn our communities into a discount investment product for people who do not live here. The end result, transforming Wyoming into a full-blown tax shelter for out-of-state residents, will only make it even harder for young people and working families to afford a home. In short, by eliminating property taxes, we sell out our future. 
Property taxes are one of the only guardrails we have that discourage people from hoarding land and housing they do not use. If I am a wealthy out-of-state investor and I see land in a beautiful, low-population state with no property tax at all, I start running the numbers in my head. No ongoing expense. No annual tax bill. No cost to sit on a second, third or fourth house for years and wait for prices to rise. 
In that world, I would try to buy as much Wyoming land and housing as I could as fast as possible. And I would have no incentive to sell it again anytime soon, and certainly not for an affordable price. 
We already see this pressure in places where demand from wealthy out-of-state buyers is strong. When homes are treated first as an asset and only second as a place to live, prices rise faster than local wages. Teachers, nurses, sheriff’s deputies and service workers get pushed further and further away from the communities they serve. Property taxes create a carrying cost for holding multiple homes that sit empty most of the year, while paying for the critical services and infrastructure that make those homes livable in the first place. Eliminating property taxes would make speculative buying even more attractive. 
This is exactly the opposite of the Wyoming that we say we want for our kids and grandkids. We say we want young people to stay in Wyoming, start families and build careers here. We say we want them to be able to buy a home in the town where they grew up. A policy that invites unlimited outside demand for housing undercuts that goal. It tilts the playing field toward cash buyers who fly in a few weeks a year and away from the family trying to scrape together a down payment from a Wyoming paycheck.
There is another honest conversation we need to have. When politicians promise to get rid of property taxes, they almost always plan to make it up somewhere else, usually with a big increase to the statewide sales tax.
That might sound harmless until you think about who really pays.
The biggest landowners see their property tax bills disappear. That burden gets passed to the mom in Rock Springs buying clothes and notebooks for the first day of school.It gets passed to the dad in Casper paying for his kids’ hockey equipment and a pair of winter boots.It gets passed to the worker in Gillette trying to keep the truck running and pay the electricity bill that keeps going up. 
The owner of three houses in Jackson comes out ahead. The family trying to afford one modest home pays more every time they go through the checkout line.
That isn’t tax relief for the middle class. It is shifting the burden from the wealthiest landowners to the everyday Wyomingites who have to spend most of their paycheck just to get by.
Everything is getting more expensive, but the answer is not to blow up our entire tax system, which would make things worse. It’s to continue working on targeted relief that actually reaches the people who need help, and to build more housing for the middle class.
The Legislature has expanded the state property tax refund program so that more middle-class homeowners can qualify. It is not perfect and we should keep improving it, but it has already helped keep Wyomingites in their homes. 
And we can build on that work with real housing policy. That means working with local governments on land use to ensure that middle-class housing, rather than just high-end inventory, is possible to develop. It means making it easier to finance the infrastructure that new homes require.
There are solutions. But first, we have to answer a basic question: Who is Wyoming for?
Is it for the people who live here year round, who send their kids to our schools, who volunteer at the food bank, who plow the roads, who run the clinics and fix the power lines? Or is it for investors who want a safe place to park wealth in the form of land and houses they rarely use?
Eliminating property taxes would send a very clear signal about the Legislature’s answer to that question. I hope we choose differently.

To preserve public confidence in the judiciary, the commission ensures judges adhere to ethical standards, writes commission member Nicholas Bellack.
The post Safeguarding justice: The Wyoming Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics appeared first on WyoFile .","When most of us think about judges, we imagine solemn black robes, gavel strikes and the rule of law being carefully applied in our courtrooms. But what happens if a judge acts unethically, fails to follow the law or loses the public’s trust? In Wyoming, the answer lies with a little-known but essential body: the Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics.

Opinion

This constitutionally created, independent commission exists to ensure that Wyoming’s judges uphold the high standards the public expects. These ethical standards, which all judicial officers from municipal court judges to supreme court justices must adhere to, can be found in the Wyoming Code of Judicial Conduct. For nearly 50 years, the commission has been the guardian of accountability in our judicial system — preserving citizens’ confidence in the courts.
A history rooted in accountability
The commission traces its origins to 1970, when Wyoming voters approved a constitutional amendment creating the Judicial Supervisory Committee. At the time, this was a groundbreaking step acknowledging that even judges, who interpret the law, must themselves be held to standards of conduct.
In 1996, Wyoming voters updated the system, replacing the Supervisory Committee with today’s 12-member Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics. Its authority comes directly from Article 5, Section 6 of the Wyoming Constitution and its independence within the judicial branch is by design. The people of Wyoming insisted that accountability for judges should not be left to politics or personal influence, but entrusted to a balanced panel representing the judiciary, the legal profession and the public itself.
Who serves on the commission?
The commission consists of 12 volunteers and is deliberately diverse in its composition. This includes:

Three judges (two from the district court and one from the circuit court), chosen by their fellow judges.
Three attorneys, appointed by the Wyoming State Bar.
Six citizen members, known as “electors,” appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate.

This structure ensures that no single group dominates. Instead, legal professionals and everyday citizens share responsibility for reviewing judicial conduct complaints, providing an important safeguard for public trust.
How do complaints work?
The commission’s work begins when someone files a written, verified complaint against a judge. These complaints can allege judicial misconduct, criminal wrongdoing, civil misconduct or even disability that affects a judge’s ability to serve.
Interestingly, the commission also has the power to launch investigations on its own if credible concerns surface. This means that misconduct cannot simply be hidden if no one files paperwork.
Once a complaint is received, the process unfolds through a careful three-panel system:

The investigatory panel reviews the complaint, gathers records and may request a response from the judge. If necessary, it hires disciplinary counsel to dig deeper.
The adjudicatory panel holds hearings, applies the Wyoming Code of Judicial Conduct and determines whether the Code of Judicial Conduct was violated.
The disciplinary panel determines consequences that range from private discipline to public sanctions that the Wyoming Supreme Court must approve.

This step-by-step process ensures fairness for both the public and the judge involved.
Confidential, but not secret 
One of the commission’s most misunderstood features is confidentiality. By rule, all proceedings remain confidential unless and until a case results in a recommendation for public discipline. This protects judges from unfounded rumors and ensures that investigations are conducted fairly, rather than through the court of public opinion.
At the same time, the system is transparent where it matters most. If public discipline is warranted, the commission makes recommendations to the Wyoming Supreme Court, which has the final say. This balance helps protect judicial independence while still holding judges accountable to the people they serve.
What the numbers say
Between January 2024 and July 2025, the commission handled 79 cases:

57 complaints were dismissed quickly, often because they lacked evidence, did not fall under the commission’s jurisdiction or arose from problems that another agency could better address. For example, many were complaints about the outcome of a case more appropriately dealt with through appeal. In those instances, the commission refers members of the public to the more appropriate body.  
15 cases were dismissed after deeper review.
One judge received a letter of caution and another a letter of correction.
One private censure was issued, requiring monitoring of the judge’s conduct.
Four cases remain open.

These numbers show that while most complaints do not result in disciplinary action, the commission takes each one seriously. Even minor concerns can lead to corrective action designed to keep judges accountable.
Why the commission matters 
Most Wyomingites will never file a complaint with the commission or even hear its name in daily conversation. Yet its presence is critical. By diligently performing its work, the commission reassures the public that our judges are not beyond scrutiny.
In 1996, Wyoming voters understood a simple truth: Justice depends on trust. If citizens doubt the integrity of their judges, the entire system falters. The Commission on Judicial Conduct and Ethics exists to preserve public confidence in the judiciary, demonstrating that while judges interpret the law, they are also held accountable under rules of ethical standards.
For the average citizen, this means one thing: The next time you walk into a courtroom, you will know that while the judge has a good deal of authority, he or she also has accountability.

(Cindy Gonzalez/Nebraska Examiner)OMAHA — Better jobs, opportunities, recreation and desire for diversity and belonging. Those surfaced as top reasons an Omaha audience recently gave for why talented people they know fled for other states.

The group offered advice, including: Higher paying jobs with growth potential, affordable housing, better public transit and bike lanes, beautiful spaces, an inclusive community and political leadership that listens.
“We aren’t just an ag state,” one person responded in the interactive electronic survey taken at a public forum hosted by the City of Omaha Tuesday that featured a panel of speakers and drew an estimated 125 people. 
 Spotlight intensifies

About 70 attendees participated in the poll aimed at informing the city’s efforts to better attract and retain talent, particularly as it assembles a new “comprehensive plan” to guide growth and development over the next 20 years.
Given that more than half of Nebraska’s brain drain originates in the metro Omaha area, it is significant that city leaders are stepping up efforts to better understand and attack the problem, said Josie Schafer, a public policy and data researcher at the University of Nebraska at Omaha who spoke at the event and also advises the Nebraska Legislature on workforce trends.

Since 2019, about 17,000 people who have earned a bachelor’s degree or higher have left Nebraska and just over 10,000 moved from the Omaha area, said Schafer, who heads the UNO Center for Public Affairs Research.
“I’m really excited to see the city jumping in on this conversation and finding solutions that fit for us,” she said, noting that its urban economy and other circumstances differ from the many rural areas of the state.
Other local and state efforts and groups also are  converging to stem the exodus in what many see as an alarming wake-up moment for Nebraska as a whole, and particularly its two largest metros.
The Greater Omaha Chamber of Commerce, whose audience covers eight counties, is about to commission an in-depth brain drain-focused study, a spokesman said last week. Sparking that was the chamber’s latest “Barometer report,” which ranked the Omaha metro sixth lowest of 23 peer metros nationwide for jobs, talent and investment. 
A lead economist working on the report said the findings shined light on “uncomfortable truths” that must be confronted with “urgency.” The chamber’s young professionals group also had been gathering feedback.
Amplifying its alarm is the Aksarben Foundation, a more than century-old Nebraska business organization. Its research shows Nebraska’s two largest metros, Omaha and Lincoln, have lagged 68,000 jobs behind where both would have been had the markets kept pace the last five years with peers, including Des Moines, Sioux Falls, South Dakota and Fayetteville, Arkansas. 
Further probing by Aksarben’s research team has revealed widespread talent and wage loss in every region of the state, driven largely, it said, by scarcity of quality jobs and limited wage growth. Now the Aksarben leadership has formed a new nonprofit, “Strengthening Nebraska Families” to educate and stir action to elevate the state’s competitiveness. 
 ‘Without connection’ 

Aksarben’s Dana Bradford said discussion about brain drain — and the forces that for more than a decade have pushed more folks out of the state than in — have been going for some time, but “without connection.”

As the state’s budget woes become more pronounced and persistent — a $471 million shortfall is the latest projection — people and policymakers are starting to pay more attention, he said. 
“It’s pretty clear if Omaha and Lincoln were growing anywhere like they should have been we wouldn’t have the problem we have right now,” said Bradford, also a past chair of the Omaha chamber. “The reality is Omaha and Lincoln deliver 60% of tax revenues. If Omaha is struggling, everybody struggles.”
On Monday, the Aksarben Foundation is hosting a private meeting in the Ashland area, between Omaha and Lincoln, for select business, elected and other leaders intended to stimulate more discussion. 
Nebraska officials including Omaha Mayor John Ewing Jr. are to speak, as are experts expected to spotlight strategies in play or working elsewhere in the country to grow high-paying jobs and the talent pool.
Omaha still pushing for state incentive to help build sports facilities, despite Pillen headwinds

Ewing told the Nebraska Examiner he recognizes the urgency for quality job creation and wants to partner with state lawmakers and other elected officials on developing an economic incentive package that raises Omaha’s allure to new employers. 
“We also have companies I’ve talked to that would like to expand here, but the incentives are greater in other places,” he said, adding that he’s been told existing incentives are too laborious and should be easier to navigate.
The Democratic mayor, finishing his first year after ousting a 12-year Republican incumbent, said he and his administration are working to increase public and private support for business internships, public transportation options and affordable housing, which survey-takers underscored as pieces that could keep them from leaving Omaha. 
Public spaces are another focus to raise Omaha’s “fun” factor, Ewing said. He cited efforts to build a downtown soccer stadium and an expanded multi-purpose athletic complex in northwest Omaha that need a state tax incentive that Gov. Jim Pillen has for now put on ice, citing budget concerns.
Ewing is promoting new arrangements in which private foundations take on management and maintenance at certain city parks, saying that would allow city park staff to focus on fewer properties.

Creation of the new comprehensive 20-year growth and development plan also will help shape Omaha’s future infrastructure, amenities and talent-retention strategies. The city has been hosting meetings, including Tuesday’s brain drain-focused discussion, to inform the document. 
Land use updates, for example, could promote more “walkability” in districts. Other rules could encourage more communal areas and “belonging.” Those themes arose in survey recommendations. 
 Brain gain winners 

While social, civic and environmental factors play a role in brain drain, Schafer said that independent and Census-based research overwhelmingly point to jobs and career growth potential as top drivers of the out-migration trend.
A look at places outperforming Omaha in the brain gain contest, some without coastal sunshine and splash, underscore that Nebraska could compete with the right game plan, she said.
Denver and Stockton, California metros are in the pack where people recently moved to when leaving the Omaha area, census data shows. But Des Moines and Kansas City consistently rank in the top five, said Schafer. 
“These are places that have similar settings, environments, weather,” she said. “It’s not that they’re searching for something totally different from Omaha. The evidence really points to job opportunities as that leading factor.”

 As Omaha lost people to other states, peer metro areas that gained domestic migrants included Knoxville, Tennessee and Tulsa, Oklahoma, according to Census data.
In Tulsa, a program that has paid more than 3,400 remote workers $10,000 each to move there and diversify the workforce reportedly has returned four times its investment to the local economy.
According to the Knoxville News Sentinel, transplants consistently say they were drawn to that metro area by job opportunity, lifestyle change and affordable cost of living. The state of Tennessee does not levy a personal income tax.
According to the Aksarben study conducted by Development Counsellors International, the Omaha metro’s employment level barely grew over the past five years, inching up from 500,000 in 2019 to 512,000 last year. DCI said Lincoln’s employment and wage growth were nearly the same as Omaha’s.
A comparison group of metros, in contrast, grew jobs five times faster. The group: Colorado Springs, Des Moines, Fayetteville, Sioux Falls, Huntsville, Alabama, Raleigh, North Carolina and Boise, Idaho. 
Bradford said the new Strengthening Nebraska Families nonprofit aims to educate and provoke conversation about declining discretionary income for families. The DCI study and Aksarben leaders point to recruitment and development of “primary” jobs as a goal.  
Defined in the report as positions that pay above-average wages and produce goods or services for markets beyond the local area, primary jobs bring new wealth and dollars into the local and state economy. They also lead to creation of additional jobs in secondary sectors, such as medical, local banks, car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants.
Losing young adults to other states comes at a high price, the experts say, as those out-migrants build families and future workforce elsewhere.
 Forum highlights 

Among other highlights shared at the City of Omaha-organized meeting at Creighton University campus:

Brain drain, or net out-migration of Nebraskans with a bachelor’s degree or more, has persisted since 2010, with losses of 1,104 people in 2010, 4,610 in 2022 and 3,622 in 2023. 
The Omaha metro area is growing in population due to births and immigration, surpassing the million-person mark, according to Census data released earlier this year. However, for domestic migration, the state’s largest metro loses 723 people annually, according to UNO’s analysis of Census data between 2020 to 2024. 
Meanwhile, the Tulsa metro posted annual domestic migration gains of about 26,000; Kansas City about 8,000, Des Moines nearly 17,000. The Lincoln metro’s annual net domestic loss was 1,720.
Top places from where new Omahans came in recent years: Lincoln metro area, Asia, Europe, Sioux City metro area and the Des Moines metro area.

Experts on the “We Make Omaha’s Talent x Place” panel moderated by Omaha planner Sydney Embray also included Laurel Oetken of Open Range; Tammy Green of Metropolitan Community College and Dell Gines of International Economic Development Council.
The survey also asked about diversity, equity and inclusion programs. (Courtesy of UNO Center for Public Affairs Research)
Gines encouraged less emphasis on population growth and more on creating a distinct identity and quality of life improvements.
Green advocated for investment in growing skills for existing young populations and creating welcoming environments. 
Oetken said young generations seek an inviting entrepreneurial and tech ecosystem.
 Lessons learned

Aksarben’s Bradford said lessons can be learned from cities like Tulsa and the Kansas City’s Overland Park area, which attracted a new Fiserv strategic fintech hub by offering an incentives package that helped secure a commitment of 2,000 new jobs. 
Kansas is giving Fiserv more than $154 million in state incentives over the ten years, the Kansas City Star reported, and the city puts the average salary at $125,000.
“We have to do these kinds of things to compete or we’ll have no opportunities for success,” Bradford said. “Or we can do nothing and see how that goes.”



What survey-takers said
Omaha planners analyzed responses to the unscientific poll last week. Among results:

Is Omaha doing enough to retain talent? On a scale of 1 to 10, only 9 of 69 responses were above midpoint.
Think of someone you know who has left Omaha. Why did they leave? After jobs, opportunity and diversity/belonging came recreation/amenities/culture, transportation/walkability, political climate.

If you were to leave Omaha, what would be the main reason? After jobs and opportunities came transportation/walkability, culture/amenities/recreation; political climate, housing/livability.

(Getty Images)Idahoans have a week to pick or switch health insurance plans on the state’s exchange, as open enrollment for Your Health Idaho ends Dec. 15.
And unless Congress extends tax credits that deeply subsidize health insurance costs, Idahoans’ average premiums are expected to double on the exchange next year, possibly prompting thousands to cancel their policies. 
It’ll take time to see the full impact. Idahoans usually enroll in insurance plans on the exchange during the last week of open enrollment, Your Health Idaho Executive Director Pat Kelly said in an interview last week.
“Last year, we saw more than half of our enrollment occurred in the last seven days of open enrollment, and a third of that occurs on the very last day. So it’s always a little bit hard to tell where we will ultimately end up until we are completely done with open enrollment,” he told the Idaho Capital Sun.
On Thursday, the U.S. Senate is expected to vote on a bill by Democrats that would extend the enhanced premium tax credits for three years. But the bill likely doesn’t have enough bipartisan support to pass, States Newsroom reported. 
In Idaho, Kelly expects 25,000 people will cancel their policies if the subsidies aren’t renewed. About 87% of the roughly 116,000 Idahoans who have insurance through the state exchange get the enhanced tax credits, according to a report by the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The enhanced premium tax credits ensure people don’t pay more than 8.5% of their income on health insurance for benchmark plans.

Almost 60% of Americans enrolled in health insurance through Affordable Care Act marketplaces say they can’t afford a $300 annual rise in their premiums, a poll released last week by the nonpartisan health organization KFF found. 
The federal government shut down after a health care clash. In Idaho, the stakes are high.

The premium prices on Your Health Idaho for health insurance plans assume that the tax credits will expire, Kelly said. Already, he said, there are signs that affordability is a big concern for Idahoans as people are downgrading plan types, more people disenrolling citing affordability as the reason, and agents and brokers saying clients are trying to wait to see what happens.
But he’s encouraging Idahoans to not wait, and instead enroll now.
“We’re encouraging agents to ensure that their clients enroll in a plan that works for their budget today and, of course, meets their medical needs — knowing that if things change, we’ll make sure that they have an opportunity to receive all the savings that they’re eligible for,” Kelly said. “And of course, if that means an opportunity to change plans or enroll, we would certainly do everything we can to make that available to Idahoans.”
 How to get help enrolling in insurance through Your Health Idaho

There are several resources to get help enrolling in health insurance plans through Your Health Idaho, including:

Calling customer support at Your Health Idaho at 855-944-3246. The line is staffed from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekdays, and from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on Saturday. 
Finding an agent or broker online. 
Finding an enrollment event near you online.
Using an affordability calculator online to explore plans. 

 How much are premiums rising?

Here’s a few examples of how Idaho households could be affected, based on estimates from Your Health Idaho:

A family of four that earns $130,000 a year would see their annual premiums rise by $10,831 a year. Because they earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, they wouldn’t be eligible for tax credits if the enhanced credits expire. Losing tax credits would cost them $7,800 a year, and their separate premium raise would cost them another $3,031 a year. 
A couple that earns $85,000 a year would see their premiums jump by $18,600 a year. They’d also lose credits, because they earn more than 400% of the federal poverty level, which is the cutoff for the smaller tax credits created through the Affordable Care Act.

But on one recent Saturday, owner Juan Castelan gestured in the direction of mostly empty tables.  
Business is down 30% to 40% since the Memphis Safe Task Force began making thousands of traffic stops and arrests for alleged criminal and immigration law violations in September. 
Castelan has had to cut hours for his full-time kitchen and waitstaff to 25 or 28 per week, from 40.
It is common to hear sirens and witness federal and state officers conducting traffic stops and making arrests multiple times a day through the restaurant’s floor-to-ceiling windows, he said.
Business is down more than 30% at La Guadalupana since th Memphis Safe Task Force arrived, said owner Juan Castelan (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“The Hispanic community just sees all these police and says, ‘OK, nobody else is going outside’ so they just stay home,” he said. 
Across town on Beale Street, the city’s neon-lit entertainment district, blues bars and Memphis barbecue restaurants sat near empty at 9 p.m. on the Friday night before Thanksgiving. 
“I work on Beale Street and it is dead,” said Joe Calhoun, who operates the Withers Collection Museum, a designated landmark on the U.S. Civil Rights Trail.
Calhoun said museum attendance has been down since January due to a perception of crime in Memphis, the impetus cited in a presidential memo establishing the task for to restore “law and order” to the city through “hypervigilant policing” 
But the constant presence of Tennessee National Guard patrolling Beale Street and news coverage of arrests is deterring visitors, he said.
Attendance at the museum has dropped as much as 50% this fall as foot traffic dwindled even further along the three-block entertainment district.
“Everyone, unilaterally, is saying business is flat.” said Calhoun, a member of the Beale Street Merchants Association.
The Task Force is having a similar economic impact on local businesses as the COVID pandemic, said Shelby County Mayor Lee Harris, who is challenging the constitutionality of the Guard deployment in court.
“Nobody is going downtown right now with all of this going on,” Harris said. “I mean it’s tough for people to justify going to Target, when you’ve got men in military fatigues protecting Target, and I guess I put protection in quotation marks.”
Harris said the chilling effect of the Task Force presence has extended to attendance at many public activities, particularly for Memphis’ Latino community, he said. 
“Everyone is just waiting and hoping that some of this dragnet reduces so they can go out, particularly Latino communities. Latino communities are frozen,” he said. 
“People can’t go to church; people can’t go to the extracurricular activities for their children…People in some cases are afraid to go look for a job because they’re afraid they might get caught up in a dragnet.”
Supporters of the Task Force, including Gov. Bill Lee and Republican lawmakers, have touted its success in taking criminals off the streets.

Data released by the Task Force shows 3500 arrests and over 39,000 traffic stops since it began operations in late September.
“This is how we restore law and order in Memphis,” said Sen. Brent Taylor, a Republican representing parts of Shelby County, said last week, citing a Tennessee Bureau of Investigation report confirming crime in Memphis was at a 25-year low before the Task Force operation began. 
The Task Force presence has stressed small business owners in other ways, said Mauricio Calvo, president and CEO of Latino Memphis. 
Calvo and his colleagues now routinely see Tennessee Highway Patrol cars and dark SUVs driven by federal immigration agents parked outside a popular Mexican restaurant across the street from their office. 
“The first time it happened, it really freaked us out,” said Calvo who, along with a staff immigration attorney, rushed to the restaurant to provide legal aid to restaurant workers.

It soon became apparent that the law enforcement officials were dining at the restaurant, not making arrests. 
Memphis restaurants have been called out on social media and threatened with boycotts for serving meals to Task Force members, but Calvo said owners he has spoken to feel they have no choice: refusing service could make them a target of the Task Force.
“It is such a humiliating thing,” serving Task Force members, he said. “I mean, I wish they could understand what this means to the workers there, to the people, to us as a community.”
Restaurants, retail, construction and other sectors have also contended with workers unwilling to come to work for fear they could be detained, he said.
“This may sound stereotypical, but Latinos are an important part of the essential workers, construction workers, landscaping, hospitality, where people are not showing up to work right now,” he said.
Calhoun, the Beale Street museum operator, said he has had to accommodate the heightened concern of his own staff.
“My maintenance people and my housekeepers are Hispanic. They’re afraid to come to work. They will only come to work in the middle of the day because they’re afraid to come at night.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Columbia’s City Council is considering a bill that would raise water rates up to 20% per year for five years to pay for a new, more drought- and disaster-resistant intake from the Duck River and a water treatment plant.
The rate increase would affect Columbia Power and Water System’s 27,000 customers, and would impact customers of other nearby water systems that purchase water from Columbia Power and Water Systems. Columbia’s water utility currently sells water wholesale to systems in Maury County, Spring Hill, Mount Pleasant, which serve roughly 35,000 customers combined.
Columbia Power and Water Systems also requested the City Council increase its water impact fee, a fee paid by new water customers to help cover the costs associated with increased demand.
The rate and impact fee increases would allow Columbia’s water utility to secure federal and state low-interest, long term loans needed to finance the majority of the $520 million project. Those loans require substantial “stress tests” to ensure the utility will be able to pay back the funds in a timely manner, Columbia Power and Water Systems President and CEO Jonathan Hardin said, so anticipated growth in the utility’s customer base and increased income from higher new customer impact fees can’t be considered in the loan process. 










What we see here today is the opposite: existing ratepayers being asked to subsidize decades of unplanned, uncoordinated, reactive growth … Now, what we’re facing is a plan that puts more straws into the Duck River, a river that’s already under stress.


– Gabe Howard, Columbia City Council


Several members of the public, including Maury County commissioners who spoke about the potential impact to their constituents, urged the council to pause and consider any other options that would place less burden on citizens, particularly those on fixed incomes.
Gabe Howard, who represents District 8 on the Maury County Commission, said he supports the higher impact fee proposal, but that the fee should have been raised years ago to better distribute the costs of system expansion among those that contributed to increased demand.
“We say often that growth should pay for growth, but the fact is, it doesn’t, and it never has,” Howard said. “What we see here today is the opposite: existing ratepayers being asked to subsidize decades of unplanned, uncoordinated, reactive growth … Now, what we’re facing is a plan that puts more straws into the Duck River, a river that’s already under stress.”
Howard said the compounded effect of an annual 20% rate increase would add up to 150% over five years — an “unprecedented … heavy burden” for Maury County’s families, farmers and small businesses.
Water wars: groups challenge ‘unsustainable’ withdrawals from Duck River

“Yes, this increase on a percentage basis is high,” Hardin said, but the 20% per year rate increase represents a worst-case scenario.
“Every dollar we actually do collect (from impact fees and growth) will directly reduce rate needs, and we expect to see lower-percentage increases in years three, four and five,” he said.
Vice Mayor Randy McBroom said Columbia Power and Water System would have to come to the council every year with an independent study to set the annual rate increase.
The council reviewed the proposals during a study session on Thursday, ahead of the bills’ first consideration on Dec. 10. Public hearings for the bills would be scheduled for Jan. 8, 2026.
Should the project’s funding plan be approved in January, work would begin in Spring 2026 and complete around summer 2029.
Water woes
Columbia Power and Water System draws its water supply from the Duck River, a scenic river packed with ecological diversity that also serves as the main water source for the fast-growing southern Middle Tennessee region. But droughts and increasing demand for larger water withdrawals have put additional stress on the river. 
Gov. Bill Lee issued an executive order in November 2024 creating an advisory group tasked with identifying ways to protect the river while addressing water needs. The group issued its first recommendations last month, including a feasibility study for a pipeline to the Tennessee River and raising the level of the reservoir created by the Normandy Dam to collect more water during the wet seasons. 
Plans for the new intake site and treatment plant have been underway for a decade, Hardin said.
The Tennessee Valley Authority first issued a report citing the need for a downstream intake to meet the growing region’s water needs in 2001, Hardin said. The Duck River Agency echoed this finding in a 2011 report.
Columbia Power and Water System’s current intake withdraws up to 20 million gallons of water per day from the Duck River at the Riverside Drive intake. The proposed project would move the intake location downstream, and increase the utility’s withdrawal to up to 32 million gallons of water per day.
Hardin recounted the detrimental effects of severe droughts in 1988 and between 2007 and 2008. The Riverside Drive intake also relies on the Riverside Dam, a concrete structure erected in the 1920s that is “nearing the end of its useful life,” he said. 
Environmental group calls for water conservation as drought saps Duck River

Extreme rain events like Hurricane Helene also put the dam at risk of failure, Hardin added. Relocating the intake downstream “to a location that would prove capable and resilient during a 1988 drought event, while protecting the sensitive Duck River ecology” would address those problems, he said.
Permits for the project have already been approved by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation and the project received a favorable biological opinion from the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency in March. Columbia Power and Water Systems began acquiring the land easements necessary for the project soon after, and have since secured about 60%. The remaining easements should be secured by Jan. 1, Hardin said.
Jason Gilliam — chair of the Maury County Republican Party, a member of the Maury County Water System Board, and a leader of a group advocating for the construction of a new dam in Columbia — urged the council to consider postponing the decision while others consider alternate ways to source water. Gilliam cited a proposed expansion of an ongoing pipeline project from H.B. & T.S. Utility District in Williamson County.
Columbia Mayor Chaz Molder said his overarching question is the cost of inaction. 
Should the rate increase not pass council approval, Hardin said the utility would serve the “modest amount of excess capacity” it maintains to developers who were first in line until it hits the 20 million gallon per day cap. After that, the utility would not be able to serve any additional water needs.
“For the interest of public health and safety, we would lock everything in place, and we would maintain the status quo,” Hardin said. The utility would “certainly revisit our wholesale obligations, and somebody like Spring Hill who has other options available to them would not receive the same priority as an entity that only gets the water directly (from Columbia Power and Water Systems).”

John Hickenlooper in 2026, aiming to ride a wave of liberal and progressive dissatisfaction with Democratic leadership to an upset primary victory.
Gonzales’ announcement, rumored for weeks, sets up a clash in Colorado between a leading progressive voice at the state Legislature and a business-friendly moderate who has been a fixture in Colorado politics for roughly three decades.
In an interview, Gonzales called the 2026 midterm elections “a defining moment for the future of the Democratic Party.”
“What sort of party do we want to be?” Gonzales said. “Do we want to send back John Hickenlooper, a go-along-to-get-along incrementalist, or do we want to send a proven legislator, with a track record of taking on big fights against a well-funded corporate lobby, who’s gotten s*** done?”

Gonzales said Hickenlooper has failed to offer a “bold and fierce critique” of President Donald Trump’s second term agenda, faulting him for his votes earlier this year to confirm many of Trump’s Cabinet appointees. The path forward for Democrats after a bitter defeat in the 2024 election, she argued, is to embrace “policies that will have transformative impacts on everyday working people’s lives,” like “Medicare for All” and universal child care.
“The work begins day one, to remind folks that we can actually have nice things — you just need people willing to fight for them,” Gonzales said. “We have the opportunity to get the profit motive out of our health care system, and to enact universal health care. We have the opportunity to enact universal care for children, for elders. It requires us to reassess our policy priorities.”
Hickenlooper, a former brewpub entrepreneur and real estate developer, was elected mayor of Denver in 2003 and served two terms as Colorado governor beginning in 2011. During an ill-fated 2020 presidential campaign, he insisted he was “not cut out to be a senator,” but months later acquiesced to party leadership’s efforts to recruit him to challenge former GOP Sen. Cory Gardner, whom he went on to defeat soundly to help Democrats capture a razor-thin Senate majority.
Hickenlooper was among a group of 22 Democrats and Republicans who crafted the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, championing provisions to expand broadband access and boost investment in electric vehicle charging stations, and he was credited by activists with keeping alive the negotiations that ultimately led to Democrats’ passage of billions in spending to fight climate change in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act.
He would be 80 years old by the end of another six-year Senate term, which he has said would be his last. In an interview with 9News in April, Hickenlooper said that while he had considered passing the torch to a new generation, his breadth of experience as a mayor, a governor and a small business owner brings a “unique and valuable perspective to making decisions.”

The winner of the June 30 Democratic Senate primary will be heavily favored to win in the general election in November. Republicans have not won a statewide race in Colorado since 2016. Historical precedent, early polling data and special election results this year all suggest the party faces strong headwinds in the 2026 midterms. Two little-known Republican U.S. Senate candidates, former state Rep. Janak Joshi and Marine Corps veteran George Markert, have raised a combined total of about $267,000 in campaign contributions, less than one-tenth of the $3.6 million war chest that Hickenlooper reported at the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission disclosures.
Gonzales, who began her career as a community organizer before running for the state Senate in 2018, expects much of that financial firepower to now be directed at her.
“I expect them to throw everything that they’ve got at me, but that’s not going to stop me. I have never backed down from a fight,” she said. “We might not outraise John Hickenlooper — we’ll sure as hell outwork him.”
Calls for generational change
It’s extremely rare for a sitting U.S. senator to be unseated by a primary challenge, though that rarity is a relatively recent development.
In 18 regularly scheduled elections between 1946 and 1980, a total of 36 Senate incumbents were defeated in primary elections, according to data compiled by the Brookings Institution. But in the 22 federal elections held since then, it’s happened just eight times. The last senator to suffer such a fate was former GOP Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana in 2012.
Gonzales’ Senate bid is more than just a challenge to Hickenlooper — it’s a breach of protocol within a Democratic Party that has, both at the national level and in Colorado specifically, placed a heavy premium on deference to seniority and the appearance of party comity.
Colorado’s strong Democratic bench includes three rising-star U.S. House members in their forties and plenty of prominent up-and-comers at the state and local levels. But twice in recent years — in Hickenlooper’s switch to the 2020 Senate race, and fellow U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet’s unexpected run for governor in 2026 — a decision by a more senior party figure has largely cleared the field and put an end to announced and rumored candidacies by younger hopefuls.
Gonzales, 42, would be the first woman elected to the U.S. Senate from Colorado, and the first Latina elected to any statewide office.
“I’ve worked hard, and I’ve followed all the rules — but I am not willing to sit around and wait for the boys’ club to say, now it’s time for a woman to run,” she said.
Calls for generational change within the Democratic Party have grown louder in the wake of a 2024 election loss widely attributed to former President Joe Biden’s failure to withdraw from the race earlier than he did. Criticism of the party’s “gerontocracy” may have reached a tipping point in 2025, a year during which three Democratic U.S. House members died in office — leaving their seats empty at a time when the GOP majority advanced its sweeping tax and spending bill by a one-vote margin.
At least three longtime House Democrats — former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Reps. Jerry Nadler of New York and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois — announced their retirements in recent months after drawing young primary challengers who voiced explicit concerns about their ages. In Massachusetts, 79-year-old Sen. Ed Markey faces a primary challenge from 47-year-old Rep. Seth Moulton, and in Maine, polls show first-time candidate Graham Platner, 41, with an early advantage over two-term incumbent Gov. Janet Mills, party leadership’s pick to take on GOP Sen. Susan Collins.
Three other lesser-known Democratic candidates — attorney Karen Breslin, software engineer Brashad Hasley and accountant A.J. Zimpfer — have also formally filed to run against Hickenlooper. To qualify for the Senate primary ballot, candidates can either submit 12,000 valid petition signatures by March 18 or win support from at least 30% of delegates at the 2026 state party assembly, scheduled for March 28 in Pueblo.
“I’ve seen hundreds of thousands of Coloradans take to the streets to proclaim ‘No Kings,'” Gonzales said, referring to this year’s nationwide anti-Trump demonstrations. “There is no guarantee for any elected official — you have to earn those votes. I think that when primary voters in Colorado have the opportunity to weigh in about the future of the leadership that they want representing them in Washington, D.C., they will support my candidacy.”
Different political eras
Gonzales said she first seriously considered a Senate bid during a special legislative session in August, when Colorado lawmakers were called back to the Capitol to close a billion-dollar budget gap triggered by congressional Republicans’ passage of their tax and spending law.
After two four-year terms representing Senate District 34, which includes much of north, west and downtown Denver, Gonzales is term-limited in 2026. She currently serves as chair of the Senate Judiciary and Ethics committees. Her proudest legislative accomplishments, she said, include sponsoring the Reproductive Health Equity Act, an abortion-rights law passed before the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2022 reversal of Roe v. Wade, and two immigrants rights bills — House Bill 19-1124 and Senate Bill 25-276 — that she said helped protect Colorado from overreach by Trump’s immigration authorities.
“Both are times when (some) Democrats — some of my more moderate colleagues, some of my more incrementalist colleagues — would say, ‘This is a lot. This is too hard to do,'” Gonzales said.
As governor, Hickenlooper presided over a much different era of state politics — one in which Republicans frequently controlled at least one chamber of the Legislature, along with the offices of attorney general and secretary of state. His moderate stances often frustrated many within his party, especially when it came to energy and environmental issues, which roiled the state during the 2010s fracking boom that coincided with his governorship.
An August poll by Magellan Strategies found that 49% of Coloradans disapproved of Hickenlooper’s job performance, compared to 37% who approved. A separate poll found that his favorability rating had declined to 43% last month from 49% in March.
Colorado’s increasing Democratic lean has made Hickenlooper an outlier in the Senate, a Newsline analysis found earlier this year. During the first three months of 2025, he voted with Trump and Republicans nearly 30% of the time despite representing a state that voted against Trump by 11 percentage points. No other Democratic senator had a voting record that was more at odds with their state’s partisan vote share.
After years of community organizing work, Gonzales won the District 34 primary in 2018 with 64% of the vote, after winning endorsements from progressive groups including the Working Families Party and the Denver Democratic Socialists of America. She joined the DSA in 2018, because they were “engaging young people in a manner that I hadn’t seen take place in years,” she said, though her membership has since lapsed. She cited New York City Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani’s victory last month, however, along with wins for progressives at the local level in Colorado, as evidence that Democrats need to propose policy solutions that “meet the scale of the problems that we face.”
“Across the country, we saw progressives who led with their values, and who were unapologetic about being fighters for the working class, win,” Gonzales said.
It’s the same lesson that she takes from her tenure in the Legislature, where Democrats, despite frequent predictions of a backlash from voters, have been able to build durable majorities in both the House and Senate.
“Colorado is a blue state, and at the state Capitol, we have led,” Gonzales said. “We need that same type of partner in Washington, D.C., who is willing to be bold, unapologetic and relentless — and I’ve done that my entire career.”

(Photo by Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)Some North Dakota farmers are owed money after a large bankruptcy filing by a Nebraska-based grain dealer. 
The North Dakota Department of Agriculture says farmers in the state are owed more than $900,000 by the Hansen-Mueller Co. 
The bankruptcy affects creditors in multiple states, including South Dakota and Minnesota. Creditors also include a trucking company in North Dakota.
David Barrett is a Bismarck ag law attorney with clients that include some of the North Dakota farmers who will be filing claims. 
He has clients in other states, too, and has already filed a $1.2 million claim for a grain elevator in Mississippi.

“There’s creditors everywhere,” Barrett said, with more filings to come. 
Hansen-Mueller leases a grain storage facility in Grand Forks and has a roving grain buyers license in the state. As part of being licensed in the state, it also would have to secure a bond to help ensure it can pay for grain it has purchased. 
However, the company filed for bankruptcy Nov. 17, before the Department of Agriculture could begin insolvency proceedings. Those proceedings could have allowed the state to access the company’s bond to help repay farmers.
Shaun Quissell, director of the Grain and Livestock Division for the state Ag Department, said Hansen-Mueller was bonded for about $778,000 — less than what is owed. 
The state also has a credit sales indemnity fund, which helps protect farmers from fraudulent buyers. 
Quissell also said the grain purchase agreements between Hansen-Mueller and the farmers were not credit sales contracts and would not have been covered by that fund. 
Because the company declared bankruptcy, the bond money could become part of the bankruptcy proceeding, Quissell said. 
Most of the North Dakota transactions involved oats, Quissell said. He did not have information on how many growers were affected. 
Barrett said the farmers he’s aware of being owed money are in the Red River Valley. 
In a news release, state Agriculture Commissioner Doug Goehring encouraged farmers affected by the Hansen-Mueller bankruptcy to file claims with the bankruptcy court. 
“Every producer who is owed money by Hansen-Mueller should be receiving notification from the bankruptcy court that they are a claimant and need to file a claim,” Goehring said. “We understand the producer’s frustration and are here to provide clear information to help those affected.”
Bankruptcy information can be found at https://dm.epiq11.com/case/hansenmueller/info or by calling 877-717-1702.  
In a news release announcing the bankruptcy, Hansen-Mueller said it hoped to find a buyer to continue operations. 
Hansen-Mueller operates nine grain elevators, including five across the Midwest along Interstate 29. Its Minnesota operations include a facility at the Duluth port on Lake Superior.

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)The vote total for state Rep. Aftyn Behn in the Tennessee 7th Congressional District race against now-U.S. Rep. Matt Van Epps show Democrats have narrowed their deficit to Republicans but not enough to flip any seats, an analysis of election data by the Lookout finds.
The racet to watch in the 2026 election is Tennessee Congressional District 5, currently held by Columbia Republican U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles. He’s won about 56% of the vote in the past two elections, the lowest of any Tennessee Republican who won their U.S. House race.
Behn performed better in every county in District 7 in 2025 when compared to the Democratic candidates in 2024 or 2022. But if the same shifts in Nashville, Williamson County and rural counties that happened in District 7 on the Dec. 2 special election occurred in the 5th district, the Democratic candidate would lose by 4 to 7 percentage points.
Kent Syler, a political science professor at Middle Tennessee State University, said based on his look at the election data, he came up with a similar number, but cautioned that the 2026 midterms are still 11 months away and a lot could happen.
“The biggest issue will be President Donald Trump’s popularity,” Syler said. “Midterms are always about the President.”
President Donald Trump’s approval rating is 36%, according to Gallup.
Trump’s approval rating is at its lowest since he returned to office in January, driven down by many voters who disapprove of the President’s handling of the economy and inflation.
In 2022, state Republicans redrew Tennessee’s U.S. Congressional map, dividing Nashville across three districts and successfully eliminating a Democratic-held seat in the old version of the 5th Distric — a seat held by Democrats from post-Reconstruction until Ogles’ 2022 election.
By cracking the district, Republicans narrowed their margins in districts 5, 6 and 7, which political analysts warned could make two of those districts competitive in a bad electoral year for Republicans.
U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles won’t run away from his association with President Donald Trump even if Trump’s popularity continues to decline, one expert predicts. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)
“The shift we saw in the 7th district is the same one we saw in New Jersey and Virginia earlier this year,” said John Geer, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. “All the Republicans should be fearful.”
During the campaign, both candidates ran on affordability, recognizing that the cost of living has become a top priority for voters.
Van Epps madeclear during his election night speech that he didn’t blame Trump for economic issues and believed the president’s support in his race boosted his chances of winning.
“Tonight, you sent a clear message loud and clear,” Van Epps said. “The people of Middle Tennessee stand proudly behind President Donald Trump.”
Geer said Van Epps’ praise of Trump showed a potential problem for Republicans. To win close elections in 2026, candidates might need to separate themselves from the president, but “Trump won’t let them.”
“Ogles definitely won’t run away from Trump,” Geer said.

Stebbins
We are told we face a difficult choice: protect our water or secure our energy. This is a false narrative, manufactured by a foreign corporation and its allies to disguise their illegal occupation of our Great Lakes. The real choice before us, and the urgent duty before our state officials, is between upholding the law or capitulating to corporate power.
My remarks are directed to those in Lansing with the power to act.
An orderly, planned shutdown of Line 5 is not a concession; it is an affirmation. It is how we uphold the laws that protect the Public Trust Doctrine enshrined in our state constitution. It is how we defend state sovereignty by enforcing our Governor’s valid revocation of an easement that a corporation continues to violate with impunity. It is how we honor Tribal sovereignty and treaty rights, respecting the original stewards of these waters whose survival and culture are non-negotiable.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Critically, moving forward with a shutdown is how we boost jobs and domestic energy security. Since the Snyder administration, studies have confirmed that alternatives exist, but corporate greed has blinded our decision makers. Shutting Line 5 means investing in Michigan labor to build and maintain modern, safer energy infrastructure, not relying on a 70-year-old line in the heart of our Straits to send Canadian oil to foreign markets. True energy independence is built on innovation and resilience, not on doubling down on a risky, outdated conduit.
Yet, we are trapped in a cycle of unreasonable court delays, a strategy employed by Enbridge to run out the clock and amplify their threats to our communities. Every day our state wavers in its political will to enforce its own laws is a day we normalize this illegality.
This moment sets a national precedent. If Michigan, surrounded by the world’s greatest freshwater system, cannot summon the courage to prioritize the Great Lakes over a Canadian oil giant’s profits, what state can? We are signaling to every corporation that they can defy environmental orders, manipulate legal systems, and place their infrastructure above the public interest. As a wave of data centers enters the chat, Enbridge is paving their way for lawlessness. We are telling our citizens and Tribal nations that their rights are secondary to corporate convenience.
We do not need more grandstanding. We need the bold leadership that was promised when the shutdown was ordered. We need leaders who see that enforcing the law is the pro-jobs, pro-sovereignty, and pro-American energy path.
The call is clear. Use every tool of State government to end this illegal occupation and manage a transition that protects our water and our workers. Demonstrate to the nation that when the health of the Great Lakes and the rule of law are at stake, Michigan will lead.
Our Great Lakes are not a bargaining chip. They are the foundation of our identity, economy, and future. Upholding the law to protect them isn’t a threat to our prosperity, it is its very source.
The political will to act now is the only leadership worthy of this moment and this magnificent trust.

(Photo by Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)The two candidates for next chief justice of the North Dakota Supreme Court have a vision for a better-resourced and more efficient judiciary.
Justices Lisa Fair McEvers and Jerod Tufte are vying for the role after Jon Jensen announced last month he will step down at the end of 2025.
The chief justice is selected by a vote of the Supreme Court and state district court judges. 
The court system will count the ballots and announce a winner Wednesday.
The chief justice is responsible for handling some court-related administrative duties, in addition to serving as the public face of North Dakota’s judicial system. The chief has no more voting power on the court than the other justices.
“The description that has been used over the years is, the chief justice is the leader among equals,” Jensen said.
This is Tufte’s first time running for chief justice. Fair McEvers previously sought the position in 2019.

Fair McEvers
Fair McEvers said her career in the North Dakota court system dates back to 1987, when she began working in court administration for the Northeast Judicial District.
“I kind of know the history going back a long ways,” she said of the state’s judiciary.
Fair McEvers said the job sparked her interest in the law and inspired her to become an attorney. She graduated from the University of North Dakota Law School in 1997.
She went on to serve as assistant state’s attorney for Cass County and commissioner of the North Dakota Department of Labor from 2005 to 2010. Fair McEvers then served as a judge in the East Central Judicial District in Fargo.
She became a justice in 2014 when she was appointed by former Gov. Jack Dalrymple to fill a vacancy left by former Justice Mary Muehlen Maring. Fair McEvers was then elected to the court to serve a two-year term in 2016 and a 10-year term in 2018.
North Dakota abortion ban deemed constitutional in split opinion from state Supreme Court

Fair McEvers is the fourth woman to serve on the North Dakota Supreme Court. She said one of the most gratifying parts of her job is being a role model to young people.
“I want people to see that women can do this job and do it well,” Fair McEvers said.
If elected chief justice, she said she would look for ways to increase resources for district court judges.
“I know how busy they are, and how hard it is to find time to write the opinions and do the research and do all that by yourself,” Fair McEvers said.
One of her priorities would be eliminating judicial referee positions in state courts, she said. Judicial referees are attorneys that are available to decide certain cases — including juvenile, small claims and traffic court cases — on behalf of district court judges. There are five in the state.
Fair McEvers said she thinks the court system should invest in more judge positions rather than  continuing to keep judicial referees part of the court system.
“The judicial referees are very good, don’t get me wrong, but folks have a right to have their case heard by a district judge,” she said.
She said she wouldn’t want to take anyone’s job away, but would support phasing the referee positions out gradually.

Tufte 
Before he became an attorney, Tufte was a software engineer. After graduating from Arizona State University College of Law in 2002, he worked on patent and licensing issues for tech companies, he said.
Tufte also clerked for a judge on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals and was the state’s attorney for Kidder County and Sheridan County. He served as legal counsel for Republican Gov. Jack Dalrymple from 2011 to 2014, and went on to become a judge in the Southeast Judicial District in Valley City.
Tufte was elected to the Supreme Court in 2016.
He described himself as an admirer of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, particularly Thomas’ belief that the U.S. Constitution should be interpreted based on how its authors would have understood it at the time of its adoption. The legal theory, often referred to as “originalism,” has been invoked by Thomas and other conservative U.S. Supreme Court justices in landmark decisions like the overturning of Roe v. Wade in 2022.
“He’s just got this courage to admit that maybe the court’s been wrong from time to time,” Tufte said of Thomas.
Tufte said one of his objectives is to empower the court system to experiment with artificial intelligence.
He chairs the North Dakota judiciary’s artificial intelligence task force, and said he would want to continue in that position if elected chief justice. He’s also on a task force that’s exploring ways  to address North Dakota’s shortage of lawyers.
Tufte said his experience in the governor’s office would help the court collaborate with other branches of government to achieve its policy goals.
“The chief justice needs to be able to build bridges with different factions,” he said. “That’s what I bring to the table.”
Both Fair McEvers and Tufte said they would continue many initiatives started under Jensen’s leadership, including the ongoing effort to make all clerks of court state employees. Some clerks are still county employees, a holdover from when county courts and district courts were separate. The courts merged in the 1990s.
Fair McEvers and Tufte took opposing views on the court’s recent 3-2 decision on the state’s near-total abortion ban. The majority opinion, which Fair McEvers joined, found the law unconstitutional. Tufte authored the dissenting opinion. Since it takes a vote of four justices to declare a law unconstitutional, the law was upheld.

Jensen
Jensen’s predecessors, former justices Gerald VandeWalle and Ralph Erickstad, served as chief justice for a combined 45 years. Their decades-long service was unusual, however, Jensen said. He said before their terms as chief, the position “rotated fairly frequently.”
Most of the chief’s work pertains to “day-to-day management issues,” Jensen said. The chief justice typically decides minor legal matters that don’t need to go before the full court, for instance, and is also responsible for appointments to some committees and work groups, he said.

The chief represents the judicial system on special occasions, including delivering the state of the judiciary address at each legislative session.
“The role of chief justice can be as easy or hard as the chief justice wants it to be,” Jensen said. “You can take on challenges to improve the judicial system, or alternatively, you can sit in the ceremonial role.”
He noted in a letter announcing his resignation that the court system has added three new judges and 29 full-time employees under his tenure, in addition to working to increase district judge salaries.
Jensen said part of the reason he’s not seeking reelection is because he wants to spend more time with his family. He felt it was time to yield the role to someone who can commit more energy to it, he said. Jensen will continue serving as a justice.
“I really do believe that if you’re in a position of leadership, you need to use that leadership to make whatever you’re leading better,” Jensen said.

These situations are only a few of the reasons why the news about abandoned U.S.–funded contraceptives overseas is so alarming. This action blatantly reflects the same disregard for women’s health that now shapes national policy. And that disregard lands directly on women’s bodies. 
Under the Trump administration, the U.S. government ordered the destruction of nearly $10 million worth of U.S.–funded contraceptives, based on the false claim that birth control is an “abortifacient.” This claim is absolutely nonsensical. Contraception doesn’t end a pregnancy — it prevents one. Unfortunately, ideology, and not medicine, guided that decision, leaving lifesaving, taxpayer‑funded medicine stalled in warehouses instead of reaching women who need it. 
The full picture is even more disturbing. Several days ago, a new report found that the Trump administration left 20 of 24 U.S.–funded contraceptive shipments to waste away in Belgian warehouses. These were fully paid-for, taxpayer-funded supplies — IUDs, implants, pills, and other reproductive health essentials — intended for women in 13 countries. This is simply appalling. 
And if you think that kind of extremism stops at the water’s edge, think again. 
Back home, I see the fallout of the same ideology driving national attacks on contraception and women. 
Already, there are over 300,000 women of reproductive age in Wisconsin in need of contraception, and attacks are making this gap even worse. 
And these gaps carry real health risks, because contraception does more than prevent pregnancy — it treats endometriosis, PCOS, severe bleeding and anemia, and it reduces the risk of reproductive cancers. 
Rural clinics that once offered contraception and family-planning visits have declined in number, a trend worsened by federal policy shifts that weaken the reproductive-health safety net and leave too many women without reliable nearby options for care.
And now, with health-insurance costs already skyrocketing for many families — and monthly bills set to jump even higher if those tax credits expire — the ACA’s no-cost contraception guarantee slips further out of reach. Road block after road block after road block. 
Fortunately, Wisconsin has leaders who understand the stakes. 
Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s leadership on the “Right to Contraception Act” reflects a truth every OB‑GYN knows: contraception saves lives. Contraception reduces maternal deaths, prevents unintended pregnancies, treats reproductive-health conditions, and empowers women to build stable lives. Baldwin fights to protect contraception — what Wisconsin women rely on every day — not because it’s politically convenient, but because she understands it’s a medical necessity. 
U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan co-sponsored the “Saving Lives and Taxpayer Dollars Act” — legislation designed to stop exactly what we’re seeing in Belgium. The bill requires that U.S.–funded food and medical supplies – like the contraception sitting in Brussels at this moment – reach the people they were purchased for, instead of being left to rot or destroyed for ideological reasons. In Washington, where too many have decided contraception is a cultural wedge rather than essential health care, Pocan’s voice matters. 
The women I see in my exam room aren’t looking for a political fight. They’re looking for care that lets them stay healthy, stay safe, and stay in control of their lives — something contraception makes possible every day. 
Jeopardizing contraception — whether through wasteful negligence abroad or political interference here at home — is harmful, cruel and simply unjust. 
We in Wisconsin cannot afford to look the other way. We need leaders who will defend the right to contraception, not undermine it. 
The stakes are simple: either we protect access to basic health care, or we allow ideology to decide who gets care — and who doesn’t. 
For the women in my clinic — and for women everywhere — contraception is essential care that strengthens their health and safeguards their freedom.

(Getty Images)It is startling to realize the eight professions the U.S. Department of Education recently announced it wants to reclassify as nonprofessional include nurses and teachers.
If reclassified, it will reduce the amount of student loans for those seeking advanced degrees. The other professions are audiologists, speech-language pathologists, occupational therapists, social workers, public health and counseling therapy. Health care in states like Idaho will be seriously damaged.
One of the interesting things about all these professions is they all require licensing and continuing education hours, adding educational costs beyond a bachelor’s or master’s.
If approved, it means these workers will have a lifetime federal student loan cap of $200,000. This will make degrees including advanced certifications or a doctorate unavailable to thousands of people.
Many bachelor’s degrees now cost a minimum of $30,000 for public college in-state tuition, $63,000 for private colleges or out-of-state tuition. The average master’s degree costs $65,000 for public schools, $88,000 for private universities; so, a $200,000 lifetime cap places further education beyond the grasp of many Americans. This is especially true of these eight professions where continuing education is essential — even required as a condition of employment — to maintain and gain necessary skills.
Because of the proposed student loan cutback, it may mean a serious shortage of people to fill jobs in health care and education, making American less healthy and more poorly educated.
For example, in rural areas throughout America, nurses who have completed nurse practitioner certification (an advanced degree) are serving rural areas where physicians are either in short supply or nonexistent. Without these professionals, people have limited ability to receive medical care without significant travel.
This also comes at a time when there is a serious shortage of nurses in the U.S., with both Washington and Idaho facing significant shortfalls in nursing care. In Washington, there is a 26 percent shortage of nurses and a 15 percent shortage in Idaho.
However, if the current trend continues, Idaho is projected by the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration to have the most serious shortage of nurses in the country by next year with a projected 62 percent of the necessary skilled nurses working. This would be a 38 percent shortfall of nurses needed.
The same is true of education with more than 411,000 K-12 teaching positions vacant and more than 1 in 8 teaching positions currently filled by uncertified teachers across the country. The shortage is especially serious in areas of high poverty with 86 percent of the nation’s school districts struggling to fill positions. In the 2023-24 school year, the Idaho Department of Education reported serious teacher shortages in elementary grades K-8, math, science, technical and career education, visual and performing arts, family and consumer science and special education.
Who will be hurt the most by these actions? Mostly people in rural areas, but everywhere it will primarily impact children, women and the elderly. If someone has a serious health issue or they want to climb out of poverty through education, they will struggle to find resources.
As a medical example, anyone who might need a hearing aid – sure, they can get one over the counter, but one that specifically addresses their unique need if they are profoundly deaf or have tinnitus? For that, they need an audiologist.
Someone who experienced a stroke and needs to re-learn how to do daily activities needs an occupational therapist. Social workers do more than deal with families, they also help vulnerable people find assistance such as housing and mental health treatment. Public health professionals create awareness of public health issues, such as illness or the dangers of certain behaviors.
When it comes to the people driven to serve in these areas as professionals, it will be women and people of color who are the majority of all these impacted groups. Changing the ability of people to serve their communities by removing advanced scholastic opportunities makes no sense.
Overall, what this plan will most likely do is decrease the already short supply of nurses, teachers, audiologist, therapists, social workers and public health professionals hurting Americans ability to be educated and healthy.
Reportedly, the U.S. Department of Education will hold hearing next year on the topic, and concerned citizens should let their opinions on this revocation of professional status be known to the Department of Education and others.

Ken Fleming is filing legislation in 2026 that would remove body mass index from treatment standards for state qualified health insurance plans marketed through kynect. (LRC Public Information)This story discusses eating disorders. If you or someone you know is at risk for an eating disorder, the National Eating Disorders Association has resources and a free screening tool at www.nationaleatingdisorders.org The National Suicide Prevention Lifeline is 988. 
Kentuckians being treated for eating disorders who gain much needed weight in treatment sometimes reach a body mass index threshold that, on paper, makes them seem healthy, triggering the end of insurance coverage for treatment.  
Louisville Republican Rep. Ken Fleming wants to change that and is filing legislation in 2026 that would remove body mass index (more commonly known as BMI) from treatment standards for state qualified health insurance plans marketed through kynect. 
A Louisville eating disorder expert said such a change is needed. 
“I’ve had this happen to me too many times to count at this point now: You will have somebody who is in treatment and who needs more treatment, but they gain a little bit of weight because they’re eating regularly, because they’re in treatment, and then the insurance company says, ‘okay, well, they don’t need treatment anymore, we’re going to discharge them right then,’” explained Cheri Levinson, an associate professor with the University of Louisville and the director of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab. 
“On the opposite end of that, you might have somebody who loses half a pound, and the insurance company says, ‘Oh, well, they need a higher level of care, so they can’t stay in your treatment program anymore,’” she added. “Essentially, as a clinician or as a clinic providing this type of treatment, you end up in this situation where any sort of movement on weight causes the insurance company to discharge them from the care that they need.”   
Fleming, who has experience running a mental health agency, said his legislation initially came from a constituent a few years ago who had issues with insurance while in treatment. 
“Once an individual reaches the BMI threshold, then coverage can be stopped. But they’re missing the point in terms of treating the mental health aspect of it,” Fleming said. “And so, once you reach that threshold there’s, I guess, an approach or thought that, ‘okay, you reached it. You’re fine. Let’s move on.’ In reality, that’s not the case. You may have gotten your body into a better spot, but you still have some elements or some issues or some challenges or some triggers or whatever it might be that could (cause) them to relapse.” 
Using BMI in general is “extremely problematic,” said Levinson: “We know that BMI is supposed to be a population based measure, not an individual indicator of health.” 
Cheri Levinson is an associate professor with the university and the director of Louisville’s Eating Anxiety Treatment (EAT) Lab. (Photo provided)
“Weight gain is only one of the characteristics that’s needed for somebody to recover from an eating disorder, and usually you’ll have people who are nutritionally restored, … their BMI might look healthy, but they’re actually still extremely cognitively sick,” she said. “Their brain has not healed yet.”  
Fleming’s bill will apply only to state qualified health plans for individuals and small groups marketed on the Affordable Care Act (ACA) exchange, he said. That will still cover a substantial number of patients, Levinson said. At least a quarter of her patients getting inpatient and outpatient treatment for eating disorders belong to such plans.  
Almost 100,000 Kentuckians purchase health insurance on the ACA marketplace but that number is expected to drop next year because of premium increases and the end of enhanced federal subsidies. Congress is considering ways to hold down costs.
‘We’re creating another crisis’
During the federal government shutdown, around 600,000 Kentuckians’ food assistance was frozen after the U.S. Department of Agriculture said in late October that it wouldn’t use contingency funds to keep SNAP benefits flowing. 
Such scarcity is directly related to eating disorders, Levinson said, making such a policy change as Fleming is suggesting timely. 
“The primary trigger for eating disorders is problematic restrictions,” she said. “People who are food insecure obviously have periods of time when they don’t have enough to eat, and not even necessarily by choice. They’re restricting, but that restriction can then trigger things like binge eating, can trigger purging, which can trigger all sorts of other problematic behaviors.” 
It’s too early to know the full impact of the SNAP benefits freeze on eating disorders in Kentucky, Levinson said. 
But: “I think that we can infer that as we see more people who are food insecure in this country, we’re going to see more people with eating disorders. We’re creating another crisis,” she said. “You’re going to have more people who are on Medicaid that have eating disorders, and (there are) limited resources for people to get treatment that have that type of health care.” 
Meanwhile, Fleming believes there is appetite to pass his bill in 2026. 
“I’ve gotten a lot of good feedback from my colleagues,” he said. “Everybody’s pretty much in agreement to …. get this through. So we seem, I think, pretty optimistic and positive about it.”

(Photo by Arshia Khan for Arkansas Advocate)The city of Tulsa is challenging an Arkansas agency’s modification of a Northwest Arkansas treatment plant’s permit that discharges into the watershed that supplies the Oklahoma city’s drinking water.
The City of Decatur’s wastewater plant receives waste from Centerton and a nearby Simmons Food plant and discharges into streams that feed Lakes Eucha and Spavinaw, from which Tulsa draws its water. Decatur entered into a consent order with the Arkansas Division of Environmental Quality last year over numerous violations of its federal Clean Water Act permit. Tulsa said the violations, which have continued since the order was signed, are reason enough to reject expanding the plant until Decatur complies with its original permit.
Tulsa has additional concerns: that the modified permit could result in higher levels of pollutants discharged into the watershed that supplies its drinking water.
The modified permit increases the plant capacity by just over 1.5 million gallons per day (MGD), to 5.36 MGD, reflecting the construction of additional capacity at the plant due to “rapidly increasing” waste flows. But Tulsa says modification shouldn’t be approved until plans for unaddressed “choke points” within the treatment plant are submitted and approved, or until a survey is completed to determine what waste pretreatment, if any, should be required.
“Decatur has no plans to increase pre-treatment or reduce the amount of wastewater which it takes from sources outside of Decatur,” Tulsa wrote in public comments on the permit in October. “The increase in flow via the permit modification should be denied until such time as Decatur can increase flow while also decreasing the total amount of phosphorus which Decatur discharges into the watershed.”
Decatur and Tulsa are parties to a 2003 federal court settlement that came after Tulsa sued Decatur and six poultry companies in 2001, alleging that discharges by the companies and the city’s wastewater plant contained phosphorus that polluted Lakes Eucha and Spavinaw, where Tulsa gets its drinking water.
Tulsa argued in its request for an administrative hearing with the Arkansas Pollution Control and Ecology Commission that the modified permit violates the 2003 settlement and that the city is “directly and negatively impacted by the issuance of [Decatur’s modified permit].” Tulsa wrote the permit is unable “to address Decatur’s long history of numerous violations of the Settlement Agreement between Tulsa and Decatur,” nor was it able to address violations under the current permit and “ADEQ’s own water quality standards.”
Administrative permit appeals are an uncommon event in recent years — this is the first filed with the commission since 2023.
A spokesperson with the city of Tulsa on Friday was unable to provide further information without speaking with Tulsa’s water utility board and the lawyers representing them in the challenge.
Tulsa’s 2001 lawsuit was separate from ongoing efforts by successive Oklahoma attorneys general to hold Arkansan poultry companies responsible in court for phosphorus pollution in the Illinois River watershed.
When contacted Friday afternoon, the mayor of Decatur said he was unable to get an Advocate reporter in touch with someone from the wastewater department by the end of the day, and that he couldn’t comment until next week.
“In Tulsa’s view increased flow into the Waste Water Treatment Plant (“WWTP”) and discharge from the Decatur WWTP will only result in greater pollution to the watershed Tulsa utilizes for clean water and result in damage to the people of Oklahoma and Northwest Arkansas,” the city wrote in its Nov. 26 hearing request.
The city wrote that DEQ did not explain how any additional phosphorus that enters the watershed as a result of the higher flow would not harm water quality in the agency’s response to Tulsa’s comments on the permit modification. It asks the pollution control commission to vacate the permit changes and find that DEQ acted “arbitrarily and capriciously and contrary to law” when it granted the change.
A spokesperson for the Department of Energy and Environment, DEQ’s parent agency, did not respond to a request for comment on the permit appeal.
Decatur has a documented history of permit violations, with two consent orders with DEQ in the last ten years. Tulsa alleges in its appeal request that “Decatur is not actively working to address any of its exceedances or deficiencies.” DEQ’s 2024 consent order “came only after years of ignoring exceedances and Decatur as yet to reach compliance. Furthermore, it confounds logic to increase the flow into the plant without the existing plant coming into full compliance,” Tulsa wrote to DEQ.
According to data from the EPA, the amount of phosphorus discharged by the plant nearly tripled between 2010 and 2024. The majority of those increases have occurred since 2020. Incomplete 2025 data shows lower amounts of phosphorus compared to 2024. That data does not yet include November or December discharge data.
But Tulsa says there are still problems. Data collected by the city from Columbia Hollow Creek, where the Decatur plant discharges treated wastewater, showed “a substantial increase in the concentration of total phosphorus and the abundance of E. coli in samples” between April 2025 and September 2025 that indicate an existing, unaddressed issue at the Decatur plant. That data was not provided in the request.
In its October comments on the DEQ modification consent order, Tulsa threatened another lawsuit if Decatur’s permit modification was not overturned.
“Granting the permit as written will absolutely result in more phosphorus in the Eucha-Spavinaw watershed, a greatly enhanced risk of harm to the City Water Supply and will also result in litigation with Decatur and ADEQ,” the city wrote, asserting later that the communications from the Arkansas Department of Health amounted to concerns that “show the project is marginal on a good day, and at worst presents a potential for environmental disaster for the people of Northwest Arkansas and Northeast Oklahoma.”
Phosphorus flowing from Arkansas poultry growers into Oklahoma’s waters has remained a cause of contention throughout the 21st century — Attorney General Tim Griffin published an op-ed Friday blasting the long-running Illinois River watershed lawsuit in Talk Business and Politics.
“Arkansas will continue to oppose Oklahoma’s attempt to threaten our farmers, weaken our economy, and limit our sovereignty,” Griffin wrote in the op-ed, which was published days after Tyson said it may not enter into contracts with poultry growers in the watershed going forward unless Oklahoma backs off its demands in the long-running lawsuit.
A federal judge ruled in favor of Oklahoma in 2023, but still has not issued a final decision in the case — though he ruled earlier this year that the watershed still remained polluted, fifteen years after it went to trial. Oklahoma’s attorney general said at the time that the final decision could come by the end of 2025.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Misty-Decature-aa-6-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

Transgender health advocates and an attorney in the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia case said the favorable decision is encouraging for the patients and the broader transgender community. But it’s only one battle won against the Trump administration’s campaign to end transgender health care.
And, they warn, the administration’s tactics could be applied to other types of politically-charged areas of health care, such as reproductive care.

“The records the Department of Justice are seeking here are the most sensitive types of medical records,” said Mimi McKenzie, legal director of the Public Interest Law Center in Philadelphia, which represented the families along with lawyers from the firm Ballard Sphar. 
“That coupled with the fact this administration has made no secret of its agenda against transgender youth means that this is a really important win for the families,” McKenzie said.
The Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) sued to quash a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice in June, that purported to seek the information for an investigation of off-label uses of medications such as puberty blockers that are commonly used in medical care for transgender people. 
It was one of more than 20 similar demands made to hospitals across the country, including the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Children’s Hospital (UPMC).
“Medical professionals and organizations that mutilated children in the service of a warped ideology will be held accountable by this Department of Justice,” U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the subpoenas.
But the administration is in a position to keep pushing the issue until it gets a favorable ruling, said Michael Ulrich, associate professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health and School of Law.
“All you need is one district court that says it’s fine, or one circuit court, and you can appeal it all the way up to the Supreme Court,” Ulrich said. “If anything, this administration has shown it believes the higher it goes, the more likely it is to win.”
The DOJ declined a request for comment. CHOP also did not respond to the Capital-Star’s request for comment.
The department has filed an appeal of a September ruling by U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun in Boston, which was the first to block a DOJ subpoena for patient information and medical records from Boston Children’s Hospital’s gender affirming care program. 
It is also appealing a Seattle federal judge’s decision to quash a subpoena issued to QueerDoc, a Washington-based medical clinic that provides gender-affirming health care to adult and adolescent patients.










What this does is entrench from the highest levels that you are different, you are strange, you are not good enough as you are.


– Michael Ulrich, associate professor at Boston University’s School of Public Health and School of Law


U.S. District Judge Mark A. Kearney, who handled the CHOP ruling, referred in his opinion to a fourth subpoena case filed “completely under seal” in which a federal judge ruled against the DOJ.
That means the indirect effects of the administration’s demands on transgender health care could quietly continue to erode access and cause transgender people to hesitate in seeking appropriate care.
“There’s certainly a strategy behind this in terms of providers constantly having to deal with and worry about it, and they eventually say … it’s not worth dealing with anything close to this because of the target it puts on us,” Ulrich said.
It could have dire consequences for the transgender population, Ulrich said, which experiences mental health issues such as suicidal ideal, self harm and substance abuse at significantly higher rates than cisgender people, according to the Williams Institute at the University of California – Los Angeles.
“What this does is entrench from the highest levels that you are different, you are strange, you are not good enough as you are,” Ulrich said, which has the potential to exacerbate mental health problems already fueled by the sense of being ostracized many transgender people experience.
While CHOP did not oppose the DOJ’s request for many of the 15 categories of records the DOJ sought, it told the department it would not compromise the privacy of its patients by providing their confidential health information.
Joined by parents of transgender children treated at the hospital, CHOP argued the DOJ lacked authority to compel the release of the contested records and that the children’s privacy interests outweighed the government’s need for the records. 
Kearney agreed, ruling in favor of the hospital and patients.
In the Nov. 21 decision, Kearney found the DOJ did not show the individual records of gender affirming care patients were relevant to its investigation and therefore lacked authority to demand them. 
Even if the information was relevant to the investigation the DOJ described, “the children’s and their families’ privacy interests in their highly sensitive and confidential medical and psychological treatment in a charged political environment, which considers their medical treatment to [be] a radicalized warped ideology, far outweigh the Department of Justice’s shifting need for the information,” Kearney wrote. 
Fights against the DOJ subpoenas are going on across the country 
In federal court in Pittsburgh, the Public Interest Law Center and Ballard Spahr are also representing four families trying to bar the DOJ’s access to their children’s records held by UPMC. The hospital itself has not challenged the subpoena, but disclosed in a filing last week that it has not disclosed to the government any of the challenged records. 
The families of 10 transgender children in Maryland last month challenged a subpoena issued for Children’s National Hospital. And in California, six families filed a proposed class action lawsuit to quash a demand for minor patients’ records from the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles.
Corinne Goodwin, of the Eastern PA Trans Equity Project, noted the DOJ focus on transgender health care for minors has already reduced access. Penn State Hershey Medical Center and Jefferson Health are among Pennsylvania hospitals that have suspended care for transgender youth.

The Trump administration’s proposed rule that would block Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements for any services provided at hospitals that also provide pediatric gender affirming care would have an even greater chilling effect, Goodwin said. 
Jennifer Levi, senior director of transgender and queer rights at GLAD Law, which provides legal advocacy for the LGBTQ+ community, said the Trump administration’s attack on the transgender community reaches far beyond health care. She cited the elimination of the non-gender sex marker “X” in U.S. passports, as one example of the broader onslaught against trans-rights. 
As a result, families who are caught in the middle of the medical records fight are also unable to obtain or update passports to travel to continue their care abroad.
Levi said the mounting attacks and growing uncertainty make this “a really scary time and vulnerable time for parents with adolescent transgender children.”
“This is a moment when these kinds of attacks by the administration cause so many problems for families, for young adults,” she said. “And that’s why it’s so important for the courts to step up in their traditional roles to protect this community.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1323919275-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

Rage bait — manipulative tactics used to drive engagement online — is the Oxford University Press word of the year for 2025. If you spend any time at all online, particularly on social media, you do not need an Oxford dictionary to confirm how constant and pernicious the rage and rage baiting are.
We are entering primary election season here in Kentucky, and we have already been talking with our friends and neighbors about the hateful, hard to stomach ads to replace Mitch McConnell in the U.S. Senate. 
In one of his ads, Senate candidate Rep. Andy Barr says, “The woke left wants to neuter America, literally.” What in the world does that mean? He then shows a clip of black people standing in a circle, burning a flag, and then photos of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Chuck Schumer, fists raised, looking angry, with Barr’s voiceover, “They hate our values, they hate our history, and goodness knows they hate President Trump.” 
So much hate, and that’s just the first 20 seconds. 
A political action committee (PAC) backing Barr has released an ad which calls Nate Morris, one of Barr’s opponents in the Senate race, “Fake Nate Morris: fully woke and full of sh—.”
Do these ads inform the public about policies that will create jobs, lower grocery prices, build affordable housing or ensure that American families are not bankrupted by medical debt? 
No, because talking about these issues does not spark enough interest or outrage for politicians to get our attention in a fractured media landscape of 30-second soundbites. 
On her Dec. 4 podcast, Jessica Tarlov, one of the cohosts of Fox News’ The Five, discusses (at the 48 minute mark) how politicians cannot break through in today’s media landscape without fomenting rage online which, in turn, goes viral and keeps their names in our distracted, short-attention-span minds until election day. 
Rage baiting, Tarlov says, is “an apt word of the year.” 
Social media algorithms are the third rail running through and ruining our political discourse and relationships, and yet we have grown so accustomed to online rage that we are often numb to it. “Folks with the big platforms are the ones that are driving American society,” Tarlov says, “They’re getting hired into the biggest jobs you can have, from the secretary of war to the heads of these media companies. Everyone needs content creators and influencers, whatever you want to call them, on the landing page of their organization … and it’s a vicious cycle that keeps feeding it.”
The morning after the Nov. 3 Lawrenceburg City Council meeting, I watched the video go viral and the outraged commentary that accompanied it. At first, when I spotted a Facebook post that I knew was not wholly accurate, I commented with missing context, writing that I’d been there and witnessed the entire meeting. 
Nobody cared. Within minutes I deleted my comments, as adding facts only sparked more rage.
Rage baiting is Oxford dictionary’s word of the year for a reason. 
Online rage, cruelty, bullying, trolling and the ability to post misleading information or even outright lies are destroying our relationships and communities.
Meanwhile, tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg — who built these social media companies, created the algorithms that fuel our rage and help fund the PACs responsible for some of the most heinous political ads — are smiling all the way to their big, fat banks.
The question is:  What are we — and the leaders we send to Congress — doing to stop it?",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/IMG_2078.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

(Photo courtesy of Knox County Schools/YouTube)When the U.S. Supreme Court deadlocked this year in a case over whether charter schools can be religious, experts said it wouldn’t take long for the question to re-emerge in another lawsuit.
They were right.
In Tennessee, the nonprofit Wilberforce Academy is suing the Knox County Schools in federal court because the district refuses to allow a Christian charter school. Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti is on the school’s side. He issued an opinion last month that the state’s ban on religious charter schools likely violates the First Amendment.
“Tennessee’s public charter schools are not government entities for constitutional purposes and may assert free exercise rights,” he wrote to Rep. Michele Carringer, the Knoxville Republican who requested the opinion.
The legal challenge in Tennessee comes as a Florida-based charter school network prepares to submit an application to the Oklahoma Charter School Board for a Jewish virtual charter high school. Peter Deutsch, the former Democratic congressman who founded the Ben Gamla charter schools, began working on the idea long before the case over St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School even went to court. The U.S. Supreme Court decision means that an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision blocking the school from receiving state funds still stands.

“The prior decision shows that there’s an open question here that needs to be resolved,” said Eric Baxter, vice president and senior counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, a law firm representing the National Ben Gamla Jewish Charter School Foundation. “We hope the court will get it right this time. We hope the federal courts get it right without having to go to the Supreme Court.”
Idaho also confronted the issue earlier this year. The state’s first charter, Brabeion Academy, initially promoted the school as Christian. But it was approved in August as a nonreligious school and will open as such next fall.

‘A Day to Exhale’: Supreme Court Deadlocks on Religious Charter Schools — For Now

 




Deutsch, Skrmetti and other supporters of faith-based charter schools base their argument on three earlier Supreme Court rulings allowing public funds to support sectarian schools. They say that excluding religious organizations from operating faith-based charter schools is discrimination and violates the Constitution. But leaders of the charter sector and public school advocates argue that classifying charter schools as private would threaten funding and civil rights protections for 3.7 million students nationwide.
“Unless and until the U.S. Supreme Court takes up a future case and rules otherwise, we advise all charter school associations and public charter schools to adhere to the letter and spirit of the law in their respective states,” Starlee Coleman, president and CEO of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, said in a statement.
‘Not on our watch’

When the Supreme Court considered St. Isidore, Deutsch, was prepared to advocate for Jewish congregations to open schools that not only teach their language, but also their faith. He called the case “a historic opportunity” to bring Jewish education to thousands of children.
To Oklahoma Attorney General Genter Drummond, the debate is settled, for now. In November, he said his office would “oppose any attempts to undermine the rule of law.”
Americans United, which advocates for maintaining church-state separation, has also issued a warning over the new school. The organization represented parents and advocates in a separate case over the school.
“Religious extremists once again are trying to undermine our country’s promise of church-state separation by forcing Oklahoma taxpayers to fund a religious public school. Not on our watch,” Rachel Laser, president and CEO, said in a press release.

The legal fight over religious charter schools began in 2023, when the Oklahoma Virtual Charter School Board voted 3-2 to approve a charter for St. Isidore, setting off a closely watched case that spanned two years. At the time, the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, a nonreligious group, called the charter board’s decision unconstitutional. Rachel Johnson, the group’s executive director, didn’t return calls or emails requesting a comment on Ben Gamla’s proposal.
None of the members who originally voted on St. Isidore serves on the state’s new Oklahoma Charter School Board. But for one person involved with Ben Gamla’s application, this is familiar territory. Brett Farley is on the proposed school’s board, according to a letter of intent the foundation submitted to the charter board in November.
Farley once held a top position with the Oklahoma GOP and is also executive director of the Catholic Conference of Oklahoma, which focuses on public policy issues involving the church. While preparing the St. Isidore application, Farley connected with Notre Dame law Professor Nicole Stelle Garnett, whose scholarly work formed the basis of the legal argument for the school.
Garnett’s position is that nonprofits running charter schools are like private contractors, and as with other publicly funded programs, can’t be excluded just because they are religious. She’s also close friends with Justice Amy Coney Barrett, who recused herself from the St. Isidore case. Experts speculated that Chief Justice John Roberts sided with the three liberals on the court, resulting in the 4-4 tie.

‘Passion for religious freedom’
The virtual school, the intent letter says, would initially enroll about 40 students, focusing on “college readiness, while developing deep Jewish knowledge, faith and values within a supportive learning community.”
But some are surprised Deutsch isn’t making his bid for a Jewish charter school in Florida, where his existing, non-religious charter schools have thrived.
“I think Florida could be a good option given the new attorney general’s passion for religious freedom,” said Daniel Aqua, the director of special projects at Teach Coalition, a nonprofit that advocates for Jewish education.

After Contentious Vote, Hebrew Charter Founder Eyes Jewish School in Oklahoma

 




The demand for a Jewish charter school would be much higher in Florida, which has an estimated Jewish population of nearly 762,000, compared with about 9,000 in Oklahoma.
Charter founders in Florida submit their applications to local school districts first. The state recently added colleges as authorizers, but Oklahoma, where organizers can file applications directly with the state charter board, offers a more streamlined process.
‘Public Christian school’
But efforts to create publicly-funded religious schools are not limited to the charter sector. A new school in Colorado, Riverstone Academy, calls itself the state’s “first public Christian school.” Now serving 30 students in Pueblo, south of Colorado Springs, Riverstone is what is sometimes referred to as a “contract” school because districts sign agreements with private organizations to provide education services. In this case, Education reEnvisioned, one of the state’s 21 boards of cooperative educational services, or BOCES, authorized the school.
In October, the Colorado Department of Education warned Ken Witt, the BOCES’ executive director, that the school’s per-student funding is at risk because it is “not operating in a nonsectarian nature.” The letter also went to District 49, near Colorado Springs, one of Education reEnvisioned’s member districts.
In a response, Witt wrote that he was “alarmed at the threat” that the school might not receive funding. “We did not and legally cannot discriminate against this school on account of its religious affiliation,” he wrote. Examining Riverstone’s curriculum to determine if the school is truly sectarian, he said, would be “unconstitutionally entangling and discriminatory against different forms of religion.”
Witt told The 74 that funding usually doesn’t flow from the state to a new school until January, so it’s too soon to know whether officials will withhold funds.

‘Keep coming back’
“You’re going to see those within the charter sector and outside of it basically taking the same approach” — arguing that private groups delivering religious instruction can’t be denied public funds, said Preston Green, an education professor at the University of Connecticut.
To Green, Riverstone’s identity as a “contract” school calls to mind a 1982 case, one that Garnett and other proponents of religious charter schools often highlight when they say that charters are not “state actors.” In Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, the Supreme Court said a Massachusetts private school that received public funds for educating teens with behavior problems did not act under the “color of state law” when it fired six employees.
The question, experts say, is not if, but when the Supreme Court will eventually see another case about religious public schools Justice Barrett won’t have the same reason to recuse herself, Green said, and he’s not convinced that Roberts would side with the liberals a second time.
The advocates, he said, “keep coming back at this because they think that they’ll get the votes.”

(Photo Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)As George Mason University Rector Charles Stimson addressed his colleagues Thursday, he sat across from faculty members, students and campus workers holding signs plastered with images of his face, gathered in opposition to his decision to hold a second executive committee meeting with only six voting members.
Tensions have boiled over within the Northern Virginia university’s community over Stimson’s decision to meet and vote on university matters without the required quorum. Outside of GMU’s meeting on Thursday, protestors yelled “no quorum, no business,” and organizers accused the board of meeting improperly.
One of the organizing groups, the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, said in a statement that Stimson is flouting rules to push his “ideological agenda,” and claimed the board is considering a settlement by the Department of Justice to drop the four investigations against the institution similar to the University of Virginia.
UVA interim president to senators: Agreement with DOJ to pause probes was ‘best option available’

University officials told the Mercury that it has no proposed settlement agreement.
Stimson, who stated that the board is simply “following the law,” mentioned in an interview after the meeting that in the absence of a quorum, legislative actions by state lawmakers have supported the executive committee’s role in meeting and addressing the institution’s business.
“Our bylaws incorporated (those legislative actions) decades ago … because you can’t run a university from a board perspective if you don’t have an executive committee or some component of the board, and so we’re just doing what the law authorized,” said Stimson.
Stimson pointed to several policies to support the executive committee’s meetings, including Virginia Code 23.1-1502, the university’s bylaws, and the 1919 statute enacted by the General Assembly that codified the executive committee’s authority, which he says has been rooted in the traditions of university governance.
The rector said the practice of allowing the university’s executive committee to conduct regular business in the absence of a quorum has been in place since the early 1800s. The only body that can repeal rules, Stimson said, is the General Assembly.
“No high-functioning organization defenestrates an executive committee from doing the regular business of a university, which is what we were doing,” Stimson said.
Senate Majority Leader Scott Surovell, D-Fairfax, said he spoke with Stimson in October before the first executive committee, telling the Mercury that Senate Democrats disagree with the rector’s view and question if the decision runs afoul with the preliminary junction set in July to suspend governor appointments from serving on the governing board.
On Thursday, GMU’s executive committee approved several actions including the university’s six-year operating plan, which needed to be voted on by December to follow state statute. The committee opted to establish two new degree programs, an MS in quantum science and engineering and a PhD in cybersecurity, and to rename the College of Public Health’s Department of Health Administration to the Department of Health Administration, Policy, and Informatics. 
Members also voted on the conferral of emeritus/emerita status, and the election of new tenured faculty. Meanwhile, the board is waiting for all 10 vacant seats to be filled through a court order or legislative action.
“We have to promote faculty members, we have to give people tenure,” Stimson said. “When we hire people, we hire them in their contract with the express understanding that they’ll get tenure, and the only people that can give them tenure is the board. … None of us on this board are going to refuse to conduct our fiduciary duties and honor our obligations to the university.”
 The future

In Charlottesville, critics said the University of Virginia’s Board of Visitors has also recently convened short of the necessary number of representatives who are Virginia residents and alumni. Last Friday, campus workers and faculty members rallied in protest of the action as well as the institution continuing its search for the next president without a full board in place.
Gov.-elect Abigail Spanberger recently told the Richmond Times-Dispatch that on her first day, she would fill the vacancies on three university governing boards at George Mason, UVA and the Virginia Military Institute. 
Simultaneously, eight gubernatorial appointments await a court’s decision on their future. The Senate Committee on Elections and Privileges rejected 22 appointees of Gov. Glenn Youngkin this year. 
Since the Virginia Supreme Court refused to take up the case involving Youngkin’s appointees, a status hearing has been scheduled for Dec. 8 at 9 a.m. in the Fairfax County Circuit Court.

The nonalcoholic beverage option has been growing nationwide as an alternative for people who are looking to cut back or cut out alcohol altogether. A recent Gallup poll showed the percentage of Americans drinking alcohol has fallen to 54%.  
Analysts and farmers say the hemp-based THC industry, however, could come to an abrupt halt by November of next year as Congress voted to ban most hemp-derived THC products in a last-minute addition to a government spending bill that ended the most recent government shutdown.
Joint Commission unveils changes to cannabis bill, setting stage for 2026 retail launch

The THC seltzers and other hemp-based products are a “big and growing segment of the economy,” Bingo Beer co-owner Jay Bayer told the Mercury earlier this year. 
“I don’t think the solution is to put the genie back in the bottle,” Bayer said in a recent call.  He added that offering THC products has been a “lifeline” for some in the alcoholic beverage industry to stay afloat while meeting consumers’ needs. 
But as Virginia continues to explore a legal cannabis market, Bayer is eyeing possible ways to  pivot. 
“If we were to switch over to THC from marijuana, consumers would come over with us,” he said. 
 Uncertain future

Hemp businesses nationwide are trying to map their next steps. In North Carolina, for example, hemp businesses are bracing for potential legal battles to defend their industry, like other states where cannabis isn’t legal.
“We can’t really pivot,” Dana Burham, co-owner of Otherside Hemp, told NC Newsline last month. 
But Virginia is in a “privileged” space, Pure Shenandoah co-owner Tanner Johnson said in a recent call. He runs the company with several of his siblings as their products run the gamut of industrial hemp uses, from a “hempcrete” study contract with the U.S. Air Force they were awarded in 2023, to being the supplier for Bingo Beer’s THC seltzers. 
While Congress laid the groundwork for businesses in the industry in 2018, Johnson likened the hemp-limited provision in the government spending bill as “pulling the rug” from under people. But companies like his own with diversified portfolios and Virginia businesses could have an easier time pivoting than those in states with no existing or forthcoming legal cannabis market. Still, he said, he’s keeping an eye on things nationally. 
As a representative of  the Virginia Cannabis Association, he will also lend insights and ideas to lawmakers as they craft and pass the legislation to enable the new market. 
“It’s a bad situation for a lot of hemp growers and processors and retailers,” Johnson said. “But in Virginia, we kind of feel like we’re almost threading a needle, where this industry is coming to a close right as another industry opens.”

Yates for the Virginia Mercury)In Southwest Virginia, two proposed pipeline projects would lengthen two existing pipelines and add additional compressor stations to help pump more gas through the commonwealth into North Carolina. Residents’ concerns over past violations and an expedited permitting process prompted Virginia Democratic U.S. Reps. Jennifer McClellan and Bobby Scott to demand federal regulators perform a more thorough review last week.
In a letter penned by the two members and North Carolina U.S. Rep. Valerie Foushee, the lawmakers urged the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to scrutinize the potential environmental impacts of the two projects.
“On behalf of communities in Virginia and North Carolina, we urge the Commission to prepare an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) for both projects before considering them further. If FERC is unwilling to do so, we urge the Commission to deny the certification of both projects to ensure that the surrounding communities are not placed at undue risk,” the letter read.
The Mountain Valley Pipeline Southgate project would add 31 miles of pipeline from Pittsylvania County across the border to North Carolina. Concurrently, the Williams Company wants to expand the Transco pipeline by an additional 55 miles – 26 of which would be run adjacent to the pipeline in Southwest Virginia and create additional compressor stations in Pittsylvania County.
FERC did not require a new Environmental Impact Statement to be done for the new projects, which is a deeper examination of how the project may impact wetlands, pollute waterways and other possible environmental concerns. 
For the two separate expansion projects, FERC accepted the previous reports and said no risks to human health or the environment were expected with the expansions. The members of Congress took issue with that assessment and said the agency was straying from precedence of review for projects of this size.
“This massive project will have significant environmental impacts that demand a thorough review and a complete EIS,” the letter read. “Further, not conducting an EIS for SSEP would be a dramatic departure from past FERC policy and practice for projects of this magnitude. The Commission has consistently completed EISs for projects much smaller in size than SSEP.”
The members pointed to 375 alleged violations former Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring’s office in 2018 said MVP committed, including unpermitted discharges into waterways, failure to maintain erosion, and other water related issues. The company ultimately settled the issue by paying a $2.5 million civil fine. 
The letter also details local pushback to the two projects because they are so close to each other and raises residents’ concerns about the potential impact of two major pipelines nearby.
“The colocation of two high-pressure, large diameter pipelines is of significant concern for local residents. Multiple local governments and other elected officials have expressed concerns about the safety and health impacts of these proposed pipelines,” the letter said.
Twelve Democratic members of the General Assembly sent a letter to the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality and FERC asking the agencies to deny permits for the two expansion projects until cumulative impact research can be done for the area.
“We are specifically concerned about the co-location of two high-pressure pipelines on nearly identical routes through Pittsylvania County and the undue burden that would place on waterbodies crossed repeatedly by both projects, including the Banister River, Sandy River and tributaries of the Dan River,” the legislator’s letter said.
The federal permits for the two projects are expected to be issued or denied in the next few months. DEQ is also in the process of reviewing the state permits for both pipelines.

For […[...]","Red Onion State Prison in Wise County (Photo courtesy of Virginia Department of Corrections.) Over the past two years, the Virginia General Assembly approved legislation to limit the use of solitary confinement across prisons in the commonwealth. 
Legislation to this effect was passed in 2023, which was signed into law by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. Critics, however, argue that this new law lacks adequate enforcement mechanisms and protective limits. For this reason, the General Assembly passed follow-up legislation in 2024 with stronger language, which was subsequently vetoed.
The fact that the General Assembly passed legislation two years in a row to end the widespread use of solitary confinement indicates broad public support for the goal. The legislation, however, does not address the isolation of inmates in regional and city jails. As a research team of two students and a professor, we set out to determine how many people in local jails across Virginia are being held in conditions similar to solitary confinement.
Most sheriffs and jail superintendents will insist they do not use solitary confinement. We learned instead to substitute the phrase “administrative segregation,” which in most cases means the same thing: an inmate held for 20-24 hours a day in a cell about the size of a parking space, typically behind a heavy steel door with a tiny window and narrow slot that just fits a food tray. On a positive note, one jail administrator informed us that most of the administrative segregation at his facility instead has barred doors that easily allow for communication across cells, but we suspect this is the exception, rather than the rule.
Because data about the number of people held in administrative segregation is not publicly available, we sent information requests to 35 regional and city jails across Virginia asking for a “snapshot,” which would help us do a point-in-time count of the number of people held in solitary-like conditions at a local level. 
We only heard back from 11 jails, which makes our goal of producing a total population estimate unreachable. But we still learned something important: the use of isolated confinement is highly variable between jails. 
One city jail reported to us that it holds 69 out of a total 238 inmates (almost one in three persons detained in the facility) in administrative segregation behind heavy steel doors. Two jails housed more than one out of ten inmates in isolation. Others held between 4-7% of their population in solitary-like conditions. 
Importantly, three jails kept less than 3% of their inmates in administrative segregation. One regional jail in Central Virginia reported that only 1% of total inmates are held in isolation.
This variability indicates that some regional jails may be over-relying on solitary confinement to run their institutions. But, in order to encourage jails to share this information with us, we told them we would not name specific institutions in our reporting.
There is a robust literature in the social sciences on the harms associated with solitary confinement for periods longer than 14 days. We humans are innately social, maintaining our sense of self and frameworks for cognition in dialogue with others. 
Research shows that prolonged isolation can cause mental anguish and long-term psychological harm. Even short-term exposure to isolated confinement can result in a higher likelihood to reoffend and decreased rates of employment after release.
Several sheriffs and jail superintendents told us that administrative segregation is a necessary safety and disciplinary tool. Without it, they said, our local and regional jails would be more dangerous places for both inmates and jail staff. 
We are not experts in incarceration, and we do not dispute this point. But we also believe that, without protective laws and public oversight, there is the potential that administrative segregation could be used more than necessary, and that it would be a good goal for our society to use it as infrequently as possible.
Afterall, our preliminary research indicates at least a few jails in Virginia operate with minimal use of administrative segregation. This, to us, is very hopeful. Perhaps these jails could be models for other institutions across the state working to reduce the number of inmates held in isolation. 
At a minimum, we think all jails in Virginia should regularly report to the public on the number of persons held in administrative segregation. These institutions are funded by taxpayers, and taxpayers have a right to know about the conditions in which they operate, especially as they rely — even if out of necessity —  on methods of incarceration known to cause suffering and psychological harm.
We also hope the General Assembly will one day address the use of isolated confinement in city and regional jails. Currently, state code provides very minimal protections for inmates held in these local facilities.
For instance, inmates only have a right to a minimum of one hour out of their cell for recreation a week and for two weekly showers. These are only minimum standards. Local jails likely do much better, governed by their own rules and procedures. But operating standards for city and regional jails are typically not made public so we don’t know what, for instance, local policies are on the use of administrative segregation.
Sunlight, Supreme Court Justice William Brandies said, is the best disinfectant. With more sun shining into local and regional jails, we might bring more inmates out of the shadows of isolated confinement.

(Getty photo)Rhode Island’s primary care system is stressed, and the state struggles to recruit and retain new primary care physicians. To address the ongoing primary care shortage, a special legislative commission is exploring the feasibility of creating a new public medical school at the University of Rhode Island. Its report recommended that URI should develop a ‘community-based’ medical school with an emphasis on training primary care physicians. The new medical school would cost taxpayers $22.5 million annually after an initial public investment of $20 million in initial start-up funds, for a total of $245 million over the next decade. A new public medical school, however, is the wrong prescription to address the state’s ongoing shortage of primary care clinicians. Instead, policymakers need to enact broader and more comprehensive reforms to attract and retain clinicians in Rhode Island.
The closure of Anchor Medical highlights the need for fundamental reforms to improve the state’s ability to attract physicians. As Dr. Alexandra Tien has noted, the closure is the result of unsuccessful recruitment of new physicians to replace those who are retiring. This begs the question: Why is it so difficult to recruit and retain primary care physicians in Rhode Island? Wallet Hub ranked Rhode Island as the second-worst state in the nation for doctors to practice, citing low average annual wages (48th in the nation) and high malpractice award payments per capita (tied for first).
Physicians in Rhode Island earn less than their peers in Connecticut and Massachusetts. The General Assembly recently boosted primary care reimbursement for Medicaid by $40 million (including $15 million in state funding) but the NBC 10 I-Team found that commercial insurance reimbursement rates are 29% higher in nearby Massachusetts communities. The governor and General Assembly also asked the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner to undertake a review of primary care reimbursement in 2026. Both are important steps toward improving the practice environment in Rhode Island.
The number of primary care residency openings in Rhode Island also shapes whether physicians will stay to practice in Rhode Island after completing their medical training. Upon graduating from medical school, newly minted MDs must complete a residency (and often a fellowship) before entering practice. Rather than increasing the number of medical school graduates, the U.S. needs to address a longstanding bottleneck in the number of residency positions. Between 2011 and 2017, fewer than half of the primary care doctors who completed their family medicine residency programs in Rhode Island remained in the state to practice, which underscores the difficulty of retaining physicians in the state.
The timing of the proposed medical school also occurs in a challenging fiscal environment. As the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council noted, the Ocean State faces a growing structural budget deficit over the coming decade. Deficits are expected to increase from $304.3 million in fiscal year  2027 to more than $462.1 million by fiscal year 2030. In this context, opening a new publicly funded medical school at a cost of nearly $250 million will exacerbate an already difficult budgetary forecast.










Between 2011 and 2017, fewer than half of the primary care doctors who completed their family medicine residency programs in Rhode Island remained in the state to practice, which underscores the difficulty of retaining physicians in the state.


A recent report by the Milbank Memorial Fund and the Physicians’ Foundation noted that over time, fewer physicians are choosing careers in primary care. At the same time, roughly one in four Medicare patient visits were delivered by nurse practitioners or physician assistants. It’s time for policymakers to rethink the debate about primary care in Rhode Island. Instead of a narrow focus on the shortage of primary care physicians, we must seek to recruit, train, and retain enough primary care clinicians to live and work in Rhode Island.
Rather than investing $22.5 million per year in a new medical school, the state could provide additional scholarships and support for students attending existing nurse practitioner programs at Rhode Island College, Salve Regina University, and URI. Indeed, investing in nurse practitioners (NPs) offers a cost-effective approach to addressing the primary care shortfall in Rhode Island. 
It would take nine years before a new public medical school at the University of Rhode Island graduates its first cohort of students. Rhode Island simply can’t wait that long. Instead, the state should build upon recent initiatives to improve reimbursement for primary care clinicians and strengthen existing programs to train more nurse practitioners.

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)As New Hampshire’s education freedom account program swells past 10,000 student participants, legislative oversight has faltered.
A committee meant to monitor the EFA program’s performance has not met publicly in more than a year, records show, and it has failed to produce its required annual report by its Nov. 30 deadline.
The Education Freedom Savings Account Oversight Committee once met multiple times per year. But according to its public page, the last time it convened was Nov. 25, 2024, shortly before finalizing its 2024 report. 
In a statement Thursday, Sen. Ruth Ward, a Stoddard Republican and the chairwoman of the committee, said the five-person committee had attempted to meet this year but failed to find a time for all members to convene — particularly those from the House. 
“Since the end of the legislative session, we have made several attempts to schedule a meeting,” Ward said. “However, the House asked representatives to avoid travel during July and August, limiting available dates and now with the resignation of Representative (Glenn) Cordelli, we are waiting for a House replacement. 
“These factors have kept us from achieving a quorum and convening the committee,” she added, referring to the statutory requirement that the committee have three out of five members present in order to meet.
After receiving questions Thursday, Ward sent an email Friday calling on the committee to hold an organizational meeting Dec. 15, according to Rep. Peggy Balboni, a Rye Democrat and member of the committee.
But Democrats have criticized the lack of meetings and argue it highlights the need for more transparency. 
The education freedom account program allows families to access state education funds to use toward private and home-school expenses; families this year will receive an average of $4,911 per year.
In June, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed legislation that removed the income limits for the program — previously set at 350% of the federal poverty level, or $112,525 for a family of four — but set a 10,000-student cap for its first year. Due to a series of exemptions to the cap, the program began the 2025-26 school year with 10,510 students, according to the Department of Education, nearly doubling last year’s 5,765.
Republicans, who created the program in 2021 as a mechanism to support school choice, say the increase demonstrates demand. They have argued the nonprofit organization that runs the program, the Children’s Scholarship Fund, already receives sufficient oversight from the Department of Education. 
But Democrats, who oppose the program and say the funding should go to public schools, counter the jump in participation calls for more scrutiny of who is receiving EFAs and how they are spent. 
The oversight committee is supposed to help do that, Democrats say. 
Warring reports
Created by statute, the committee consists of two members of the Senate and three members of the House, and is meant to “monitor the implementation of” the program, “including the impact of state education funding to local district schools.” It is also supposed to produce an annual report by Nov. 30 that makes any legislative recommendations.
From the beginning, the process has been fractured. Democratic and Republican committee members, disagreeing over the very existence of the program, put forward widely different concepts of acceptable practices.
In 2024, for instance, the committee produced a majority report written by Republicans and a minority report by Democrats. The Republican report gave a positive portrait. “In just four years, the Education Freedom Account program has proven itself both popular and successful,” it stated, calling it “one of the fastest start-up school choice programs in the nation.”
The majority report found that the EFA program had not reduced state funding to public schools, and pointed to legislation that has increased the per-pupil amount of state funding given to public schools despite declining enrollments. “Even as the Education Freedom Account program has grown to serve more than 5,000 New Hampshire families, per-pupil state aid to local school districts has increased by nearly 20%,” the report stated, referring to the period between 2020 and 2024. 
The Republican report concluded there was no need to amend the EFA law, nor to extend the end date “phase out” grants that pay school districts gradually smaller amounts for any of their students who leave to receive an EFA.
The Democrats’ 2024 minority report produced different conclusions. It stated that much of the EFA money is going to families that had already decided not to participate in the public school system and pursue private and home-school programs. “Those families were costing the state zero dollars and now they are being given unaudited dollars,” the minority report read. The report also argued that the process by which the Children’s Scholarship Fund selects eligible vendors that may receive the EFA funds was opaque. 
The 2024 minority report said there were “substantial” funds being diverted from the state’s Education Trust Fund that could be used to boost state support for public schools, which the state Supreme Court ruled this year is unconstitutionally low. And it concluded that the EFA law should be changed by putting the Department of Education in charge of running the program instead of the private scholarship fund; capping the program to a budgeted amount; widening state audits to survey 20% of accounts; decoupling the EFA grant amounts from the state adequacy formula, which regulates how much is sent to public schools; requiring EFA recipients to end any discriminatory admissions policies, and more. 
Before issuing the separate reports, the oversight committee had met about once a month from August to November 2024. After that, the committee stopped meeting.
Scheduling problems
In her statement explaining the lack of meetings this year, Ward pointed to an announcement by House Speaker Sherman Packard in the House calendar in spring that “in keeping with past practice to minimize travel costs, there will be no legislative activity or mileage reimbursement between July and August.” 
She also noted the resignation of Cordelli, a member of the oversight committee and a key architect of the EFA program. But Cordelli resigned in early November, meaning he could have participated in September and October. 
The committee page indicates that an organizational meeting was scheduled for Oct. 21, but was canceled. 
Ward said the committee had struggled to meet quorum, which according to the statute, requires three out of five members to be present. Sen. Suzanne Prentiss, a Lebanon Democrat and member of the committee, has questioned that reasoning, arguing the committee has met before when some lawmakers couldn’t attend. 
“I don’t know what’s behind not meeting, but it’s not the membership thing,” she said. 
Meanwhile, the status of the 2025 oversight report, which was due Nov. 30, is unclear. In her statement Thursday, Ward said “work is underway on the 2025 EFA Annual Report.”
Kate Baker Demers, the executive director of the Children’s Scholarship Fund, said in an interview that she had received an email from Senate Deputy Chief of Staff Grant Bosse in November asking for statistics on the demographics of who is using EFAs in the 2025-26 school year. The Department of Education released those figures Nov. 14. 
That email indicated to Baker Demers that the committee was intending to produce the 2025 report despite the lack of meetings, she said.  
But Democrats say if work is happening, they have not been included. Prentiss said there has been no committee-wide discussion about any work on the 2025 report.
A spokeswoman for Ward did not respond to a question about whether the EFA report was being prepared without the committee meeting.
Transparency debates
Democrats’ frustration with the oversight committee comes amid a bigger battle over transparency of the program. Democrats argue there should be more public information issued around who is signing up for EFAs and how families are spending the money. 
Currently, the public can review annual reports by the Department of Education that show how many students in each town are receiving EFAs; how much those students are receiving; how many students overall have transferred into EFAs from public schools; how many EFA recipients have been approved for additional aid because they are lower-income, are English language learners, or require special education services; the racial and gender breakdown of EFA recipients; the number of EFA recipients in each grade level; and how all those metrics compare to the public school student population. 
The Children’s Scholarship Fund submits an annual 990 form to the Internal Revenue Service as a nonprofit organization, which details top-level receipts and expenditures. The organization also commissions an annual audit of its receipts and expenditures by Grant Thornton, a New York-based accounting firm, and publishes the results; the latest 2025 audit will be published Monday, Baker Demers said.
The EFA program receives a semi-regular audit from the state Department of Education. In 2023, the department’s EFA administrator conducted a “compliance monitoring review” of 50 randomized EFA accounts, using tax return information to determine whether they had actually been eligible for the program. That review, released in 2024, flagged problems with 12 of the 50 recipients, and resulted in the Children’s Scholarship Fund returning EFA funding for two students and addressing other recommendations.
Baker Demers said that in recent months, the department has begun a second compliance monitoring review of EFAs using the same randomized process; a spokeswoman for the department declined to confirm that.
Meanwhile, the Legislative Budget Assistant, or LBA, a nonpartisan arm of the legislative branch that conducts audits on state agencies, is reviewing the Department of Education’s oversight of the EFA law; that final audit report is expected by summer 2026, LBA staff say. 
Baker Demers says the combination of those reviews indicates that the EFA program is already subject to a lot of scrutiny.
“I don’t mind it,” she said. “It’s good – great to do audits. But it’s like a perpetual audit.” 
But Democrats say there are still many areas where they would like more information. 
They note that LBA auditors were blocked by statute from reviewing the Children’s Scholarship Fund actions directly, meaning the LBA audit will focus only on the Department of Education’s oversight of the program, and not on the approval process of EFA applicants and vendors conducted by the scholarship fund.
And they have also pointed to a decision by Baker Demers this summer to remove reports detailing how much EFA money was sent to each vendor, a move first reported by the Concord Monitor. Baker Demers told the Monitor she had done so due to the potential for harassment of smaller vendors by people opposed to the EFA program. 
On Thursday, she said the Children’s Scholarship Fund would re-upload the expenditure reports for the 2021-22 and 2022-23 school years — as well as the unreleased reports for the 2023-24 and 2024-25 school years — by the end of December. Those reports would redact spending data for EFA vendors serving fewer than 10 students, Baker Demers said, citing privacy and harassment concerns.
To Balboni, those measures still fall short of the accountability she feels the EFA program deserves. Next year, she is introducing two bills intended to address that. One would require the legislative oversight committee to conduct a “review of student data, eligibility requirements, and EFA expenditures.” The other would require the Department of Education to obtain full access to EFA recipient data and to conduct more extensive audits. 
“It’s just trying to get to the heart of where this money is going,” Balboni said in an interview. 
To Ward, there is already plenty of information to review. “The process continues to be transparent: reports from the Children’s Scholarship Fund, EFA meeting minutes, and annual reports are publicly accessible,” she said in her statement.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/PB122675-EFA-oversight-committee-1024x694.jpg,,,2025-12-08 05:57:09.289201

Clarke, an ICU nurse in Asheville, North Carolina, wants to get her master’s degree to become a nurse practitioner or a certified registered nurse anesthetist — occupations in high demand — and eventually work toward a doctoral degree.
But new borrowing limits on federal student loans may hinder her from reaching that goal.
A provision in the federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, the tax and spending law enacted this summer, overhauls the federal student loan program for graduate students in an effort to simplify the loan process and discourage colleges from raising tuition.
To comply with the new law, the U.S. Department of Education recently issued a draft rule that would impose limits on how much graduate students can borrow — up to $20,500 per year and $100,000 in total for most students, but up to $50,000 a year and $200,000 in total for students in a new “professional” category. The category includes people studying to be medical doctors, dentists, veterinarians, pharmacists and lawyers.
Students pursuing advanced nursing degrees, however, are not included in the professional category.
Advanced practice nurses, hospital associations and other health groups say the rule will make it unaffordable for many nurses to advance their careers — disproportionately affecting communities, especially rural ones, that rely on them amid physician shortages.
Advanced nurses can provide primary care, deliver babies as nurse midwives and anesthetize surgery patients where there aren’t enough physicians to go around. They can also write some prescriptions. Advanced practice nurses also serve as college faculty in community colleges and nursing schools.
Student loan caps might worsen the national doctor shortage, critics worry

The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates the nation will employ an additional 134,000 nurse practitioners, nurse midwives and nurse anesthetists in the next decade, 35% more than there are now. In high demand, nurse practitioners are one of the fastest-growing occupations in the nation, the bureau says.
“We depend heavily on nurse practitioners,” said Sandy Reding, a president of the California Nurses Association and vice president of National Nurses United. “But if they don’t have access to getting further education, we’re not going to see additional nurse practitioners come into the field.”
Tuition, combined with living expenses, can far exceed $50,000 a year for many post-bachelor’s nursing programs.
“Potentially, this could devastate a whole generation of nurses getting their advanced practice degrees,” Clarke said.
Some education advocates fear that losing a pipeline of advanced nursing practitioners to serve as college faculty also could lead to fewer registered and advanced nurses and other caregivers with two- and four-year degrees, because there would be fewer people to teach them.










It’s a slap in the face to the nurses that go to work every day doing our very best to care for our patients. 


– Sandy Reding, a president of the California Nurses Association


Many advanced-degree nursing faculty are retiring. Nursing schools reported more than 2,100 full-time faculty vacancies in 2022, according to the American Nurses Association — leading to roughly 80,000 students being turned away.
States are already grappling with workforce shortfalls caused by exhausting work conditions that have led many nurses to burn out and leave the field, or leave bedside care to teach, nurses told Stateline.
In response to an uproar from nursing associations and others in health care, the Department of Education released a rebuttal last week defending its proposal, saying it is not a “value judgement about the importance of programs.”
It also said it may make changes in response to public comments. The new limits would take effect July 1, 2026.
Rural and underserved communities
Advanced practice registered nurses, known as APRNs, fill gaps in rural communities where there aren’t enough clinicians. For example, nurses needed for surgeries — nurse anesthetists, or CRNAs — make up 80% of anesthesia providers in rural counties. About a fifth of APRNs nationwide worked in rural areas in 2022, according to one survey of more than 18,800 APRNs.
“The nurse practitioners, APRNs, are a needed lifeline to help fill those gaps,” said Heidi Lucas, executive director of the Missouri Rural Health Association and former director of the state’s nurses association. “Putting barriers in the way to keep [nurses] from getting degrees — that’s just going to exacerbate the problems that we already have.”
She said Missouri will be short about 2,000 physicians next year.
The new rule cutting options for federal student loans would only worsen staffing shortages amid tenuous rural hospital budgets, said state-level observers. Hospitals already are grappling with millions of dollars in looming Medicaid cuts over the next 10 years, said Rich Rasmussen, president of the Oklahoma Hospital Association.
Nurse practitioners often serve as primary care providers, writing prescriptions and managing patient care. About 80% of them see Medicaid and Medicare patients, according to the American Association of Nurse Practitioners, citing federal data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
States hope to use rural health money to keep doctors, combat chronic disease

The proposal to deny advanced practice nurse practitioners the more generous loan options ignores the nation’s needs, said nurse practitioner Valerie Fuller, president of the association.
“At a time when America needs more health care providers, we can’t afford to put more obstacles in place for nurse practitioner students who want to go on and further their education and take care of the patients that need care,” said Fuller, former president of the Maine Nurse Practitioner Association. “We know it’s going to harm our workforce.”
‘Clipping the wings’
Rasmussen, of the Oklahoma Hospital Association, said he is concerned about the effect the rule will have on the pipeline for certified nurse midwives and the state’s already dwindling rural maternal health care options.
“We are clipping the wings of rural [obstetrics] to be able to blossom in our state if we’re going to put these types of restrictions on the borrowing capability of nurses who want to pursue obstetrical services in nursing as well,” he said. He added that the rules will force nurses to seek private sector loans — which don’t qualify for federal loan forgiveness programs that encourage clinicians to come work in rural areas.
Teshieka Curtis-Pugh, executive director of the South Carolina Nurses Association, is also concerned about nurse midwives. South Carolina is expected to see a shortage of 3,200 physicians by 2030.
“We also live in a state that has very poor maternal outcomes, especially for women of color. So think about, how does that impact them?” she said. “That means we don’t get the certified nurse midwives who are masters prepared, some of them are doctorally prepared, who are able to fill that gap for birth in that area.”
Diversity and opportunity for students from marginalized groups could also take a hit, said Curtis-Pugh, a registered nurse with a master’s of science in nursing. And for those going back to school while juggling parenting, federal loan dollars can help beyond tuition, she noted.
“They help that mom be able to supplement child care for their child, so that they can have child care while they go to school,” she said. “There’s tuition, there’s books, there’s keeping the lights on. They’re feeding the family they’re getting to and from.”
The exclusion from the higher, “professional” category of student loan options is especially galling after nurses’ work during the COVID-19 pandemic, said Reding, of National Nurses United.
“We were all heroes in 2020. Now, what are we?” Reding asked. “It’s a slap in the face to the nurses that go to work every day doing our very best to care for our patients, even under very adverse conditions and even facing deadly viruses.”

Clarke, the registered nurse considering a post-bachelor’s degree, said nurses’ pandemic-era devotion influenced her own career path.
“When I saw the nurses and the health care workers really working hard for their communities and sacrificing a lot, I was really inspired by that,” Clarke said. “And that’s why I went to school.”

In January, LifeWise was in about 160 Ohio school districts, making its growth this year a 62.5% increase.

This growth comes as Ohio school districts are now required to have a religious release time policy, which has helped pave the way for an expansion of LifeWise Academy. 
The new law took effect in April. Previously, the law merely permitted a religious release time policy. 
“The new release time religious education law in Ohio clarifies the rights for schools and parents to offer release time programs like LifeWise making the path to implementing these programs more straightforward for many districts,” LifeWise said in a statement to the Ohio Capital Journal. 
LifeWise is in 31 states and is approved to launch in six more states by the end of 2026. The nonprofit hopes to reach 100,000 students nationally in 2026. 
While critics of LifeWise are not surprised by the growth because of the new Ohio law, they have concerns. 
According to Education Week, at least 12 states require school districts to offer religious release time upon a parent’s request: Florida, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Vermont, and Wisconsin.
“It doesn’t seem like people are necessarily interested when you have to go change the laws because schools are telling you no and you’re taking that option away from them,” said Zach Parrish, a parent who had LifeWise file a lawsuit against him. “Of course, you’re going to grow.”  
Parrish now lives in Indiana, but his daughter was a student in Defiance City Schools in Northwest Ohio and she was bullied and ostracized for not attending LifeWise.
The United States Supreme Court upheld release time laws during the 1952 Zorach v. Clauson case, which allowed a school district to have students leave school for part of the day to receive religious instruction.
Religious release time instruction must meet three criteria: the courses must take place off school property, be privately funded, and students must have parental permission.
Northeast Ohio
LifeWise started a program at Vermilion Schools in Northeast Ohio this fall after the school district originally said no to LifeWise back in 2023, said Kitty Schwanitz, an organizer for the Secular Education Association.  
“If religion needs to be such a big part of their life, I think that they should take their kid to church, to Sunday school,” Schwanitz said. “I just think that local, organic religious instruction on parents time is best.”
The program in Vermilion currently only has three elementary students in it, she said. 
“It can’t be sustainable when you’re running numbers that low,” Parrish said. 
Schwanitz said some parents don’t know what they are getting into when they agree to let their children go to LifeWise. 
“A lot of (parents) aren’t looking at the fine print of what they’re signing up for,” she said. “And when they do they realize what their kids are being taught, and then they have to pull their kids, their kids are crying, and then they’re getting bullied. … It breaks my heart every time I read a story about another kid who is being bullied.” 
Schwanitz said her high school twins are not religious. 
“I really wanted my children to be raised without any pressure from any kind of religious organization at all,” she said. “A group like LifeWise would absolutely want to target my kids.”
Casey Bellis used to attend St. Mary Catholic Church in Vermilion, but was told by the pastor she was no longer welcome there after she started questioning why the pastor supported LifeWise. Now, she attends St. Peter Catholic Church in Huron. 
“Our pastor there is very much against (LifeWise),” Bellis said. 
St. Peter’s Pastor Rev. J. Douglas Garand wrote a letter to the parish in 2024 saying the church does not support LifeWise. 
“Let the local churches educate the member children of their communities of faith, in the ways of faith,” he wrote in the letter. 
Northwest Ohio
Matt Hollar’s daughters used to attend LifeWise at a Northwest Ohio school district.
“My older daughter — she was probably eight at the time, maybe nine — came home reciting Old Testament scripture, not understanding the ‘strict’ meaning, and certainly not capable at that age of interpreting a deeper meaning” Hollar said.
His daughter also told him she learned at LifeWise that the 2022 Pixar movie “Turning Red” was “against God’s teachings and should not be watched because it was focused on worshiping false idols.” 
“I didn’t agree and also thought it suggested that they were teaching my children at a very young age to question their own beliefs, and those I was trying to instill,” he said. 
“LifeWise makes it very clear in their own material that if the parents’ belief systems differ from LifeWise, the students are to assume that LifeWise is right and their parents, and anyone else, are wrong.”

(Photo by Graham Stokes for Ohio Capital Journal. Republish photo only with original article.)Lawyers with a reproductive rights initiative are asking the Ohio Supreme Court to intervene in a dispute against the Ohio Department of Health, in which they say the agency is withholding records related to the licensure of a clinic providing abortions.
Members of the Reproductive Rights Law Initiative at Case Western Reserve University joined with the ACLU of Ohio in a lawsuit filed Dec. 3 with the state’s highest court.
The groups said the department of health should be required to release public records related to the Toledo Women’s Center, after the agency “unreasonably delayed … granting their Jan. 2025 application to provide procedural abortions in addition to medication abortions,” the groups said in a press release.
“Transparency between citizens and government institutions remains a cornerstone of our democratic processes,” said Katie Corwin, legal fellow with the initiative. “Without it, we run the risk of losing trust and accountability.”
The center is regulated by the Ohio Department of Health as an ambulatory surgical facility.
According to the department’s database, a license for the center was issued June 24 of this year, and expires in June of 2026.
The center’s website notes a new service added, surgical abortions from five weeks to 17 weeks gestation.
The facility provides medication abortions up to 12 weeks, according to the center.

Corwin is listed as the plaintiff in the new complaint, in which she tells the court about nine public records request made starting in May of this year, asking for any emails and communications “sent or received that mention or refer to the Toledo Women’s Center” starting at the beginning of 2025.
The requests were made to the department’s chief of health care compliance, the bureau chief for the agency, and its bureau of regulatory operations, according to court documents.
She claims the Ohio Department of Health responded in June to the requests with “groundless objections” that the requests were “overly broad,” that Corwin requested “information rather than specific records” and that records were protected under attorney-client privilege.
One such rejection letter, dated June 5, said the request “does not identify specific records being sought with reasonable clarity and is too voluminous, vague, or indefinite to be properly acted on.”
“All of (the agency’s) objections are legally untenable,” Corwin said in her official complaint to the Ohio Supreme Court.
She asked the court to order that the agency provide her the records under Ohio’s Public Records Act.
Following the June denial, the attorney asked to meet with the department’s legal counsel, and submitted three “updated” requests.
In July, records were released to Corwin by the department from a previous records request, and the meeting was cancelled.
That same month, the Ohio Department of Health reiterated their objections to certain records requests, but legal counsel provided several email records “in the interest of transparency,” records that the legal counsel said the department “was able to identify based on the current wording of your request,” according to court documents.
After further back and forth between the agency, Corwin and another attorney from the initiative, the department’s legal counsel “declined to produce further emails … stating only that in ODH’s view (the requests) were ‘legally insufficient.'”
Corwin told the state supreme court that the Ohio Department of Health “has a clear legal duty” to provide the records under the public records law, and because the Toledo Women’s Center is regulated and licensed by the department.
Because of that oversight duty, the requests relate to the department of health’s “‘functions, policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the office’ and are therefore unquestionably public records.”
The Ohio Department of Health has 21 days to file a response to the complaint before the supreme court decides whether to take up the case.
If taken up by the court, the case would likely move into 2026 before further developments.
The last oral arguments of the year are scheduled for Dec. 9 and Dec. 10, and the court already has arguments scheduled through Jan. 8.

(Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)Survivors of sexual abuse at the hands of a former Ohio State University doctor protested outside the school’s Board of Trustees meeting this past Thursday.
The university has already settled cases with nearly 300 survivors of Dr. Richard Strauss to the tune of $60 million. But hundreds more survivors have so far refused to settle.
In August, the federal judge overseeing the five remaining lawsuits sent the dispute to mediation.
“It has become obvious,” Judge Michael Watson wrote, “that any litigation victory for plaintiffs may be pyrrhic.”
“The best way for plaintiffs to close this horrific chapter of their lives, and for Ohio State to move forward as a respectable institution of higher education,” he continued, “is through a mutual resolution short of trial.”
Survivors have deposed several prominent public figures in relation to the case, including Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan — an assistant wrestling coach at Ohio State during Strauss’ tenure, former athletic director Andy Geiger and two-time Heisman trophy winner Archie Griffin, who served as assistant athletic director.
In new documentary, former Ohio State wrestlers say U.S. Rep. Jim Jordan knew about Strauss abuse

But they’ve so far been unable to depose Les Wexner, the former L Brands CEO, Jeffrey Epstein confidante and perhaps Ohio State’s greatest benefactor.
Wexner’s first term on the board of trustees overlapped with Strauss’ tenure and he was chairman of the board in 1996 when disciplinary proceedings against the doctor saw him barred from treating patients in the athletics department and student health services.
The doctor remained a tenured faculty member until 1998, though, and he quickly set up a private off-campus clinic where he continued to sexually abuse patients.
When he retired, Strauss was granted emeritus status.

Survivors’ protest
Outside the trustees meeting, survivors like Stephen Snyder-Hill waved signs reading “Where’s Wexner.”
Board chairman, John Zeiger, used to be Wexner’s attorney. His son and law partner Matthew Zeiger now represents Wexner.
“I think our biggest beef right now is that there’s a lot of really gross internal conflicts, in our opinion,” Snyder-Hill said.
“Because Zeiger, his kid, represents Wexner, who’s on our list to be subpoenaed, and his kid is not letting him take a subpoena, so they’re just evading the law, and he sits in there on the board.”
Thursday’s meeting was the first they’ve attended since OSU President Ted Carter assumed his office.
But Snyder-Hill didn’t sound optimistic about his impact on court-ordered mediation. He pointed to Carter’s comments to The Lantern early this year about a different lawsuit.
The school was forced to move hundreds of students after finding mold in a residential tower. But when he was asked about a lawsuit tied to the incident, Carter said “most people are going to find we don’t settle.”
Adding to survivors’ frustration is the recent hire of E. Gordon Gee. The former OSU president led the school at the time of disciplinary actions against Strauss, and the doctor twice appealed to Gee directly in hopes of having his privileges to see students on-campus reinstated.
Gee’s administration didn’t let Strauss back, but neither did it pursue the matter further.
Tom Lisy speaking to reporters. (Photo by Nick Evans, Ohio Capital Journal.)
When attorneys working on OSU’s internal investigation spoke to Gee, he couldn’t recall the correspondence from Strauss. But Gee said his staffers “would have briefed him on Strauss’ situation at the time, and that he ‘would have directed them to handle it.’”
“And then Ted Carter calls him his ‘wing man?’” Snyder-Hill said in disbelief. “I’m like, that’s a poor choice of words right now, especially if he had any knowledge of this back then, and he did.”
Tom Lisy graduated from Ohio State in 1991. As a freshman on the wrestling team, he explained, Strauss assaulted him on two occasions. Like Snyder-Hill, he isn’t expecting mediation to reach an agreement that leaves both sides feeling whole.
“I don’t think it’s possible for us to feel whole,” he said. “I mean, based on what we’ve been through as students, and based on now what we’ve been through as alumni.”
“On the front side, they had a chance to try to mend fences, in a sense, and that time has passed.” Lisy added.
He sees the university’s obstinance as a misguided exercise in brand protection. The school pursued a bid to dismiss cases under the statute limitations all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. But after the justices declined to hear Ohio State’s appeal the cases were able to go forward.
That pyrrhic victory Judge Watson talked about? That’s on school leaders, Lisy said.
“They’ve already done damage the university. They’ve done damage to the student body. They’ve done damage to the image,” he said. “When they first found out about Strauss, that was the time to do something, and they didn’t do it.”

The meeting
After an hour outside in the cold, the demonstrators filed inside to the meeting — grumbling somewhat at school officials asking them to remove their signs’ wooden handles.
They stood in the back quietly holding their signs while President Carter read his report and the board moved through its agenda. There were no outbursts and the whole thing was over in less than half an hour.
Any hopes of speaking directly to President Carter were disappointed. He left through a back door. Board chair John Zeiger declined to speak to the press.
In a written statement, university spokesman Ben Johnson noted the school has already settled with more than half of those who have come forward with claims.
“All male students who filed lawsuits have been offered the opportunity to settle,” he wrote. “In addition, the university continues to cover the cost of professionally certified counseling services and other medical treatment, including reimbursement for counseling and treatment received in the past.”
“Ohio State led the effort to investigate and expose Richard Strauss, and we express our deep regret and apologies to all who experienced Strauss’ abuse,” Johnson added.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)The Kansas Republican Party has pickled itself in a brackish brine of racism, homophobia and intolerance.
Officials can dissemble all they want, but the party can’t hope to represent everyday Kansans while tasting so sour. Poorly canned pickles can give you botulism, remember.
This distasteful metaphor suggested itself as the party staggered from embarrassment to embarrassment in recent months. You’ll recall the racist and white supremacist texts shared by young Republicans. GOP officials condemned the rhetoric. But on Nov. 28, the state party’s social media accounts posted a screed against democratic Gov. Laura Kelly from Ellis County GOP chairman Adam Peters.
Kansas Reflector readers might remember him as a central figure in our 2023 Church and State series. In recordings obtained by Kansas Reflector, Peters called for turning Kansas into a conservative sanctuary.
“If you can make it hostile to that group of people, that small sliver of society, and have them move elsewhere, that does a huge amount to shut this down,” he said of liberal Kansans.
While decrying “Antifa tactics,” Peters also told his audience: “We need to use the tools that are at our disposal. You know, if we look in scripture, there was a time when the nation of Israel had to take up arms in defense of themselves.”
He offered an offensive jumble of takes about race, suggesting all humans shared a common ancestry while saying “the main reason why Black suspects are disproportionately killed by the police is they disproportionately tried to kill the police.” He hinted that pastors who supported LGBTQ+ people had signed contracts with Satan.
The Ellis County party tried to deny that Peters had made such statements. But they were recorded for all to hear and judge.
No sane party seeking to appeal to mainstream voters would elevate someone like Peters. His apparent beliefs, as reported more than two years ago, should raise alarm bells for anyone. On the other hand, he said mean things about Kelly, so perhaps all was forgiven.
I reached out to state Republican Party Chairwoman Danedri Herbert for comment Friday evening. She didn’t respond by press time.
Meanwhile, one of the young Republicans at the center of the texting scandal made an unwelcome return to public view. The New York Times, of all outlets, elevated William Hendrix in a bewildering profile from Sabrina Tavernise and Georgia Gee. The organization’s former vice chairman used the words “n–ga” and “n–guh” and noted that “Missouri doesn’t like f–s.” I’m not sure why the Times decided to broadcast Hendrix’s self justifications across the nation. A slow news day, perhaps?
Hendrix, apparently unlike those of us who don’t text racist epithets to one another, just wants to support his family and live his life. The rest of us don’t have the opportunity to have our profiles boosted by the nation’s newspaper of record.
Regardless of my quibbles, state GOP leaders promptly exiled Hendrix and dissolved the Young Republicans after Politico exposed texts. They destroyed his future in the party. Yet just a few weeks later, they elevated Peters, whose comments were made at a public forum and shared throughout the state.
I’ve written this before and I’ll write it again: The Kansas Republican Party cannot have it both ways. It cannot claim to despise discrimination while tolerating a host of hatreds within its ranks.
Don’t believe me? Try Republican condemnation of supposedly homophobic remarks directed toward Rep. Kyler Sweely, R-Hutchison. Its detestation of homophobia lasts until the point when lawmakers are asked to support gay children. The Kansas GOP also opposes racism, until a Black Democrat calls out double standards on the House floor and gets hauled into a disciplinary hearing.
Not all Republicans behave this way or believe these things. That’s what makes it bad.
When I lived for more than a decade in New Hampshire, I knew prominent Republicans. They believed in racial equality. They supported gay rights. They supported fiscal discipline, personal moderation and loathing of income taxes. They would have unhesitatingly purged their beloved party of the kind of vile nihilism you see in Kansas.
I might not have agreed with New Hampshire Republicans’ ideology. But their lack of overt hate sure made them more appealing. I suspect swing voters liked them, too.
The First Amendment still applies, of course. Anyone should feel free to believe anything they want as long as it does not involve physically harming or threatening others. Political parties have the same freedom. However, every one of us has the choice to coddle or confront. If members of your coalition hold offensive and destructive beliefs, you can make it clear they’re not welcome. Republicans can survive and thrive without white supremacists, homophobes and Groypers.
 If the Republican brand has truly been pickled beyond palatability, voters can make their own choice. Pick a fresh cucumber and start again.

(Photo by Denis Smith)Bob Dylan got it right years ago. “You don’t need a weatherman to know which way the wind blows,” the folk music icon opined, particularly when it comes to detecting the views of Ohio school board members.
Indeed, there wasn’t a meteorologist in sight when more than 6,500 school board members, superintendents, and district treasurers gathered at the Columbus Convention Center for the annual Capital Conference of the Ohio School Boards Association.  
According to reports, attendees represented 89% of the state’s 607 school districts and provide a good sample to gauge the level of current thinking among school boards and their administrative leadership about the major issues facing public education.
Ready for a surprise? 
The top issue facing Ohio schools isn’t a shortage of bus drivers, scarce substitute teachers, or funding for aging school buses. 
It’s the expanded universal private school voucher program that is devastating the long-range viability of public education and diverting more than $1 billion annually from the state treasury to support private and religious schools.
That concern about dwindling state support for public education came through loud and clear from school board members who stopped by the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding and Vouchers Hurt Ohio exhibit booth to offer their concerns about the expansion of vouchers and the harm they inflict on public schools. 
As a volunteer at the conference for the last fourteen years, there is no question that the response from board members I spoke with last week about the Ohio legislature’s continued bad behavior directed at public education was the strongest during this time period. 
A few examples:
“I’m a lifelong Republican,” a school board member from Southwest Ohio told me, “but the harm being done to public education by the legislature has to stop.” 
He spoke to me as we stood in front of an easel that displayed the heart of the lawsuit against educational vouchers and the legislature’s unconstitutional support for religious schools.
Another board member, also from Southwest Ohio, stopped by the Ohio E&A/Vouchers Hurt Ohio exhibit booth to express her strong feelings about the voucher expansion and its support of religious schools. 
As a board member, she related, “I’ve personally supported Catholic schools over the years, but vouchers are wrong and are harming public education.”
That board member’s words reflect the general mood of the attendees who represent a cross-section of Ohioans from rural, urban, and suburban areas. 
This year, they are more forthcoming on how they feel about vouchers. 
Here’s why.
Display seen at Ohio School Board Association Conference. (Photo by Denis Smith)
On June 24, Franklin County Common Pleas Judge Jaiza Page ruled in a 47-page decision that educational vouchers are violative of the state constitution because they create multiple school systems rather than a common system open to all children, fail to adequately fund a thorough and efficient system, and transfer public funds to religious schools in violation of Article VI, Section 2. 
The plaintiffs had argued that more than 90% of the private schools in the state are religious institutions, thus a clear constitutional violation.
The ruling supported the plaintiffs on three of the five counts in the lawsuit. 
Judge Page’s decision was appealed by the State Defendants and will be considered by the 10th District Court of Appeals. 
Ultimately, the case will be decided by the Ohio Supreme Court.
An added incentive driving more districts to join the lawsuit was the inaction of the legislature to address the Cupp-Patterson funding plan that was introduced into the state budget in 2022.  
William Phillis, a former deputy state superintendent of schools and executive director of the Ohio Coalition for Equity & Adequacy of School Funding, weighed in on the legislature’s neglect of duty in maintaining the constitution’s requirement to guarantee “a thorough and efficient system of common schools.”
“There were high hopes that the Cupp-Patterson plan would be fully phased in for FY2026 and beyond, but the legislature scuttled the plan and punished school districts in a plethora of ways. Meanwhile, the trial court judge ruled EdChoice vouchers unconstitutional. The court decision and the legislature’s failure to adopt a completely phased-in Cupp-Patterson plan turned many school district leaders toward the EdChoice voucher litigation. So interest in the litigation was at a higher level among school district leadership personnel than in previous years.”
Phillis has led the fight for adequate school funding since the landmark 1997 DeRolph v Ohio decision, where the state Supreme Court found that reliance on local property taxes to fund schools created inherently unequal educational outcomes because of the varying level of assessed value among local school districts. 
His role during the last quarter-century as a watchdog on the legislature to ensure that schools are properly funded has made him an eminent figure who inspired the formation of other groups to assist him in supporting public education.
Shortly after the conclusion of the OSBA conference, I spoke with Jeanne Melvin, President of Public Education Partners (Disclosure: I am also a PEP member) who, like me, also volunteered in the exhibit booth. She also saw a decided change in mood among board members, particularly those from rural districts, where their constituents don’t have private schools to choose from but see larger school districts that have nearby private and religious schools benefiting from this decided imbalance.
“I have had the opportunity to speak with school board members, superintendents, and school treasurers in the Vouchers Hurt Ohio booth at the Ohio School Boards Conference for a few years,” Melvin stated. 
“In the past, I was disappointed at the number of education leaders that told me school vouchers were here to stay, and there was absolutely nothing they could do about it.” 
That was then. But things have changed among board members and school leaders. 
Melvin has also seen a change in the prevailing wind direction.
“Ever since the judge ruled in June that Ohio’s EdChoice voucher program is unconstitutional, opinion has changed. School district leaders and residents finally realize that the voucher agenda was created by a legislature that seeks to privatize our system of public schools, and they are angry. The success of pro-public education board candidates and school levies this election cycle has ignited a passion to fight back.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Indeed, school boards are fighting back, and with the recent election that saw a number of school board candidates defeat conservatives who were otherwise acquiescent on the voucher imbroglio, even more districts are expected to join the anti-voucher lawsuit.
“Parents are concerned about the long-term effects of district tax money being funneled to unaccountable private schools,” Jeanne Melvin think. “ Taxpayers are speaking up and demanding that their local public schools be protected.”
As the Voucher Hurt Ohio banner at the OSBA Capital Conference proclaimed, “We are winning!”
Those who support their community’s schools, the bedrock of so many zipcodes on the map, would agree. 
Let’s hope that the Supreme Court will stand in support of defending the Ohio Constitution and its clear language in affirming that “no religious or other sect, or sects, shall ever have any exclusive right to, or control of, any parts of the school funds of this State.”
If the Supremes have trouble with comprehending these unambiguous words, they need to be enrolled in a Science of Reading class. 
The question about whether the universal voucher program is constitutional or not means that the Supreme Court must rise above politics and apply the law as it is clearly spelled out in Article VI, Sec. 2 of the Ohio Constitution.

WILMINGTON —  It’s time for the Governor’s  Volunteer Service Awards as we enters the holiday season. State leaders are urging residents to take a moment to recognize the thousands of volunteers whose time, talent and compassion fuel community programs year-round — from food banks and senior centers to youth sports, arts organizations, environmental groups and neighborhood nonprofits.
That spirit of service is at the heart of the 2026 Delaware Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards, with nominations now open through January 10, 2026. The awards, now in their 44th year, honor individuals and groups whose work strengthens communities across all three counties.
“Every day in Delaware, volunteers step forward without expecting recognition,” state officials said in announcing the launch of this year’s nomination cycle. “These awards allow us to shine a light on those who make our state stronger, kinder and more connected.”
Celebrating the People Behind Delaware’s Volunteer Network
Nonprofits and community groups across the state say the need for volunteers is never greater than during the holiday season, when food insecurity rises, seniors face greater isolation and families turn to local organizations for support.
From youth mentors and environmental stewards to medical volunteers, library helpers and neighborhood organizers, Delaware’s volunteer corps reflects a broad range of skills and passions. Past honorees have included:


Adult volunteers leading long-term mentoring and community health projects.


Youth volunteers creating school-based service programs and organizing donation drives.


Service groups and nonprofits coordinating food distribution, literacy initiatives and environmental cleanup efforts.


Lifetime achievers who have spent decades improving their communities through consistent, selfless service.


Over the past four decades, hundreds of Delawareans have been honored as role models who inspire others to give back.
How the 2026 Nomination Process Works
The Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards are administered by the Delaware Department of Health and Social Services (DHSS) through the State Office of Volunteerism.
Key details include:


Nominations opened: December 2, 2025


Deadline: January 10, 2026


Award Ceremony: May 2026


Eligibility: Individuals, youth, groups, and organizations that have performed exceptional volunteer service in Delaware.


Categories typically include:


Adult Volunteer


Youth Volunteer


Group/Organization


Lifetime Achievement




Nominations may highlight contributions in areas such as community well-being, youth and families, health services, arts and culture, environmental protection, or nonprofit capacity-building.
Officials encourage Delawareans to nominate volunteers who have demonstrated leadership, creativity, compassion and measurable impact in their communities.
A Call to Recognize Local Heroes
As holiday events, charity drives and community gatherings continue throughout December, state leaders say this is an ideal time to showcase the importance of volunteerism.
“Delaware’s volunteers are the heartbeat of our state,” officials said. “By nominating someone for the Governor’s Volunteer Service Awards, you’re helping to tell the stories of people who give of themselves quietly, consistently and with tremendous heart.”
Nomination forms and full guidelines are available through the State Office of Volunteerism.

(Courtesy of U.S. Department of Agriculture)A parade of recent events has reminded us that a company town in Nebraska will no longer be keeping company there, vaccine “experts” recommend we relive the 1950s and, remarkedly, two U.S. senators can view the same bombing video and reach opposite conclusions. Surely, those headlines evoked some rage — a word that these days covers the gamut from snit to, well, actual rage.
Speaking of which, we also had this recently: The Oxford English Dictionary announced that “rage bait” was its Word of the Year. If you’re keeping score at home, the dictionary folks define rage bait as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular webpage or social media account.” Chuffing for clicks, if you will.
No word on whether any lexicographer among the judges had cast a vote for “waste, fraud and abuse,” a tried and true bit of tedious phraseology too often used to slash and burn valuable government programs, which help millions. Babies and bathwater, that sort of thing.
Food as a ‘bargaining chip’
Any thought on “waste, fraud, and abuse” also lent itself to this space revisiting the current administration’s continued occupation of the moral lowground, a place it found to its liking during an extended government shutdown. Withholding food became a cruel negotiating strategy during those dark days.
The White House is back … and food is once again a bargaining chip.
Since last summer, the U.S. Department of Agriculture — citing efforts to eliminate the aforementioned “waste, fraud and abuse” — has demanded that states forward the names, dates of birth, home addresses, Social Security numbers and benefit totals of those enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program or SNAP. About 42 million Americans, including 150,000 Nebraskans, depend on SNAP to put food on their tables.
Twenty-eight states with Republican governors — including Nebraska — have forwarded the data. The others have resisted, backed by a federal judge’s October decision barring the feds from collecting the information. Now, USDA has given the recalcitrants until this week to send the particulars or it would start withholding SNAP payments in those states, which happen to have Democratic governors. Go figure. 
Fraud does happen
To be clear: We have waste, fraud and abuse in government. SNAP is no exception. No one is arguing otherwise. USDA hasn’t released verifiable numbers but has thrown out figures gleaned from the states that have reported data to the feds to make its case for the rest of the data. Running those amounts rounded out to about 3% of recipients misusing funds. 
Also, the Government Accounting Office reports that EBT benefit cards, which lack chip technology, are prime targets for theft through cloning, skimming and other schemes. How obtaining states’ recipients data addresses those problems remains unclear.
Nor does the latest full frontal federal foray into combatting real or imagined financial inefficiencies inspire much confidence. The now-defunct Department of Government Efficiency, unaffectionately known as DOGE, promised taxpayers $1 trillion in savings by ferreting out “waste, fraud and abuse.” By the time the coders-doing-the-work-of-auditors logged out, however, the net gain wasn’t in the ballpark. DOGE itself estimated the number was $180 billion, but others, including NPR, could verify only a $2.3 billion savings.
Think about impacts
The cuts come with human costs, too. A Boston University epidemiologist and infectious disease researcher estimated that after DOGE shuttered the U.S. Agency for International Development, USAID, in July, more than 600,000 people had already died as a result of the cut.
Finally, wide and polychromatic is the palette of those who benefit from government programs through direct benefits, tax breaks, health insurance programs, subsidies, bailouts and forgivable loans. All those programs mean our tax dollars benefit people from the most vulnerable, who live paycheck to paycheck or homeless shelter to homeless shelter, to those inC-suites noodling how to use tax laws and regulatory processes to increase their bottom lines, to the millions of us in between. Surely we need all their data, too?
But that’s not really the question or the point. This is: Somehow, under the guise of finding the wasteful, the fraudulent and the abusive allegedly fleecing the USDA, our best idea is to threaten the food security of millions of Americans? 
We can’t do any better administratively? Morally? If that’s the bait that ignites rage, perhaps more of us should take it, insisting as we do that those with the power to find solutions to modern problems do so without the cruelty.

Cleo Fields was one of three candidates to sign up to run for the new 6th Congressional district race.  (Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)The Louisiana Board of Ethics fined Congressman Cleo Fields $2,500 Friday for not submitting a report documenting the remaining funds and debts for the campaign account from his Public Service Commission run more than 20 years ago. 
Fields, who was elected to his current term in Congress in 2024, declined to comment on the fine when reached by phone Friday. 
The Baton Rouge Democrat lost the District 3 public service commissioner race to Lambert Boissiere in a 2004 runoff election. The missing report, due in February of this year, would have documented any spending or debt forgiveness in 2024 from that campaign. 
For several years, elected officials have been required to file reports for old election accounts as long as more than $2,500 in contributions or debts remain in them. In June, Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers adjusted this reporting standard, raising the threshold to $5,000. 

Fields’s old account meets the standards for reporting regardless of the threshold in place. At the end of 2023, it had $3,470 in leftover contributions and $317,000 in outstanding loans made from Fields personally, according to a report he previously submitted. 

Through a letter, the congressman had asked the ethics board to waive the fine. Its members declined to do so at the recommendation of the ethics board staff. 

The board did not discuss why they chose not to waive or reduce Fields’ fine, but they frequently turn down such requests if the elected official or candidate has previously missed deadlines for campaign finance reporting. 

Fields’ had missed a campaign finance deadline in 2019, when he filed a report for his successful Louisiana Senate election 10 days late. He also paid late fees when he missed campaign finance reporting deadlines by two months each for state senate elections in 1995, 1997 and 1999, according to the ethics board staff. Those fines totaled $2,980 and were paid in full years ago.SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/IMG_1620-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-12-08 02:56:24.959780

Overview of the Redding Consortium
The Redding Consortium for Educational Equity is a state-appointed advisory body established in 2019 under Delaware House Bill 222. Its primary mandate is to recommend policies and practices to the Governor and General Assembly to improve educational equity and outcomes for Pre-K through grade 12 students in Wilmington and northern New Castle County. A core focus is redistricting the fragmented school boundaries in the area, which currently involve portions of four districts—Brandywine, Colonial, Christina, and Red Clay—serving Wilmington students. This fragmentation has led to long bus rides, resource inequities, and challenges in serving high-needs students, including English learners and low-income families. The consortium’s efforts build on prior failed attempts, such as the 2015 Wilmington Education Improvement Commission (WEIC) plan.
In addition to redistricting, the consortium supports broader initiatives like expanding early childhood education, in-school health services, wraparound programs (e.g., before/after-school and summer supports), teacher premium pay in high-needs schools, and specialized magnet programs in elementary schools. For fiscal year 2025, it allocated a $14.6 million budget, including $3.7 million for pre-K expansion, $5.7 million for health and extended-time services, and $1.6 million specifically for redistricting planning related to the Christina School District.
Redistricting Plans for New Castle County School Districts
The consortium’s redistricting work aims to consolidate districts, reduce socioeconomic segregation, improve access to resources, and shorten commutes for Wilmington students (who are often bused to suburban schools as far as Glasgow High School). An interim plan was approved in May 2024, recommending the removal of Christina School District from serving Wilmington (due to its non-contiguous boundaries and low enrollment from the city—only 41% of potential students opt in). This interim framework outlines boundary shifts, immediate supports for city schools, a public engagement timeline, and policy reforms.
As of November 2025, the consortium has narrowed its options to three models for reshaping northern New Castle County districts. A vote to select one is scheduled for December 16, 2025, followed by drafting a full plan in January 2026, public hearings in February (at least one per affected district, with two in Wilmington), and State Board of Education review from March to May 2026. Implementation, if approved by the General Assembly and Governor via joint resolution, would not occur until 3–5 years later (likely 2028–2030). The models exclude Colonial and Christina from future Wilmington service in most cases, aligning with the “River Plan” supported by Wilmington city officials for geographic proximity and reduced travel times.
Key Redistricting Models Under Consideration
Two-District Option (Brandywine and Red Clay Split)
Splits the City of Wilmington between Brandywine and Red Clay districts (e.g., along Market Street, with Brandywine taking the east and Red Clay the west). Brandywine and Red Clay remain separate; Colonial and Christina serve only suburban areas.
Metropolitan Wilmington District
Merges Brandywine, Red Clay, and Wilmington (including Christina’s four city schools: Bayard, Pritchett, Pulaski, Stubbs) into one new district. Colonial and Christina continue serving suburbs only.
Northern New Castle County Consolidated District
Full merger of all four districts (Brandywine, Christina, Colonial, Red Clay) into one mega-district covering northern New Castle County.
These models must align with 13 stipulations in Delaware Code, including reducing low-income student concentration, enhancing supports for at-risk students, and ensuring cooperation from districts and charters (e.g., data sharing on students, finances, and facilities). The selected model will incorporate community feedback from ongoing town halls, such as the December 4, 2025, Christina Board workshop.
Broader Equity Initiatives Tied to Redistricting
While redistricting is central, the consortium’s plans emphasize holistic supports:

Early Learning and Wraparounds: Expanding pre-K slots and funding before/after-school programs.
Teacher Incentives: Premium pay for educators in high-needs schools, building on Christina-Wilmington pilots.
Specialized Programs: Magnet options in elementaries and better English learner services.
Collaborations: Initiatives like Boost ’22–’26 for cross-district graduation improvements and the Wilmington Learning Collaborative for targeted city supports.

Political divisions persist—e.g., between Gov. Meyer’s preference for consolidation and concerns from former Governor (now, Mayor of Wilmington) John Carney’s allies—but the December vote marks a pivotal step after years of delays.

(Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)ST PETERSBURG — Could Gwen Graham add heft to David Jolly’s candidacy for governor by becoming his running mate in Florida next year?
That question occurred when the former Tallahassee-based U.S. representative appeared with Jolly last week during a political rally in Pinellas County that drew 400-plus attendees.
Jolly has been crisscrossing the Sunshine State since entering the Democratic race for governor in June, and the event at 535 Nova — a wedding venue — was his 130th public gathering since he entered the contest, but the first time he appeared with Graham, the closest thing to Florida Democratic Party royalty. She’s a daughter of Bob Graham, the former Florida governor and U.S. senator who died last year at 87.
In an interview before the Thursday event, Gwen Graham, who served in Congress with Jolly from 2015-2017, said it was a “no-brainer” that she would support the former Republican for governor.
“I would not be standing here if I didn’t know he could win,” she said. “This election is too important. We’ve got to have a candidate in November who can win so we can start reversing the damage that has been done to the state that I love and my father loved, and David can win. So, I’m going to do whatever I can to help him do that.”
Many political analysts considered Graham the favorite to capture the Democratic nomination for governor in 2018, but she ended up losing to then Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum by three percentage points in that year’s primary election. She went on to serve in President Joe Biden’s administration as assistant secretary for legislation and congressional affairs at the U.S. Department of Education from 2021 to 2025.
In introducing Jolly to the audience in St. Petersburg last week, Graham said she was nervous because it was her first public appearance since the death of her father, who served as Florida’s 38th governor from 1979 to 1987 and in the U.S. Senate from 1987 to 2005.
“I hear my dad’s voice in David’s commitment to the values that I have grown up with and lived,” she said in her speech. 
“I hear David’s voice talking about what he cares about for the future of this state. So, while David knows this race will be difficult, the moment is too important. We must all stand together and do our part to define what Florida will look like as a state for the next century.”
Jolly deflected when asked before the event whether he was considering Graham to serve as his running mate, but did say, “We’re going to name a lieutenant governor candidate very early. We’re not going to wait until the primary. And I hope we see Gwen Graham in office again in the state of Florida.”
Considering a Jolly-Graham ticket
Longtime Hillsborough County Democratic strategist Victor DiMaio served at one time as a press secretary for Bob Graham. Having Gwen Graham on Jolly’s ticket makes sense on several levels, he said.
“Gwen would be an excellent choice if that’s what [Jolly] decides to do,” he said. “It didn’t hurt other governors who have selected women as lieutenant governors.”
Angela Birdsong, president of the Hillsborough County Democratic Black Caucus, believes Gillum would have defeated Ron DeSantis in 2018 if he had selected Graham, instead of Chris King, to serve as his running mate.
“She would bring in more conservative Democrats, and independents would love her,” Birdsong said of Graham’s appeal in 2026. When asked if that ticket might prove to be too moderate for Florida Democrats, Birdsong disagreed. “I’m with Jasmine Crockett — I think that we’re going to have to run some vanilla candidates for a while.”
(Crockett. a progressive Democratic member of Congress from Texas, said in an interview on Sirius/XM radio in May that, following the Democratic Party’s losses to Donald Trump with Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton, “we just want to win.”
(She added, “So, there’s a lot of people that are like, ‘You know what? Like, let’s go find the safest white boy we can find.’ I mean, I’m just saying.”)
Some political consultants believe a Democratic gubernatorial ticket consisting of Jolly, a former Republican, and Graham, a political moderate, may offer a general election appeal to a Florida electorate that has moved considerably to the political right during the past eight years.
But it might be a dead letter within the more progressive precincts of the Florida Democratic Party.
Carolina Ampudia is a former chair of the Democratic Progressive Caucus in Florida. She sees a Jolly-Graham ticket as “a pathetic retreat, not a step forward.”
“Jolly has a Republican record and ties to Scientology. Graham voted to fast-track the Keystone pipeline and built her career on centrism. Neither of them represents the communities that have been fighting on the frontlines for labor rights, racial justice, LGBTQ+ protections, public education, or environmental survival,” she said in a text message.
“Florida doesn’t need a rebranded Republican and a legacy name,” she continued. “We need leadership that reflects the courage and clarity of the people — not the fears of consultants and donors.”
Florida’s last two elected governors, Ron DeSantis and Rick Scott, both named women as their running mates (DeSantis selected Jeanette Nuñez in 2018 and Scott picked Jennifer Carroll in 2010). Charlie Crist selected female running mates in his two unsuccessful bids as a Democrat for governor in 2014 and 2022 (Annette Taddeo in ’14 and Karla Hernández-Mats in ’22).
Meanwhile, discussion about a potential running mate for Jolly comes amid a challenge for the Democratic nomination by Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, who announced his candidacy a month ago. No major polls comparing the two Democrats have been published since his entry.
Uphill climb
On the GOP side, southwest Florida U.S. Rep. Byron Donalds is dominating in the polling. According to a survey of 800 likely Republican voters conducted by Florida pollster Ryan Tyson for the American Promise last month, Donalds, who has been endorsed by President Trump, received 43% support while a majority of the electorate (51%) remained unsure. Former House Speaker Paul Renner received 2% of the vote. Lt. Gov. Jay Collins, who has not formally entered the race, received 1%.
A poll conducted by the University of North Florida’s Public Opinion Research Lab of 728 likely voters between Donalds and Jolly in October (before Demings entered the contest) showed Donalds leading both Jolly and Demings by double digits.
The eventual Democratic nominee will be a decided underdog. Florida has not elected a Democrat to lead the state since Lawton Chiles in 1994.
Even before he entered the race for governor in June, Jolly had been talking about affordability, which has emerged as a buzzword in U.S. politics following Zohran Mamdani’s victory in the New York City mayor’s race last month.
Thursday night, Jolly said concerns about the quality of life for everyday Floridians encompasses “more than affordability.”
“Affordability is, ‘Am I going to be able to afford rent or housing this week or this month.’ That is real. That’s a crisis. But we’re at a generational inflection point,” he said. 
“I think that if Republicans continue with their policies, we’re going to lose the middle in the state of Florida and people are going to begin leaving at a quicker rate than we’re already seeing.”
Among the issues he addressed during his 50-minute-plus speech was the state’s universal school choice program, which expanded significantly in 2023 and was found by a state audit to feature “a myriad of accountability problems.”
“They don’t have to provide an individual education program,” Jolly said of private schools that accept state tuition subsidies.
“They don’t have to provide excellence in academics. Trigonometry in the 10th grade. Access to the trades. Access to the arts. They don’t have to provide any of that because there’s no standards on our choice schools. And so, just like Jeb Bush 25 years ago made the argument that he’s siding with Florida’s kids and families, guess what? Now we are. Because he used to say that public schools were leaving the kids behind. Now are choice schools leaving your kids behind? That’s what’s happening in the state of Florida.”
A plan to add funding for public education 
Jolly has proposed a “10-year renaissance” in public education, advocating for a proposed constitutional amendment that would steer a portion of tourist development tax receipts into public education to pay teachers 30% more.
Tourist development taxes are levied in 62 of  Florida’s 67 counties with rates ranging from 2% to 6% on sales. State law requires at least 40% of all tourist development tax revenues collected in a county to be spent to promote and advertise tourism.
“We build convention centers with it. We advertise beaches on the Chicago ‘L’ in January. … But guess what? We don’t have a crisis of convention centers in the state of Florida, we have a crisis in education,” Jolly said.",https://floridaphoenix.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/0-2-1024x771.jpeg,,,2025-12-08 00:58:13.641834

I am the mother of a caring 11-year-old boy who loves screen time, and it is a constant struggle to get him to disconnect from the screens. During the COVID-19 pandemic, screens became essential for school and socialization, but the habit never truly ended.  Now, children use electronics more than ever at home, in classrooms, and during downtime. 
I often see parents, including myself, overwhelmed by the challenge of setting limits. This reality highlights the urgent need for healthcare providers to offer families practical tools and resources, like the American Academy of Pediatrics’ (AAP) Family Media Plan (FMP), to help balance technology use from the comfort of one’s home. Supporting families through using this tool can make a meaningful difference in restoring health and awareness in reducing screen time.
Excessive screen time has become a growing public health concern, and I have witnessed how this affects children’s health. On average, children spend four to six hours daily on screens, exceeding the AAP’s recommendations of no more than one to two hours per day.  
Following COVID-19, digital use for both learning and leisure has continued to rise, contributing to obesity, poor sleep, poor posture, myopia, and mental health problems such as anxiety and depression. Many families struggle to manage screen use, highlighting the need for structured guidance such as the AAP’s family medical plan. 


Some may argue that screen time is an unavoidable part of modern education and social connection. On average, the typical child receives their first phone at 11 years old. Certainly, technology can support learning, creativity, and communication when used appropriately. However, the problem arises when recreational use exceeds healthy limits, leading to negative effects on sleep, attention, and physical health. The goal of the family medical plan is not to eliminate technology but to find the balance in its intentional use. By setting clear boundaries, families can ensure their benefits while reducing harm to children.
A policy-based solution to excessive screen time is the integration of the AAP’s family medical plan into primary care practice. Using this evidence-based approach may help families in setting screen time limits, scheduling tech-free activities, and promoting healthier digital habits.. By implementing the plan during routine wellness visits, providers can educate parents, support prevention, and reduce potential risks such as obesity and behavioral issues that come with excessive screen time. Standardizing its use and plan across pediatric settings ensures consistent guidance for all families and helps children reduce the risk of future mental and physical challenges.

It’s a true story, and it’s the basis for the children’s book And Tango Makes Three. 
The book tells the story of two male chinstrap penguins, Roy and Silo, who built a nest, took turns brooding an egg, and raised the female chick that hatched from it named Tango. The message of love and its depiction of diverse families, however, proved too controversial. Parents, school boards, and other groups across the United States attacked the book, arguing that its representation of a same-sex relationship was “anti-family” and unsuitable for young children. 



This book, and thousands of others, have faced widespread attacks across the United States and in local communities, signalling an alarming trend toward censorship of gender identity, sexual orientation, and marginalized groups. 
Book banning is not a new phenomenon. The United States has a long and reprehensible history of book banning. Historically, books were banned on the grounds of sexual imagery, violence, or obscenity, though defining these terms remains controversial and debated today. This legacy is powerful, and though the practice is not new, it should never be normalized. 
The rise of book banning in the 21st century is startling, as bans have extended farther in reach and scale in recent years. Book banning in the United States is just one example of a striking turn to authoritarianism. For instance, the anti-LGBTQIA+ sentiment that often drives book banning threatens democratic norms. This is emblematic of broader authoritarian attacks in the United States against racial justice, reproductive rights, political dissent, and more. 
Since 2021, there have been 23,000 book bans in public schools in the United States. A national study carried out by PEN America found that in just one academic year, from 2024 to 2025, there were 6,780 instances of book bans. Of these titles, a large number of books dealt with LGBTQIA+ topics or had LGBTQIA+ protagonists or characters.

Another study found that, out of 1,154 books banned in a nine-month period, 33% dealt with LGBTQIA+ topics, and 41% of the fiction novels and non-fiction books featured protagonists of color. 
But the problem of book banning can be felt much closer to home. 
In March of this year, in my hometown of Suffield, Connecticut, the Library Commission considered a proposal that would remove books with subject matter related to gender identity from the children’s section of Kent Memorial Library. 
This is not the first time the small town has seen controversy over its censorship in the public library. In 2023, the Director of Kent Memorial Library, Julie Styles, resigned from her role on the basis of political interference.
Suffield First Selectman Colin Moll forced Styles to remove the book “What Are Your Words” from display in the children’s section of Kent Memorial Library after complaints from town residents about its content on gender-inclusive pronouns.
 In a farewell letter published in The Suffield Observer, Styles wrote that she was also asked to tag all LGBTQIA+ books with warning labels and to limit displays that featured books on current affairs or that were representative of marginalized communities. 
In 2022, Connecticut saw 29 reported library title challenges according to the American Library Association. Just one year later, that number was 117. 
These numbers are alarming. More worrying, though, is that they actually are modest measurements. Underreporting of book bans and challenges means that books continue to be censored with little to no coverage from the media, leaving us with little knowledge of the true extent of book bans both in Connecticut and at the national level. 
Statistics are telling, but they don’t speak about the child who sees their identity weaponized. 
“When children cannot find themselves reflected in the books they read, or when the images they see are distorted, negative, or laughable, they learn a powerful lesson about how they are devalued in the society of which they are a part,” says ​​Dr. Rudine Sims Bishop, ​​professor emerita of Education at The Ohio State University and known as the “mother of” multicultural children’s literature.
Recently, the Connecticut General Assembly passed legislation containing provisions on public libraries’ collection and review policies. After the provisions were added to the state budget, the law required school boards across the state to adopt various policies on issues such as displays, material reviews, and more. Importantly, the law prevents books from being abruptly pulled from shelves, requiring proper school material reconsideration. The law also states that reconsideration requests can only be submitted by parents and guardians of students in a given school district. 
This is a positive step, but it is not enough. 
Across the state, books continue to face challenges. Local communities must remain vigilant. At the same time, there is a national trend toward the normalization of censoring certain topics. Just four days after Donald Trump was inaugurated as the 47th President of the United States, the Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights issued a statement condemning “Biden’s Book Ban Hoax.” 
Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor said, “By dismissing these complaints and eliminating the position and authorities of a so-called ‘book ban coordinator,’ the department is beginning the process of restoring the fundamental rights of parents to direct their children’s education.”
The argument in defense of book bans, invoking parents’ rights, is common. Certainly, parental rights are a rhetorically powerful political argument. Yet, it does not hold. Political expression is a fundamental protection in the United States, as is freedom of speech. That right is for all, not some. Parental rights do not mean a parent of one child has the right to dictate what the child of another parent reads in their local public library. 
The issue of book banning has become of dire importance. Book bans privilege distinct ideological views while censoring and demonizing gender identity, sexual orientation, and the stories of marginalized groups. 
It is critical, now more than ever, that communities in Connecticut continue to protect diverse perspectives in their public libraries and schools. There are many ways to fight against book banning, and action is crucial at the local level. Vote in your local elections. Attend local school board meetings and local town halls. Report book bans to organizations like PEN America, the American Library Association, or the National Coalition Against Censorship. Most importantly, read banned books. Without these books, stories are lost.

Recent weeks have brought good news about vaccines, with studies indicating that flu vaccination reduces heart disease, shingles vaccines can prevent or slow dementia, and a single human papillomavirus shot protects a girl from cervical cancer for the rest of her life.
But in the upside-down world of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., vaccines are on the ropes. A vaccine committee dominated by skeptics he chose for the panel voted 8-to-3 Friday to end a 34-year recommendation to inoculate newborns against hepatitis B, a practice that helped reduce childhood infections of the virus by 99%, from around 16,000 in 1991 to only seven in 2023.
While the committee went about its deliberations, the peril of abandoning vaccines was plain to see. The country’s worst year since 1992 for measles — an entirely vaccine-preventable illness — continued with flare-ups in Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina. A two-year outbreak of whooping cough, which vaccines can also check, has caused about 60,000 reported cases — including at least six infant deaths.
But neither of those diseases was discussed on the first day of the meeting by members of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. The panel’s chartered purpose is to determine vaccination policies to counter such risks, but under Kennedy, it has focused on responding to doubts from vaccine skeptics and opponents.
Like previous gatherings of the committee, which was handpicked by Kennedy after he fired the panel’s 17 incumbent experts in June, the session was chaotically at odds with past practices of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Kennedy has described the agency as a “cesspool of corruption.”
The committee’s chair, epidemiologist Martin Kulldorff, left three days before the meeting and was named to a senior HHS position. His successor, Kirk Milhoan, a pediatric cardiologist who has claimed that the mRNA technology used to make covid vaccines is “the biggest threat to humanity,” was on a plane or in Asia for most of the meeting, leaving Vice Chair Robert Malone holding the reins. Malone opposes vaccine mandates and became a darling of the anti-vaccine movement when he told podcast host Joe Rogan in 2021 that Americans were “basically being hypnotized” into taking the covid vaccine.
Typically, slides and data for the panel’s meetings are posted on the CDC’s website several days beforehand. This time they weren’t posted at all.
The committee’s working group that studied hepatitis B vaccines did not include recognized hepatitis experts. When a few panel members expressed reservations during the ACIP meeting, CDC hepatitis specialist Adam Langer was brought in to answer questions. He frowned on the proposed changes.
Surprising choice of experts
At 8 a.m. Dec. 4, the CDC finally listed the names of the meeting’s presenters. Aaron Siri, one of Kennedy’s former lawyers and a strident legal foe of vaccination, was set to headline Friday’s discussion of the pediatric immunization schedule.
Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican and physician who cast a deciding vote for Kennedy to win confirmation to his job, said on the social platform X: “Aaron Siri is a trial attorney who makes his living suing vaccine manufacturers. He is presenting as if an expert on childhood vaccines. The ACIP is totally discredited. They are not protecting children.”
In replies to his post, some people demanded to know what Cassidy planned to do about it. While he has publicly criticized some of Kennedy’s moves on vaccines, the senator has made no visible effort to reverse them.
As the meeting began, Malone revealed that Vicky Pebsworth, a senior officer at the National Vaccine Information Center, a four-decade-old cornerstone of vaccine skepticism, was chairing a committee that is reviewing the entire childhood vaccine schedule. That’s the repository of ACIP recommendations that protect American children from measles, pertussis, influenza, tetanus, chickenpox, meningitis, and a host of other diseases.
Typically, seasoned CDC and FDA experts on vaccines and infectious disease present data about a disease and the options for its prevention before ACIP votes on a policy. Instead, Pebsworth, vaccine-skeptical climate scientist Cynthia Nevison, and businessperson Mark Blaxill, who helped lead another anti-vaccine group, presented the case — a negative one — on the hepatitis B vaccine on Dec. 4.
Sports medicine doctor Tracy Beth Høeg, who parlayed a year working with University of California-San Francisco epidemiologist Vinay Prasad, now the FDA’s vaccine chief, into a leading role at the agency, frequently chimed in. Nevison and Blaxill were co-authors of a 2021 autism study retracted for data misrepresentation and other problems.
Unsurprisingly, the picture they painted Dec. 4 suggested that the hepatitis B birth dose wasn’t necessary, and might be dangerous, notwithstanding years of scientific consensus to the contrary.
The presentations stunned Cody Meissner, an infectious disease specialist and one of the only vaccinologists on the CDC panel. “There were so many statements that I don’t agree with that it’s hard to be succinct,” he said.
Yvonne Maldonado, a Stanford University infectious disease specialist and one of the former ACIP members ejected in June, said she found it horrifying to watch unvetted presentations by nonexpert nonphysicians.
“Almost every statement made by this committee was misinformation, disinformation, or outright lies,” she said. “They are cherry-picking data, pulling up fringe papers, misunderstanding good papers. They are not the right people to be making decisions.”
Pebsworth said the committee was taking up the birth dose issue because of “pressure coming from stakeholder groups” — presumably including Kennedy and his allies. The U.S. is an “outlier” in its universal recommendation, she erroneously said.
In fact, the birth dose of the hepatitis B vaccine is given in 115 countries and is recommended by the World Health Organization. Many Western European countries limit the birth dose to targeted groups, however.
Arguments for the birth dose
Nevison said targeted measures to stop the virus in the 1980s, including promoting safer sex, increasing blood screening, and vaccinating the babies of hepatitis B-positive mothers, had achieved most of the reduction in cases since then. But most experts say the birth dose played a key role. And the virus remains a threat, with an estimated 640,000 carriers in the U.S.
The birth dose “is a safety net,” Meissner said. “It’s really for chronically infected mothers who for one reason or another do not get tested.”
“Where is the evidence of harm?” asked another panelist, psychiatrist Joseph Hibbeln.
In the years since the birth dose of hepatitis B vaccine was recommended, it has caused vanishingly few confirmed major side effects.
Blaxill, who 25 years ago helped advance the since-disproven theory that traces of mercury in vaccines were causing an epidemic of autism, said that hepatitis B vaccines were inadequately studied. He pointed to a study that showed high fevers in some children after the shot, which he said suggested brain inflammation.
Maldonado said that’s wrong. “I’ve seen thousands of children with fevers,” she said. “It’s not the same as encephalitis.”
Nevison said that a small number of vaccine court awards proved at least some harm by hepatitis B vaccinations. Reed Grimes, director of the Division of Injury Compensation Programs at the Health Resources and Services Administration, explained that an award does not necessarily signify proof of injury, but rather that the government decided not to contest a claim.
Speculation bloomed. Panelist Evelyn Griffin, an obstetrician, posited that rising cases of inflammatory bowel disease might be related to a medium — brewer’s yeast — used in the production of the hepatitis B vaccine. She did not cite a source for the idea.
Babies born with hepatitis B infections have a 90% chance of chronic liver infection later in life, and 25% of those with a chronic infection will die prematurely with chronic liver disease.
Panel members pushing to end the universal birth dose argued that blood tests of pregnant women should show who needs the shot. But only 35% of women who test positive receive all recommended follow-up care, and the virus can spread easily through contacts as common as a toothbrush or a bath towel. Ending the birth dose could result in nearly 500 deaths a year, according to a recent study.
The meeting was preceded by a heavy round of briefings for journalists and “prebunking” papers from established medical experts who view the new ACIP as a sounding board for anti-vaccine views — “inflating speculative risks while downplaying well-established vaccine benefits,” as three recent CDC officials wrote.
They noted that the hepatitis B birth dose is already optional, although doctors strongly recommend it. But recommending that it be a shared decision based on individual choice, as the ACIP voted Dec. 5, could add paperwork for doctors and introduce doubts in parents’ minds.
ACIP recommendations aren’t binding but have been used by health insurers in the past to establish coverage decisions. Federal agencies and private insurers will in most cases continue to pay for the hepatitis B vaccination if parents want it, said Andrew Johnson, who represented the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services during the meeting. But studies have shown that ambiguous advice leads to lower vaccination rates, said Kathryn Edwards, a Vanderbilt University vaccinologist.
Anti-vaccine activists have long targeted the hepatitis B birth dose. At one time they baselessly claimed it caused sudden infant death syndrome.
But within a decade of the universal dose implementation, the rate of SIDS had fallen by nearly half. That was thanks to an HHS-American Academy of Pediatrics’ “back to sleep” campaign, which urged parents to avoid suffocation risk by not letting their babies go to sleep on their stomachs.

(File photo by Bryan P. Sears/Maryland Matters)The next speaker of the House of Delegates will likely be a woman and immigrant.
Del. Joseline Peña-Melnyk (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel) appears to have a clear path within the Democratic Caucus to become the next speaker. A vote is scheduled for Dec. 16.
Three of the four leading candidates to succeed former Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) have bowed out — Appropriations Committee Chair Ben Barnes (D-Prince George’s and Anne Arundel), Economic Matters Committee Chair C.T. Wilson (D-Charles) and Legislative Black Caucus Chair Jheanelle Wilkins (D-Montgomery) — effectively clearing the field for Peña-Melnyk, Maryland Matters has learned.
“I am really honored and very moved that Chairman Barnes … Black Caucus Chair Wilkins and the chair of the Economic Matters Committee … C.T. Wilson, have decided to support my candidacy for speaker,” Peña-Melnyk said in a brief phone interview Sunday night.
“They have decided to withdraw their candidacy to allow me to move ahead. The vote is scheduled for the 16th [of December], and at that time, I will have the opportunity to make my case to the entire caucus,” she said. “As you know, there’s 102 members, and I hope to make my case and to be able to get their support. I’m very humbled and moved, and we’ll see what happens on the 16th.”
While it’s not official until the Dec. 16 vote, Barnes left little doubt Sunday about who the next speaker would be.
Jones steps down, ending historic era as House Speaker

“I’m 100% in support of our new speaker, Joseline Peña-Melnyk. She has the toughness, intelligence and grit to be a great speaker. I know she will be,” Barnes said. “I’m going to support her any way I can.”
Barnes, who represents the same district as Peña-Melnyk, said they came to the legislature together 20 years ago and he called her “a great friend” and “like a big sister to me. I can’t wait to get to work with her.”
Wilkins, in a phone call late Sunday, confirmed that she has withdrawn her candidacy and is supporting Peña-Melnyk.
Peña-Melnyk would become the second woman to lead a chamber of the Maryland General Assembly. She would also be the first person born in the Dominican Republic to lead either the House or Senate.
Her ascendance to the rostrum makes her the highest-ranking Afro-Latino in the history of the General Assembly.
Peña-Melnyk assumes the top House spot in the last year of a four-year term. She’ll immediately face a $1.5 billion budget deficit as well as a caucus anxious to pass midcycle congressional redistricting, despite opposition in the Senate.
She will have to guide the House as it considers overrides of vetoes issued by Gov. Wes Moore (D), including a bill on the creation of a reparations commission. Peña-Melnyk defended that bill on the floor of the House last year.
She also takes over amid growing worries among immigrants in Maryland and heightened enforcement by federal agents who are prosecuting President Donald Trump’s pledge to carry out mass arrests and deportations.
Peña-Melnyk succeeds Jones, who last week announced she would give up the position she was first elected to in 2019. Jones said she would remain in the House.
She did not give a reason for her decision. She also did not attend the meeting Thursday where her top lieutenants, the chairs of the House standing committees, were informed of her decision.
Jones’ announcement last week touched off a flurry of activity. A number of candidates expressed interest in the slot, with Barnes, Wilson and Peña-Melnyk considered the frontrunners.
Peña-Melnyk has been a member of the House since 2007. She became chair of the House Health and Government Operations Committee in 2022. Prior to that she served three years as the panel’s vice chair.
Peña-Melnyk, 59, was born in the Dominican Republic. She immigrated to the U.S. as a small child and grew up in New York, graduating from high school in the Bronx.
She earned her law degree from the University at Buffalo School of Law, State University of New York. She later worked as both a federal prosecutor and a public defender. She also worked as a child neglect lawyer.
She is the mother of three, including twins.
Her political career includes three years on the College Park City Council. She was elected to the House of Delegates in 2006.
During her time in the House she’s built a reputation as a major player on health care policy issues. During her time as vice chair of HGO she took on greater responsibility for running committee hearings and defending bills in recent years.
In 2016, she ran unsuccessfully for the 4th District congressional seat. She placed third, receiving 19% of the vote in the Democratic primary.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230322TorresPenaMelnyk01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-12-07 22:56:24.381164

StebbinsMichelle Lynn Kahn, University of Richmond

How can society police the global spread of online far-right extremism while still protecting free speech? That’s a question policymakers and watchdog organizations confronted as early as the 1980s and ’90s – and it hasn’t gone away.
Decades before artificial intelligence, Telegram and white nationalist Nick Fuentes’ livestreams, far-right extremists embraced the early days of home computing and the internet. These new technologies offered them a bastion of free speech and a global platform. They could share propaganda, spew hatred, incite violence and gain international followers like never before.
Before the digital era, far-right extremists radicalized each other primarily using print propaganda. They wrote their own newsletters and reprinted far-right tracts such as Adolf Hitler’s “Mein Kampf” and American neo-Nazi William Pierce’s “The Turner Diaries,” a dystopian work of fiction describing a race war. Then, they mailed this propaganda to supporters at home and abroad.
I’m a historian who studies neo-Nazis and far-right extremism. As my research shows, most of the neo-Nazi propaganda confiscated in Germany from the 1970s through the 1990s came from the United States. American neo-Nazis exploited their free speech under the First Amendment to bypass German censorship laws. German neo-Nazis then picked up this print propaganda and distributed it throughout the country.
This strategy wasn’t foolproof, however. Print propaganda could get lost in the mail or be confiscated, especially when crossing into Germany. Producing and shipping it was also expensive and time-consuming, and far-right organizations were chronically understaffed and strapped for cash.
 Going digital

Computers, which entered the mass market in 1977, promised to help resolve these problems. In 1981, Matt Koehl, head of the National Socialist White People’s Party in the United States, solicited donations to “Help the Party Enter The Computer Age.” The American neo-Nazi Harold Covington begged for a printer, scanner and “serious PC” that could run WordPerfect word processing software. “Our multifarious enemies already possess this technology,” he noted, referring to Jews and government officials.
Soon, far-right extremists figured out how to connect their computers to one another. They did so by using online bulletin board systems, or BBSes, a precursor to the internet. A BBS was hosted on a personal computer, and other computers could dial in to the BBS using a modem and a terminal software program, allowing users to exchange messages, documents and software.
With BBSes, anyone interested in accessing far-right propaganda could simply turn on their computer and dial in to an organization’s advertised phone number. Once connected, they could read the organization’s public posts, exchange messages and upload and download files.
The first far-right bulletin board system, the Aryan Nations Liberty Net, was established in 1984 by Louis Beam, a high-ranking member of the Ku Klux Klan and Aryan Nations. Beam explained: “Imagine, if you can, a single computer to which all leaders and strategists of the patriotic movement are connected. Imagine further that any patriot in the country is able to tap into this computer at will in order to reap the benefit of all accumulative knowledge and wisdom of the leaders. ‘Someday,’ you may say? How about today?”
Then came violent neo-Nazi computer games. Neo-Nazis in the United States and elsewhere could upload and download these games via bulletin board systems, copy them onto disks and distribute them widely, especially to schoolchildren.
In the German computer game KZ Manager, players role-played as a commandant in a Nazi concentration camp that murdered Jews, Sinti and Roma, and Turkish immigrants. An early 1990s poll revealed that 39% of Austrian high schoolers knew of such games and 22% had seen them.
 Arrival of the web

By the mid-1990s, with the introduction of the more user-friendly World Wide Web, bulletin boards fell out of favor. The first major racial hate website on the internet, Stormfront, was founded in 1995 by the American white supremacist Don Black. The civil rights organization Southern Poverty Law Center found that almost 100 murders were linked to Stormfront.
By 2000, the German government had discovered, and banned, over 300 German websites with right-wing content – a tenfold increase within just four years.
In response, American white supremacists again exploited their free speech rights to bypass German censorship bans. They gave international far-right extremists the opportunity to host their websites safely and anonymously on unregulated American servers – a strategy that continues today.
 Up next: AI

The next frontier for far-right extremists is AI. They are using AI tools to create targeted propaganda, manipulate images, audio and videos, and evade detection. The far-right social network Gab created a Hitler chatbot that users can talk to.
AI chatbots are also adopting the far-right views of social media users. Grok, the chatbot on Elon Musk’s X, recently called itself “MechaHitler,” spewed antisemitic hate speech and denied the Holocaust.
 Countering extremism

Combating online hate is a global imperative. It requires comprehensive international cooperation among governments, nongovernmental organizations, watchdog organizations, communities and tech corporations.
Far-right extremists have long pioneered innovative ways to exploit technological progress and free speech. Efforts to counter this radicalization are challenged to stay one step ahead of the far right’s technological advances.

(Photo illustration by Getty Images)The U.S. Supreme Court on Dec. 5, 2025, agreed to review the long-simmering controversy over birthright citizenship. It will likely hand down a ruling next summer.
In January 2025, President Donald Trump issued an executive order removing the recognition of citizenship for the U.S.-born children of both immigrants here illegally and visitors here only temporarily. The new rule is not retroactive. This change in long-standing U.S. policy sparked a wave of litigation culminating in Trump v. Washington, an appeal by Trump to remove the injunction put in place by federal courts.
When the justices weigh the arguments, they will focus on the meaning of the first sentence of the 14th Amendment, known as the citizenship clause: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”
Both sides agree that to be granted birthright citizenship under the Constitution, a child must be born inside U.S. borders and the parents must be “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. However, each side will give a very different interpretation of what the second requirement means. Who falls under “the jurisdiction” of the United States in this context?
As a close observer of the court, I anticipate a divided outcome grounded in strong arguments from each side.
Arguments for automatic citizenship
Simply put, the argument against the Trump administration is that the 14th Amendment’s expansion of citizenship after the eradication of slavery was meant to be broad rather than narrow, encompassing not only formerly enslaved Black people but all persons who arrived on U.S. soil under the protection of the Constitution.
The Civil War amendments – the 13th, 14th and 15th – established inherent equality as a constitutional value, which embraced all persons born in the nation without reference to race, ethnicity or origin.
One of the strongest arguments that automatic citizenship is the meaning of the Constitution is long-standing practice. Citizenship by birth regardless of parental status – with few exceptions – has been the effective rule since the time of America’s founding.
Advocates also point to precedent: the landmark case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark in 1898. When an American-born descendant of resident noncitizens sued after being refused re-entry to San Francisco under the Chinese Exclusion Act, the court recognized his natural-born citizenship.
If we read the Constitution in a living fashion – emphasizing the evolution of American beliefs and values over time – the constitutional commitment to broad citizenship grounded in equality, regardless of ethnicity or economic status, seems even more clear.
However, advocates must try to convince the court’s originalists – Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett – who read the Constitution based on its meaning when it was adopted.
The originalist argument in favor of birthright citizenship is that the phrase “subject to the jurisdiction” was meant to invoke only a small set of exceptions found in traditional British common law. In the Wong Kim Ark ruling, the court relied on this “customary law of England, brought to America by the colonists.”
One exception to birthright citizenship covered by this line of rulings is the child of a foreign diplomat, whose parents represent the interests of another country. Another exception is the children of invading foreign armies. A third exception discussed explicitly by the framers of the 14th Amendment was Native Americans, who at the time were understood to be under the jurisdiction of their tribal government as a separate sovereign. That category of exclusion faded away after Congress recognized the citizenship of Native Americans in 1924.
The advocates of automatic birthright citizenship conclude that whether the 14th Amendment is interpreted in a living or in an original way, its small set of exceptions do not override its broad message of citizenship grounded in human equality.
Opposition to birthright citizenship
The opposing argument begins with a simple intuition: In a society defined by self-government, as America is, there is no such thing as citizenship without consent. In the same way that an American citizen cannot declare himself a French citizen and vote in French elections without consent from the French government, a foreign national cannot declare himself a U.S. citizen without consent.
This argument emphasizes that citizenship in a democracy means holding equal political power over our collective decisions. That is something only existing citizens hold the right to offer to others, something which must be decided through elections and the lawmaking process.
The court’s ruling in Elk v. Wilkins in 1884 – just 16 years after the ratification of the 14th Amendment – endorses “the principle that no one can become a citizen of a nation without its consent.” By making entry into the United States without approval a federal offense, Congress has effectively denied that consent.
Scholars who support this view argue that the 14th Amendment does not provide this consent. Instead it sets a limitation. To the authors of the 14th Amendment, “subject to the jurisdiction thereof” conveyed a limit to natural citizenship grounded in mutual allegiance. That means if people are free to deny their old national allegiance, and an independent nation is free to decide its own membership, the recognition of a new national identity must be mutual.
Immigrants living in the United States illegally have not accepted the sovereignty of the nation’s laws. On the other side of the coin, the government has not officially accepted them as residents under its protection.
President Donald Trump speaks on recent Supreme Court rulings in the briefing room at the White House on June 27, 2025. The Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that individual judges cannot grant nationwide injunctions to block executive orders, including the injunction on Trump’s effort to eliminate birthright citizenship in the U.S. The justices did not rule on Trump’s order to end birthright citizenship but stopped his order from taking effect for 30 days.

If mutual recognition of allegiance is the meaning of the 14th Amendment, the Trump administration has not violated it.
The opponents of birthright citizenship argue that the Wong Kim Ark ruling has been misrepresented. In that case, the court only considered permanent legal residents like Wong Kim Ark’s parents, but not residents here illegally or temporarily. The focus on British common law in that ruling is simply misguided because the findings of Calvin’s Case or any other precedents dealing with British subjects were voided by the American Revolution.
In this view, the Declaration of Independence replaced subjects with citizens. The power to determine national membership was taken away from kings and placed in the hands of democratic majorities.
For opponents of birthright citizenship, the 14th Amendment does not take that power away from citizens but instead codifies the rule that mutual consent is the touchstone of admission. The requirement to be “subject to the jurisdiction” provides the mechanism of that consent.
Congress can determine who is accepted as a member of the national community under its jurisdiction. In this view, Congress – and the American people – have spoken: Current federal laws make entry into U.S. borders without permission a crime rather than a forced acceptance of political membership.
What might happen
The court will likely announce a ruling in summer 2026 before early July, just in time for the 250th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. The court will ultimately decide whether the Constitution endorses the declaration’s invocation of essential equality or its creation of a sovereign people empowered to determine the boundaries of national membership.
The court’s three Democratic-appointed justices – Ketanji Brown Jackson, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor – will surely side against the Trump administration. The six Republican-appointed justices seem likely to divide, a symptom of disagreements within the originalist camp.
The liberal justices need at least two of the conservatives to join them to form a majority of five to uphold universal birthright citizenship. This will likely be some combination of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett.
The Trump administration will prevail only if five out of the six conservatives reject the British common law foundations of the Wong Kim Ark ruling in favor of citizenship by consent alone.
America should know by July Fourth.

(Getty Images)Nothing in Gov. Joe Lombardo’s proclamation calling a legislative special session last month gave “special” attention to the economic pressures and aggravations Nevadans are trying to deal with right now.
Uninspired leadership, perhaps. But it also reflects a default presumption that whatever financial pains are being suffered in Nevada households, there isn’t really much Nevada state government can do about it.
What Lombardo fondly calls the “Nevada way” is laced with surrenderism.
For starters…
In an October poll, Nevada respondents blamed the Las Vegas tourism slump on the destination being too expensive.
That’s a convenient poll result for the Republican governor and many Democrats seeking election to statewide office. If the economy is the industry’s fault, then it’s up to the industry, not state elected officials, to fix it, so neener neener, they’re off the hook.
The industry’s not going to fix the Las Vegas economy for the same reason it’s — at least in part — responsible for breaking it: The Las Vegas casino-hotel industry’s commitment to customers pales in comparison to its commitment to shareholders.
But it’s mistaken to assume dire area economic conditions are unique to Las Vegas or the tourism industry. The marketplace is becoming more aggravating, infuriating, and expensive in nearly every economic sector, not just in Nevada but nationwide.
Nevada’s prosperity and lack thereof is infamous for its dependence on the national economy. That’s another convenience for state-level elected officials. They’re not in charge of the national economy. And Nevada’s state government is deliberately built to to prevent passage of economic policy unless it’s focused on providing assistance to business. So nobody expects state elected officials to do much if anything about daily financial pressures crushing their constituents.
There are of course a lot of state-level policy initiatives and reforms that would improve the financial wherewithal of working households in Nevada: lower the state’s high insurance tax and sales tax rates; provide working families with state-level tax rebates and child tax credits; fund public transit to liberate people from the cost of cars (one of the highest households expenses behind housing); fund child care (one of the other highest household expenses); pay for all those things and other long-neglected Nevada services and programs A) with a billionaire tax, and B) by raising taxes on a gambling industry that currently spends more on stock buybacks to enrich shareholders the world over than it pays in state gaming taxes; cap rent increases (to be fair, state legislative Democrats have taken modest swings at that); enact laws assuring paid leave; raise the pathetically low minimum wage.
Those are just for starters.
It could get worse before it gets better
The most recently reported inflation rate was the same as it was when Trump was inaugurated, 3%, according to the September consumer price index report. (Due to the government shutdown, no CPI report was released for October; the November inflation report is scheduled to be released Dec. 18.)
As painful as continuously rising prices are, Trump’s policies stoked fears that inflation would be even worse than it has been, especially after he launched his global war on trade in April.
Worse could still be in the cards.
The Peterson Institute for International Economics released a paper more than a year ago, before Trump was elected, which attempted to model economic impacts of tariffs, deportation of immigrants, and revoking the Federal Reserve Board’s independence.
Under the models, inflation and unemployment were projected to begin rising significantly — but not until at least about a year after Trump’s policies went into effect.
“None of us expected it to be immediate,” the Peterson Institute’s president, Adam Posen, told a Financial Times podcast this week.
If you were among business executives reacting to tariffs, you “had to make very difficult decisions about your supply chains,” Posen said. “Even if you’re Toyota or Caterpillar or somebody incredibly sophisticated like that, it’s still difficult to decide ‘okay, given the tariffs, what stuff do we bring home, what stuff do we put in Mexico versus China, where are our alternative suppliers, who do we use, what do we invest in the U.S.?’ And if that’s true for these companies, just imagine what it’s like … for all the middle-sized companies.”
“So there were a lot of good reasons to think that the tariffs are going to take a while to take effect,” Posen said.
Though acknowledging his is not a consensus view, Posen said he expects “inflation is going to be significantly higher than the current forecasts by a year from now, probably by the third quarter of 2026.”
The Peterson Institute is considered one of the world’s better think tanks, and especially among those with an economics focus.
That doesn’t mean Posen’s right.
And by his own admission his view isn’t aligned with other mainstream forecasts, which see the inflation rate (but not prices) beginning to decline next year.
But Posen’s forecast appears to be somewhat in sync with the wisdom of crowds. Though improving slightly this month, consumer sentiment remains dramatically down from what it was a year ago, and consumers expect inflation to go higher than it is now, both short-term and long-term.
Direct, indirect, and maybe some day
Those who place an outsized faith in the goodness of market forces — a club to which most Nevada politicians of both parties belong — assume inflation will eventually stop freaking everybody out and the economy will become more hospitable, eventually. Everybody just has to soldier on and wait it out.
In another convenient turn for Nevada politicians, that assumption dovetails with the conventionally held (if rarely publicly articulated) view that Nevada is powerless to do anything of much consequence to improve the day-to-day economic wherewithal of its residents.
Next year is a campaign year. Polling in Nevada, as nationwide, consistently finds the economy is far and away the top concern of voters.
Voters should keep an eye out to see which Nevada candidates outline specific proposals designed to address the financial stability of Nevada households directly, and which candidates trot out the fundamental premise of the “Nevada way,” i.e., help powerful industries and wait patiently for prosperity to ripple out to everyone else.
And voters should also watch to see which candidates, when asked about economic pressures facing households, claim impotence, recite a platitude, and change the subject.

There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org.
It’s becoming more common for South Dakotans to kill themselves with a gun, according to new data. 
The number of South Dakotans who took their own lives with a firearm rose to 116 last year, and the proportion of South Dakota suicides involving a gun rose to 59%, according to the state Department of Health. The state’s gun-suicide rate rose to 12.6 per 100,000 people. All three numbers are the highest in recent years’ data for the state.
Suicide prevention workers say the numbers underscore the need for real-life connection and safe gun storage in a state where firearm ownership is common and legal gun restrictions are minimal.
Sioux Falls Police Chief John Thum cautioned against attributing the trends to a single cause, because local investigations encounter factors ranging from terminal illness to relationship struggles, chronic depression and substance use. 
But access and lethality also matter.
“There’s a definite sense of finality to a gunshot attempt,” Thum said. “If we look at some of the other suicide attempts that we have — overdose, and some of the other ones — the level of absolutism to a firearm is there.” 
Gun laws and lawmaking in Pierre
According to estimates by the RAND Corporation, a nonprofit policy think tank, more than half of adults in South Dakota live in a household with a firearm. A separate analysis by KFF, a nonprofit health policy research group, shows South Dakota has some of the loosest gun restrictions in the country, and “more than twice as many suicides by firearm occur in states with the fewest gun laws, relative to states with the most laws.”
South Dakota requires no permit or background check for private gun sales, allows for the carrying of concealed pistols without a permit, allows concealed pistols in bars and on public college campuses, allows concealed pistols in the state Capitol with prior approval and notification, does not have a firearm registration system, and lacks a “red flag law,” which in other states allows temporary firearm removals from people in crisis.
Democratic former state lawmaker Linda Duba, of Sioux Falls, unsuccessfully proposed what she described as two “modest firearm safety bills” during the 2024 legislative session. She said one of her goals was to lower firearm suicides in the state.
One bill would have required gun owners to report lost or stolen firearms. The other would have required firearms not in use to be locked away with a gun lock or in a safe. Duba said she had seen research that locked-up firearms were less likely to be used in a suicide. 
Duba said some Republican legislators privately supported the measures, but refused to back them publicly because they feared political retaliation from the National Rifle Association. She said the association makes it impossible to convince Republican legislators to support “even the most reasonable regulations.”
“It’s going to take someone being personally impacted before they wake up,” Duba said.
Rep. Tim Reisch, R-Howard, is a retired sheriff, former state Department of Corrections secretary and a member of the National Guard. He was one of a handful of Republican lawmakers earlier this year to vote against the legislation that now allows for the carrying of concealed pistols on technical college and public university campuses. He said many Republicans in Pierre fear negative campaign postcards from the National Rifle Association showing up in their constituents’ mailboxes.
“Nobody wants a ‘D,’ ‘C,’ or even a ‘B’ grade,” from the NRA, Reisch said. “These scorecards are ridiculous. It’s one person’s opinion. But in the end, come election season, sound bites matter. It’s ‘Reisch is soft on crime.’ And those things weigh heavily in the minds of some legislators who really want to keep getting elected.”  
Gun suicides in US reached record high in 2023

Former state trooper Rep. Jim Halverson, R-Winner, also voted against the bill allowing concealed pistols on campus.
“I’m a Second Amendment lover, I really am,” he said. “I just believe there are places where it’s not a good idea.”
Halverson said college is a place where students may experience their first big failure, first major breakup, and first experiences with drugs and alcohol. All of that, and being away from the support of family at home, makes for an environment where suicides could become more likely, he said. 
Halverson said “unless these people have seen somebody who’s been shot themselves, seen someone who has taken their life, they don’t get it.”
“They haven’t had to go pick up a body,” he said. “Or go to somebody’s house and say, ‘Your son or daughter is not coming home tonight.’”
Retired law enforcement officer Rep. Kevin Van Diepen, R-Huron, voted in favor of the pistols-on-campus bill. He said it was a Second Amendment issue, and it would have been unconstitutional to restrict students’ rights. 
Van Diepen said suicide “is a mental health issue.” 
“If they didn’t have a gun, they would use some other means,” he said. 
Storage, loneliness and stigma
Lost & Found is a Sioux Falls-based suicide prevention nonprofit. Researcher Cody Ingle said suicide is not always linked to mental illness. Sometimes it’s an impulsive decision brought on by stress or crisis. He said things like gun locks can be the difference between people pulling the trigger in the heat of the moment, and just a few more breaths that can save their life. 
“We’ve had individuals come up to us and say, ‘This gun lock saved my life,’” Ingle said. “We’re not saying guns are bad, but creating time and space between someone in a difficult headspace and a firearm can save lives.”
Safe gun storage, according to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, includes locking up guns in a safe with a trigger lock and keeping ammunition separately stored. Keys and codes should be secured.










They haven’t had to go pick up a body. Or go to somebody’s house and say, ‘Your son or daughter is not coming home tonight.’


– Rep. Jim Halverson, R-Winner


Loneliness and isolation — which the U.S. surgeon general declared a public health crisis in 2023 — is also playing a role in the gun suicide trend, said Carrie Jorgensen, executive director of Lost & Found. 
“People are not connecting like they used to,” she said. “And in the online, virtual space, it’s not the same. You can still feel incredibly lonely, even if you have 10 conversations happening at the same time.” 
She said stigma around mental health remains strong in South Dakota, where cultural norms can discourage seeking help, particularly among men. 
“That idea of ‘pull yourself up by your bootstraps, just grin and bear it,’ continues to exist, especially within that population,” Jorgensen said. 
The male suicide death rate in the U.S. is about four times higher than the female rate, and 57% of male suicides in South Dakota from 2015 to 2024 involved a firearm, according to the state Department of Health. 
Jorgensen advised South Dakotans to take the time to maintain real-life friendships and a sense of community, and not to be too proud to ask for help from friends, family or suicide prevention and mental health professionals.

(Photo courtesy of Emma Yerkey)As farmers face historic headwinds and market hardships, calls to the national Farm Aid hotline and the Iowa Concern hotline — where farmers can get support in times of mental health crisis or need — are increasing.
This fall, the Iowa Concern hotline saw four to five times the number of calls it had in the same months last year, said Tammy Jacobs, the hotline’s manager.
The Farm Aid hotline is also seeing a change in the urgency of calls.
“We’re seeing more established farmers calling in — people who know how to play the game and how to access programs. They’re calling more often now, because even with all that institutional knowledge, they’re still running into issues for the first time that are more complex and difficult to solve,” said Lori Mercer, a Farm Aid hotline operator. “The system that’s in place is simply letting them down. There’s just no further safety net.” 
Research shows farmers die by suicide at least twice as often as people in the general population, so there’s urgency to address the uptick in need. 
“It’s a huge issue. I mean, we’ve known at least three families this year whose loved ones died by suicide,” said Emma Yerkey, who’s part of the Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a monthly meetup for ag producers around the Quad-Cities to talk about their struggles.
Farmers experience a lot of stressors and uncertainty that they can’t control — isolation, weather changes, and financial pressures — along with low access to mental health care in rural areas and stigma that may make them keep their pain to themselves. Market conditions made worse by a trade war and inflation are adding to the stress. Mental health professionals are thinking outside the box to get producers care. 
Understanding the stress
Yerkey’s family farms corn, soybeans, and hay in Geneseo, Illinois, on land they’ve owned since the Civil War. The farm is filled with memories, especially of her dad, Tim Yerkey.

She played baseball with him in their driveway, the family ate meals together in the home, and, one year, her father helped her raise a ribbon-winning calf. 
“That was a really good memory that I have with him,” Yerkey said.
But the farm could be stressful, too. Tim Yerkey worked the land with his family, but at times had to take outside jobs to make ends meet. In 2011, he’d been struggling for about a year when spring floods left fields underwater. He’d reached out to friends and visited the emergency room seeking help, only to be told there were no beds, Yerkey said. He died by suicide in June 2011. 
“I miss my dad, and I don’t want anybody else — or any other family — to go through that,” Yerkey said.
But many farming families experience similar pain. Between 2003 and 2017, more than 1600 farmers died by suicide, the majority older white men.  
Experts say factors that contribute to stress and higher suicide rates among farmers include isolation, easy access to guns, a cultural expectation of toughness, stigma around seeking mental health care, worries about who will take over the farm, and a lack of recognition for their hard work.
Financial losses and stress are also significant risks for depressive symptoms. And right now, times are tough for farmers. 
Producers have endured high inflation and growing input costs on farms since at least 2020. The spread of COVID and, more recently, policy decisions like President Donald Trump’s tariffs and increases in immigration enforcement have all increased operating costs. At the same time, prices for major commodities are low — lower than the cost to grow them. Corn prices are about $0.85 below the break even point and soybeans are about $2 below. 
This year, many states are expecting a record corn crop, but farmers aren’t celebrating.
“It’s very discouraging for farmers to think that they’ve done all the things right in their fields and have put innovations in place and made good decisions, but yet, even with strong yields, they’re gonna be facing a loss on what they’re producing,” said Aaron Lehman, president of the Iowa Farmers Union.
In 2024, the U.S. exported about 42% of its soybeans, most of it to China. With China not buying in the midst of the trade war, some farmers who usually send their crop abroad have struggled to find new markets. The U.S. in November struck a new deal with China, potentially extending a lifeline to producers still scrambling to move their harvest, but it remains to be seen what China will actually buy.
Some programs that helped connect farmers to domestic markets, like the Local Food Purchase Assistance initiative, have also been cut by the USDA. 
“Since the beginning of the year, the farmers have just been thrown into a different level of uncertainty with policy things like losing access to some markets through tariffs, losing access to staff and programming with the government shutdown, and the funding freezes. A big one we’re hearing about is losing access to labor with the ICE raids, etcetera,” said Mercer, with Farm Aid. “I was just speaking to a farmer the other day who was basically watching his crops rot on the vines because his usual labor support was just too afraid to show up this year.” 
In addition to all of the financial stress, farmers say they feel the work can be thankless. 
“This work is incredibly hard, and nobody understands where their food comes from. Nobody knows that [farmers] work 20 hours a day so that they can have a strawberry,” said Anna Scheyett, a retired professor of social work who studied farmer stress and suicide at the University of Georgia.
Meeting farmers where they are
Despite the many struggles, some families are finding hope and community in turbulent times. To honor her dad, Yerkey joined the new Ag Chapter of Gray Matters, a Quad-Cities nonprofit that provides mental health resources, education, and safe spaces.

Gray Matters hosts monthly Barn Talks, where participants can share what’s weighing on them, whether it’s stress, depression, anxiety, or other struggles, and receive support from others. The organizers hope to build a sense of community and normalize talking about mental health. 
“Feeling comfortable and safe to say that — ‘Hey, I am stressed out, or I am really hurting right now. Maybe I am depressed, maybe I have some anxiety,’ — whatever it might be,” said Heather Gritton, one of the group leaders.
Offering spaces where farmers can meet and take some of that load off their shoulders can help break down the stigma around getting help, said Sara Kohlbeck, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at the Medical College of Wisconsin. 
It’s key for those spaces to be easily accessible to farmers. 
“Bringing that support to the farmers — or to the rural communities — rather than expecting those folks to come and get those resources for themselves is really important,” Kohlbeck said. “Otherwise, you know, we’ve got folks that are kind of suffering in silence because they just don’t have the time. Sometimes there’s stigma, and there’s kind of that pride issue.” 
There are also practical barriers. Telehealth isn’t a viable option for many farmers, as cell and internet reception in rural areas are limited. Driving long distances to see a counselor can also be impractical, especially during the busy harvest season. 
Another approach to reaching farmers has been to train people who farmers trust and regularly interact with — such as suppliers, lenders, large animal veterinarians, and spouses — to recognize when someone may be dealing with mental health challenges and teach them how to support them and direct them to resources. 
For example, Scheyett has trained agricultural lenders to recognize warning signs of suicide ideation and taught them how to respond. She’s also trained extension agents to take a few minutes at the beginning of agricultural production meetings to talk about stress and offer resources, something she says can make a real difference for farmers.
In one study, Scheyett and her co-authors found that farmers who were present at meetings where about 10 minutes were dedicated to talking about stress management walked away with new ideas for managing stress and a higher level of commitment to doing it. 
Sometimes, offering practical and logistical solutions to big problems can be a part of mental health services, too. 
“If a farmer has not really looked and done a deep dive into their farm financial system, we have a program that’s called farm financial associates, and they’ll come out to the farm, do a big evaluation over the farming operation to see where the hard points are and is there a way to switch things around, diversify, in order to help offset some of the farming losses and costs,” Jacobs, with the Iowa Concern hotline, said.

Where to call
Farmers can reach out to the 988 Lifeline or 1-800-FARM-AID for help. Help is also available in Spanish.
The Iowa Concern hotline is available 24/7 via chat, email, call, or text at 800-447-1985.

For farmers facing grain storage challenges, Jacobs suggested partnering with other farmers as an alternative to traditional co-op arrangements.
Scheyett suggests everybody can help by thanking farmers the same way we do with the military.
“Every time I see a farmer, I say thank you — thank you for your service, because what you do keeps us healthy, fed, and clothed,” Scheyett said.
It’s all in the hopes of providing care and saving lives.
“Even if you can save one life, I mean, that’s so worth it,” Yerkey said. “I feel very passionate about it.”

As a volunteer for The Vermont Afghan Alliance, I have gotten to know many of the recent Afghan arrivals here in Burlington and Montpelier.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Barbara Benton: Do not judge an entire group of people based on the actions of one individual.","This commentary is by Barbara Benton. She is a licensed clinical mental health counselor in Burlington, as well as a volunteer for the Vermont Afghan Alliance and other local organizations. 
In light of the recent violence in Washington, D.C. and the heightened anti-immigrant sentiment being promoted at the highest levels of this country, I want to reflect to Vermonters some of my experiences with the Afghans I have come to know.
My association with Afghanistan started about 16 years ago when I hosted a 16-year-old Afghan teenager in my home for almost a full year. He had received a scholarship from the U.S. government to study for one academic year in the U.S.
Despite propaganda to the contrary, his family hoped and trusted that he would be treated well in the US. I came to know him as one of the kindest and most thoughtful human beings I have met, and also came to truly understand that he was this way because his family valued those qualities, no less than I and my family did.
How enlightening to me that my family and his shared these values, despite differences in culture, customs and religion. And no surprise to me at all that his family and mine wanted their kids to be safe and cared for. He was eventually able to return to the U.S. on a student visa.
Today he lives in another state and was so proud to become a U.S. citizen. I consider him to be a part of my family and know him to still be the kind and thoughtful person I met half his life ago.
As a volunteer for The Vermont Afghan Alliance, I have gotten to know many of the recent Afghan arrivals here in Burlington and Montpelier. What I see is that they also, while being a diverse group of human beings, care about others and are so appreciative of the opportunity to work and live, and become a part of the social fabric here in the US.
Personal connections with Americans who care about their well-being, even a smile from a stranger, help so much in the process of welcoming newcomers and helping them integrate into our community. 
So please do not be inclined to judge an entire group of people based on the actions of one apparently troubled individual. Remember that we can share values of kindness and inclusion across cultures and diverse lifestyles.
And, were they to be returned to Afghanistan, they would face persecution and death because of their loyalty to the U.S.
Please stand with the Vermont Afghan Alliance, with me and with our Afghan allies as we continue to welcome them as valued members of our community. Let Vermont set the right tone in this time when some would try to tear us apart from each other and from our own humanity.

For some legislative supporters of providing public funds to private schools, the conditions being demanded by those private schools are OK. At least that seems to be the message, based on recent hearings at the Mississippi Capitol in advance of the 2026 legislative session.
“I don’t want to force our Christian schools to teach secular curriculum,” Rep. Jansen Owen, a Pearl River County Republican and co-chair of a House school choice select committee, said after an October meeting with the Mid-South Association of Independent Schools. ”I don’t want the state’s involvement to infringe on that in any way.”
Sure, it is highly likely many Mississippi legislators would support spending public funds on the teaching of “Christian values” and even campaign on that expenditure in their next election.
But what if the school receiving public funds was teaching Muslim values or Hindu values or Wiccan values?
What if the school accepted students only if they would pledge allegiance to the Prophet Muhammad?

Would it be OK with Mississippi politicians if the school taught tolerance and respect for LGBTQ people? What if the school allowed boys and girls to compete against each other in sports?
Would they support public funds going to those private schools?
Mississippi has a law preventing public schools from teaching diversity, equity and inclusion. Private schools are free to teach a DEI curriculum because they are, duh, private. But what if the private school teaching DEI was receiving public funds through vouchers, tax credits or some other scheme?
Many politicians also do not like the teaching of what is known as critical race theory or in general terms instruction on the impact of race on what happened in the past and what is occurring now. What if a private school wanted to construct its curriculum around the teaching of critical race theory? Would that be OK with Mississippi politicians who support providing vouchers to private schools?
Surely it would be.
After all, Mississippi politicians are known for their open mindedness. Look up the phrase open mindedness in Webster’s, and there is a photo of the Mississippi Legislature.
But such is not the case in Florida.
According to an article on the website of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, many Florida school choice supporters are concerned that Muslim schools are receiving public funds.
The article quotes Florida Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, the former president of the state Senate, explaining that schools “‘that indoctrinate Sharia law should not be a part of our taxpayer-funded school voucher program.’”
Many Mississippi school choice proponents argue that the private schools receiving public funds should not be required to face the same oversight and rules and regulations of public schools.
When state Auditor Shad White, whose job is to provide accountability of the spending of public funds, was asked back in March whether private schools receiving public funds should be subject to governmental oversight, he said, “They are held accountable by the parents who choose to send their kids there.” 
So, if the private schools receiving those public funds want to teach “Sharia law” or the virtues of LGBTQ rights and the parents do not object, is that OK with politicians like Auditor White, House Speaker Jason White and Gov. Tate Reeves who all support passing a school choice bill during the upcoming 2026 legislative session?
If so, they are indeed open minded. We just didn’t know.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/15220206/State-Capitol-2.jpg,,,2025-12-07 07:56:15.927891

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont’s ‘crack climbing mecca’ deep in the Northeast Kingdom gains popularity.","Deep in the Northeast Kingdom lie the Kingdom Heritage Lands, 132,000 acres of former and current timberland conserved for public access since 1998. The remote and undeveloped area is mainly the domain of wildlife, logging trucks, hunters and snowmobilers.
Recently, however, increasing numbers of rock climbers have frequented a stunning band of chiseled granite towers set in the middle of the Kingdom Heritage Lands, at a cliff 30 minutes south of the Canadian border and on the northern edge of the Nulhegan basin.

“As soon as you reach the cliff, your jaw drops,” Mischa Tourin, executive director of the Climbing Resource Access Group of Vermont — or CRAG-VT — said last week. “It all is perfect 90-degree angles, like it was built by rock climbers with rock climbing in mind.”
Climbers first explored the cliff, known as Black Mountain (not to be mistaken for Black Mountain Natural Area in Dummerston), around 2005, but only visited it sporadically until it was added to the second edition of Vermont’s comprehensive outdoor climbing guidebook, “Vermont Rock,” in 2022.
Alongside the subsequent increase in use of the cliff, the nonprofit CRAG-VT has spent the past few years working with landowners and easement-holders to preserve access, including creating a climbing management plan and establishing rock climbing as an “acceptable form of recreation” on the Kingdom Heritage Lands.
As part of that effort, six weeks of trail work on the area’s rugged and steep approach trail have been completed over the last two years by NorthWoods Stewardship Center, with significant funding from the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation.
According to Tourin, outdoor rock climbing in Vermont was, for a long time, defined by the schist that runs along the spine of the Green Mountains — a unique rock covered with tiny impressions, used by rock climbers as “holds.” In contrast, Black Mountain is made up of strong granite covered in “perfect” parallel cracks of varying sizes, Tourin said, which geologically has more in common with the White Mountains of New Hampshire or world-class climbing areas like Yosemite.

Those cracks, Tourin said, are very conducive to “traditional” climbing, where participants jam their hands and feet into the crack to move upward and place expansion gear — attached to a rope — in the cracks to catch a fall or help facilitate a descent.
“I think I feel comfortable saying that (Black Mountain) is the best place in the Northeast for crack climbing, as far as the number of crack climbs in one cliff,” the longtime climber and guide said. About 70 different routes have been established at the area, most of them of moderate or advanced difficulty.
However, reaching “Vermont’s premiere crack climbing mecca” can be quite the trek.
Black Mountain is located about a three-hour drive from Burlington, on the edge of Averill (population 21) and Lewis (population 0). Following a GPS will likely lead to a dead end, and a high-clearance vehicle is recommended.
The cliff is even a sizable distance from the Northeast Kingdom towns of St. Johnsbury (one hour and 30 minutes) or Newport (one hour), since users generally drive all the way up to the Canadian border in Norton before traveling 6.2 miles south on a slow, rocky power-line access road to reach Black Mountain’s parking area.
“It’s definitely far away,” Tourin said. “The last few times I’ve been there, it certainly seems like more folks in Canada have noticed that it’s a pretty good climbing resource because it’s only a couple miles south of the border.”
Before CRAG-VT’s involvement, the ordeal to reach the base of the cliff didn’t stop at the parking area. Up until a couple of years ago, visitors had to try and locate the access trail, which was steep, prone to erosion, often muddy and lined with prickly plants that latched onto any nearby pants leg.
As of last month, however, trail workers have fully established a sustainable approach trail that includes a welcome kiosk, 38 stone steps, four wooden ladders and 160 feet of retaining wall, a recent CRAG-VT newsletter explained.

“Next phases will continue base-of-cliff stabilization, assess more complex gully issues, and explore parking improvements,” the newsletter read. “This work moves us closer to a fully sustainable Black Mountain for years to come.”
According to Tourin, CRAG-VT’s work lies not only in securing access to climbing and stewarding cliffs but also in building community. To that end, the group held weekend member meetups titled Kingdom Climbing Weekend this year and last, renting out cottages at Quimby Country resort in Averill.
“We started it off maybe as a one-time thing to celebrate the start of (CRAG-VT’s) corridor manager agreement,” said Tourin, adding that most of those 40 participants wanted to return the next year to what he described as a “magical little family camp” on a lake.
“It’s a pretty great event and a pretty cool way to bring, I think, a little bit of money into the local community there,” he said.
While the remoteness of Black Mountain can be a draw, Tourin said it’s hard to gauge the future of the climbing area due to its location.
“It’s an amazing cliff,” he said. “I don’t know if it will ever be super crowded, just because it’s so far tucked away in the corner of the state, but it’s definitely a resource worth traveling to.”

This story by Liberty Darr was fist published in the Other Paper on Dec. 4, 2025.
Raymond and Elsie Whitney take good care of the lawn outside of their South Burlington home. In the summer months, it is alive with a blossoming display of zinnias and in the winter months, steadily manicured until the first snowfall, but through it all, a giant 50-foot Colorado Blue Spruce has remained a key marker to the home built in 1986.
But now, just a stump remains of what was once that “magnificent specimen.”
The couple, after several years of being pleaded with, decided to donate their tree for display on Church Street in Burlington during the holiday season this year. But for the couple, the donation holds a much greater mission than just greeting Church Street goers with some holiday cheer.
“Elsie has been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease,” Raymond said, looking at his wife sitting next to him in their kitchen. “It seemed like a good time, because we wanted to not only just light up Church Street, we wanted to shine a light on Alzheimer’s disease too.”
The Whitney’s built their house and moved into it on Halloween night in 1986. As Raymond recalls, they were one of the first few settlers in the area that is now a sprawling development with several neighboring homes.
Just a few days later that same year, Raymond made the trek up to South Hero to buy a sapling, which, in just under four decades, would grow into the giant that they came to love. At the time, though, it stood only about five feet tall, Raymond said, pointing to an old photo of their home with the tree out front.
“Every single thing on this property, I put on it, every blade of grass, every plant and I plant this place stuffed with flowers,” Raymond said.
And every year, for at least the past few, the couple has been greeted by the Church Street Marketplace crew, asking if they would be open to donating their tree for the lighting ceremony. But every year, Raymond would quip about the birds having paid their rent for the year.
And in a sense, that sentiment is true. For the years that have followed, the tree has been home to birds and squirrels, which have been quite the pest for the couple in recent years. And as the couple has grown older, maintenance has become more and more tiresome, particularly in ensuring that their roof is free of nests.
Plus, the neighbors don’t look too happily at a 79-year-old man high up on a ladder cleaning out his gutters, Raymond said, letting out a laugh.
Coupled with Elsie’s recent diagnosis, the Whitneys decided now was the time to finally say ‘yes’ once the yearly ask came in.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of people living with Alzheimer’s in 2020 was nearly seven million and that number is only set to double come 2060. With the help of the Alzheimer’s Association chapter in Vermont, the couple has launched a fundraiser with a goal of $1,500, where people can donate under Elsie’s name.
Just days before the tree would make its home on Burlington’s most iconic street, a crowd of roughly 40 people gathered outside the Whitney’s home to send it off with some cheers and, of course, a champagne toast.
“It was just a special thing to see everybody with family,” Raymond said. “All the neighbors were out here with their kids. And we toasted our tree and said, ‘See you on Church Street.’”
But the celebrations weren’t just one-sided. The tree also put on a show for the crowd, doing a pirouette dance as it was lifted into the air, a gesture that the Whitney’s took personally.
“It danced for us,” Raymond said, looking fondly at Elsie, who was looking, in the same way, back at him.

Alive
Astrid Longstreth, 16, West Bolton
The stars are reflected in the glimmer of the headlamps’ light on the snow,
and the air is frozen – it feels like the sensation of holding your hand under water so burning-hot that it begins to feel cold,
somehow.
Nothing could be more perfect than feeling air rush in and out of your lungs, feeling alive when all is still.
I am alive.

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)I’ve been thinking a lot about what it really costs to stay alive in this country. Not in the spiritual sense – in the literal one. The bills. The trade-offs. The quiet math families do when pain meets the price tag.
When I was 20, I broke my ankle. I had insurance. I did everything I was supposed to. Still, I’m paying for it – literally – years later. The surgery cost nearly $50,000. Even with insurance, I owed more than $10,000 out of pocket – payments that stretched on long after my leg healed.
More recently, I hurt my wrist chopping firewood to heat our home. My first thought wasn’t “how bad is it?” it was “can I afford to get this looked at?”
That’s the part people outside this reality don’t understand. It’s not the injury that breaks you, it’s the hesitation. The pause before asking for help because you already know the answer: it depends on your deductible.
Across the Shenandoah Valley where I live, people make this same calculation. Can I afford to get better?
We don’t talk about it much, but the numbers tell the story plain: about four in 10 adults in America carry medical or dental debt, and rural folks are more likely to struggle with it than people living in urban areas. Research shows medical problems and bills are among the leading contributors to personal bankruptcy. And for about seven in 10 adults with health care debt, the bills came from a one-time or short-term medical expense – a single hospital visit, an ER trip, or an unexpected procedure. One broken bone. One bad diagnosis. One stroke of bad luck, and your whole future can tip.
You learn to live smaller after that, to stretch prescriptions, to work through pain, to keep quiet about what hurts. To walk around with the silent fear that your body might betray your budget.
We’ve all become experts at pretending the system is normal, because it’s the only one we’ve ever known. But it’s not normal, it’s a choice.
Other nations – Norway, Canada, Germany, France, Japan, just to name a few – have made different choices about how to care for their people. None of them are perfect, and they’re not all the same. But they’ve each decided on one simple idea: getting sick shouldn’t mean going broke.
These countries pay for it in different ways, some through higher taxes, some through shared insurance systems, but the result is the same: people don’t have to hesitate before calling a doctor when something’s wrong. It’s not socialism. It’s just a society deciding that health care is part of the common good – like roads, schools, or clean water.
When I spoke recently with journalists from Norway and Sweden, they told me what care looks like where they live.
In Norway, a hospital stay doesn’t come with a payment plan. Education is free, prescriptions are affordable, and families don’t go bankrupt because a child gets sick.
People still work hard – farmers, factory workers, teachers – but they do it knowing one injury or illness won’t destroy everything they’ve built.
They pay more in taxes, but what they get in return is peace of mind. They don’t hesitate before calling the doctor. They don’t lie awake wondering if this month’s paycheck will cover both medicine and the electric bill.
It’s not a perfect system, none are, but it’s one built on the idea that care is a shared responsibility, not a luxury.
Here in America, we’ve built something powerful – some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world. But access to them depends on what’s in your wallet.
Unfortunately, we also end up paying more for worse results by almost every measure: lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, and higher rates of chronic illness than other wealthy nations. In the country with the largest economy in the world, we still treat health care like a privilege to be earned. We’ve built a system where survival comes with fine print, where you can buy a truck on credit more easily than you can see a specialist.
I don’t bring this up as a political argument. This isn’t about right or left, it’s about right or wrong.
It’s about neighbors, parents, co-workers – about the next time you hear someone cough in a quiet room and realize how fragile we all are – how easily health can become debt.
When I think about the future I think about my children and how I want them to inherit something better than this quiet cruelty. I want them to live in a country where care isn’t a privilege you earn but a promise we keep to one another.
Because someday, it won’t just be a headline. It’ll be someone you love sitting in an exam room, staring at a clipboard, doing the math in their head.
Wondering if healing is something they can afford.
We can do better than that.
We have to.
Because in the land of plenty, no one should have to go broke just to stay alive.

Built after the previous one was destroyed by Hurricane Ida, residents can now go there for free therapy, paid for with funds from the parish’s cut of Louisiana’s opioid settlement money.
“We really wanted to make sure that when people wanted the help they had someone they could call,” says Nicole Bourgeois, a Lafourche Parish native who filled different mental health related roles for the parish until the new funding enabled them to pay her as a full-time counselor.
The free counseling program is a rare example of opioid money directly reaching people in Louisiana who need help. Three years into the process of paying out funds from landmark settlements reached between states and major opioid producers and distributors, it’s hard to see what Louisiana has done to combat addiction with the roughly $100 million disbursed across the state.
Meanwhile, the opioid crisis continues to claim hundreds of lives every year in the state alone.

The devastation had led municipalities across the country to sue companies like Johnson & Johnson, Purdue Pharma and Walgreens. Together they secured billions in settlements from the industry and created a system where each state drew up its own rules for spending the money.
While there are national guidelines that feature in each state’s approach, the resulting programs vary widely state-by-state, primarily in the way funds are distributed and spending is overseen.
Louisiana took a decentralized approach, dispersing money to local jurisdictions who operate with little oversight from a task force and supporting state-run nonprofit established by then-Attorney General Jeff Landry.
No other state gives as much of its power to fund opioid abatement directly to local law enforcement. Louisiana is also the only state with no state-level program, apart from operating costs for the nonprofit and task force, while directing 20% of the funds to local sheriffs.

Spending some of the funding on law enforcement and the criminal justice system at large is sensible, says Jason Stoltman founder and director of the Opioid Policy Institute, which he founded in 2020 to bridge the gap between knowledge and action about opioid addiction. Recently, the institute co-created a website where suspected waste, fraud and abuse can be reported.
In Louisiana, reports include a complaint about the 20% allocation to sheriffs and a $250,000 full-body X-ray purchased by the Tangipahoa Parish Sheriff’s Office for the local jail.
“I have no problem with even a good chunk of money going to law enforcement,” he notes. “I do want them to find the people who are making pressed fentanyl pills that are killing people. If it goes to investigations, if it goes to the correctional system to help people with opioid use disorder in the correctional system — great, whatever,” he adds. “But it can’t be all.”
The money allocated to law enforcement doesn’t end with the $20.2 million distributed to Louisiana sheriffs so far. Most parishes have allocated a majority of their funding to local courts and district attorney’s offices. Police departments, too, are vying for the funds. All of Terrebonne Parish’s expenditures reported as of this year, close to $1 million, went to the Houma Police Department.

Funds allocated to courts or DA’s offices primarily go toward drug-court related expenses, according to reports obtained by The Current, although it’s unclear to what extent they fund additional positions or reduce associated costs for participants in drug court or pre-trial diversion programs.
“We’ve always tried to do what we can,” says Beauregard Parish District Attorney Brian Lestage, referring to his staff’s commitment to exploring alternative options for those facing criminal charges and living with addiction. His office receives $2,200 per month from the local police jury, paid out of the parish’s opioid funds. “It allows accountability and focus that you’re going to spend those hours,” he asserts.
In many cases that spending is labeled as “treatment,” including in Beauregard, despite none of the funds going directly toward treating people suffering from opioid addiction. “It’s hard to drill down and be like: Did it actually go to real treatment that helps people?” Stoltman says. Over the first two years of reported spending, $1.6 million worth have been labeled as treatment-related expenses, despite a significant portion of those funds going to DA’s offices.
“We would expect any community organization to get this money, to show what the impact is,” he points out. “I expect that of law enforcement.”

Toothless
Transparency on how funding is spent, however, is severely lacking in Louisiana.
Sheriffs aren’t required to publicly report their spending, leaving it up to state auditors, who otherwise have little involvement with opioid abatement, to find evidence of misuse. Parishes are supposed to report their spending to the Louisiana Opioid Abatement Task Force.
To date, only 35 parishes have filed reports for the first two years worth of funds, with only 23 reporting any funds spent.
The Louisiana Opioid Abatement Administration Corp., the nonprofit created to receive and administer settlement funds, and support the task force in carrying out its responsibilities, says it’s still analyzing the latest reports covering the third year of funding, which were due in March of this year. It is unclear how many of those reports have been filed by parishes so far. Administrators haven’t furnished the reports in response to several records requests by The Current.
Meanwhile, the task force’s primary role is to advise parishes on spending priorities and review their spending by way of reports. But it’s functionally toothless. The memorandum of understanding establishing the task force doesn’t equip it with any enforcement tools.
“They don’t have the authority to intercept funds,” says Vic Franckiewicz, the task force’s outside legal counsel.
Still, administrators say they’re working with parishes that haven’t yet filed their reports to identify and clear any issues they might face. They also say they’re putting together a report on the task force’s activities, the first since its board first met three years ago.
This leaves a power vacuum that creates no meaningful oversight, a May report by the Louisiana Legislative Auditor pointed out. “No entity has been specifically tasked with enforcing the terms of the opioid settlement agreements in Louisiana,” auditors concluded.
“I think the task force has the ability to do this,” says Otha “Curtis” Nelson, the corporation’s executive counsel. “We’re just into year five of this entire process.”
Even in states where funding is allocated directly to local governments, it’s possible to create a transparent system that allows for public oversight and offers opportunities for a wide variety of groups to apply.

‘People’s money’
In November 2022, the same month that Louisiana’s task force first met, in neighboring Arkansas, cities and counties banded together to create the Arkansas Opioid Recovery Partnership to administer their share of the money.
The partnership reviews and then approves or denies projects proposed across the state, publishing every decision, along with project descriptions, on a dedicated website.
“Being that you’re dealing with people’s money, we wanted to be very transparent,” says Kirk Lane, the partnership’s director and a former chief of police of Benton, Arkansas. “We didn’t want anything slipping through the cracks.”
As of October, the partnership has received 513 applications requesting a total of $424 million, of which 208 projects at a cost of $32 million were approved, funding purchases of the overdose-reversing drug Naloxone, hundreds of sober living beds and peer recovery specialists, among a plethora of other prevention, treatment and recovery projects.
Every county in the state currently has at least one project funded through the partnership’s portion of Arkansas’ opioid abatement funds. Where the state was investing heavily in for-profit treatment providers, Lane says the partnership decided to focus on the nonprofit space and recovery programming, especially in rural and underserved areas.
“Because we’re trying to build new arrows in that quiver that could really help the population that was there,” he explains the partnership’s approach. “They don’t have to travel across three or four counties or parishes to get help. They could actually go right there where they live.”
Louisiana has a pot of money that could fund a similar program but has been slow to spend that too.
As of Oct. 2024, Louisiana had set aside $3.7 million (the equivalent of 3% of total settlement funds) for administrative costs, less than half a million of which had been spent, according to the Louisiana Legislative Auditor’s report.
For comparison, in Arkansas, the cost of operating several websites, an app that provides training on how to use Naloxone, and the partnership’s four-person staff has come in at just under $1.5 million so far, representing less than 2% of the state’s settlement funds.
Meanwhile, local recipients in Louisiana say they could use the help.

In need of guidance
Parishes and sheriff’s offices say they could use some help too. Several that have not spent funds said they are looking to the state’s task force for direction, according to a legislative auditor’s survey.
Whether the current task force is equipped to provide that guidance is doubtful.
Unlike Lane in Arkansas, none of Louisiana’s task force members appointed to represent local governments have a track record of working specifically on the issue of drugs or opioids. There are two physicians. One of which had to recently clarify to a task force member that fentanyl is an opioid, as the group weighed creating an “opioid czar.”
Outside of the two physicians, the remaining task force members are appointed by the Louisiana Municipal Association, the Louisiana Sheriffs’ Association and the Police Jury Association of Louisiana. Administrative support is provided by the Louisiana District Attorney’s Association.
If left unused, any funds set aside for administrative expenses would eventually also be distributed to the parishes and sheriffs, the auditor’s report notes.
The slow pace at which Louisiana and other states have moved in spending their funds is frustrating to experts like Stoltman. “It’s an active crisis,” he says. “Nobody’s acting with the speed that’s needed.”
Since the Louisiana Opioid Abatement Administration Corp. recorded its first deposit of opioid settlement funds at the end of 2022, over 2,000 Louisianans have died from opioid-related overdoses.
Seeing the opioid settlement funds simply as positions in a budget and an administrative task to tackle risks its potential to save lives and keep families whole, Lane notes. “Early on we called it blood money,” he says. “You got to look at it as hope.”

Erin Stewart is betting it is.,"Erin Stewart is chronically unfiltered, casually profane and rarely off the record. Over coffee at Cafe Busy Bean, a brisk one-minute walk from her recently vacated office in New Britain’s City Hall, Stewart inquired about the recording app on a reporter’s iPhone. She wanted to make sure it was on.
For the past dozen years, Stewart has been viewed in political circles as occupying a space between curiosity and bona fide phenomenon — a young, white Republican woman elected mayor at age 26 in a Democratic city of 74,000, where 63% of the population are people of color.
Now 38, she is one of two declared candidates for the Republican gubernatorial nomination, hell-bent on testing the notion that the Grand Old Party is ready to be led by a firefighter’s salty daughter, a blue-collar product of New Britain’s public schools and its Central Connecticut State University.
She is a digital native who began posting an edgy series of YouTube videos 11 months ago titled, “Erin It Out.” In the debut, she described a drunken alderman questioning her legitimacy as mayor, bullying her with vulgarities that Stewart quoted in full. Another off-color episode was titled, “WTF?”
Her campaign video announcement posted on Nov. 18, a week after exiting City Hall with an undefeated record in six mayoral elections. It was devoid of f-bombs but opened with a 10-second parody mocking typical campaign promises and pieties, followed by a pivot to a candidate promising something different.

“When we were talking about what we wanted to do, I said, ‘I don’t want to do some cookie-cutter bullshit.’ I just want to be me,” Stewart said. “If you think that anybody’s gonna not let me be me, I got a problem, and I’m out. I can’t. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to pretend to be somebody that I’m not.”
In her first public campaign event, a rally two days later in the chilly concourse of the New Britain ballpark abandoned in 2015 by the Colorado Rockies Double-A affiliate for flashier new digs in Hartford, she told supporters that the rationale for her campaign was simple.
“You are going to hear this a lot,” Stewart said. “Because it’s time for something different.”
Something different. 
Much is packed into those two words. 
“Oh, God, so much,” Stewart said. “I mean, just first off, look at me, right? My age, my background as a 12-year mayor of a very Democrat city in Connecticut. I mean, I’m a mom of two, working mom of two young kids — or maybe not so working anymore.”

Laughing, she corrected herself. Since noon on Nov. 12, she’s been jobless: “An unemployed mom of two young kids, and I gonna have to lean into that, right?”
Stewart says she already has been asked in a radio interview how she will manage as a candidate and mother, a question she rarely hears posed to men. (John G. Rowland was 33 and the father of three young children when he won the GOP nomination in 1990.)
She is married to Domenic Mutone, a city employee whom she met rom-com-cute on a ride-along with a snow-plow driver during her first big snowstorm as mayor. Their engagement picture was taken on the plow. Through what she called non-mayoral promotions, he became a general foreman and then a superintendent in the city’s public works department. They are parents of a boy and girl, ages 2 and 5.
Something different also is a gibe at the two rich businessmen who led Republicans to defeat in Connecticut’s past four gubernatorial elections: Tom Foley losing to Dannel P. Malloy in 2010 and 2014, and Bob Stefanowski losing to Ned Lamont in 2018 and 2022. They also are a dig at Lamont, 71, a beneficiary of both generational and entrepreneurial wealth whose home is Greenwich. 
Neither Foley nor Stefanowski had previously sought elective office, but both brought a willingness to spend their own funds, as did Lamont. Stewart intends to the use the state’s public financing program.
Her rival for the GOP nomination is a younger son of Greenwich, state Sen. Ryan Fazio. He is a 35-year-old investment advisor and graduate of Greenwich High School and Northwestern University. In his third term, he has been endorsed by the leaders of the legislature’s Republican minorities, Sen. Stephen Harding of Brookfield and Rep. Vincent J. Candelora of North Branford.
And Stefanowski, who considered Stewart as a running mate in 2022, extended an informal endorsement of Fazio on Lee Elci’s radio show, a popular venue for Republicans. Stefanowski is a foil in one of the stories Stewart tells about her being different, someone who might expand the GOP base.

“My God, I have to tell this story,” Stewart said. “It’s, like, embarrassing, but I have to tell it.”
And she does.
Stewart described Stefanowski and his wife, Amy, accepting her invitation to her inaugural ball in 2021, a fundraiser for charity.
“This was when I was being rumored as running as his lieutenant governor. I was going through a whole other thing with that,” Stewart said. “And he looks to me, and he comes up to me with someone else, and they go, ‘There’s so many people of color in the room, Erin.’ And I looked at them, and I just kind of I took a deep breath, and I go, ‘That’s what winning looks like.’”
Stefanowski had no comment.
Stewart’s appeal to a demographic atypical of Republican candidates was undeniable during her six runs for mayor, but is it scalable? Or reflective of an instinctive retail politician’s ability to engage in a smallish city where everyone seems to know everyone else?
She said she believes both can be true, while readily acknowledging that social circles in New Britain can be surprisingly small. Her Democratic successor, Bobby Sanchez, is the uncle of Stewart’s old boyfriend, Manny Sanchez, now a Democratic state representative.

Her father, Timothy Stewart, a retired firefighter, is a former mayor who left office in 2011. Only two years — and a one-term Democrat she unseated — separate her tenure from his. Her great uncle was Dominic J. Badolato, an AFSCME leader who represented New Britain in the General Assembly for two decades, winning collective bargaining for state and municipal employees.
“One of the things about growing up in a community like New Britain, which I think that people who live in urban centers can relate to, is that you learn how to shift and adapt pretty quickly to your environment to make it by,” Stewart said. “You can put me in the middle of Greenwich or Darien, and I’ll be OK. Certainly not going to be using terminology that I would use here. There would be a refined version of what you see. But, not, you know, not too much.”
Her opening message included an appeal to urban voters, at least on the issue of school choice, less so on the prospect of nudging suburbs to be more open to affordable housing. At the ballpark, she spoke of Connecticut as a rich state with a deficit of opportunities.
“The opportunity to live here and retire here without getting shackled by taxes and the highest cost of living in the country. Or to pay electric bills without having to win the damn lottery. The opportunity for a mother in Bridgeport to send her kid to school knowing that they’re getting a great education, and if she can’t, then the opportunity for that mom to send her kids to a school who can,” Stewart said. “How about the opportunity to live in a town where zoning decisions aren’t being made by Ned Lamont and the Hartford clowns?”

What does she mean about giving that Bridgeport mom a choice? Does that mean the right to send her child to a school in neighboring Fairfield if there is room? Does it mean more charter schools?
“It could mean any of that,” Stewart said. 
Stewart pronounces herself a fan of  “Waiting for Superman,” a 2010 documentary that follows five children vying for entrance into competitive urban charter schools seen as a ticket out of failing public schools. It was made by Davis Guggenheim, the documentarian who won the 2007 Oscar for “An Inconvenient Truth.”
As one of Connecticut’s 10 lowest-performing school districts, New Britain is deemed an Opportunity District by the state, eligible for extra funding intended to promote innovation.  Stewart complained that success can mean a punishing loss of funds. In her view, Connecticut’s system for funding education, primarily through an Education Cost Sharing formula that largely dictates where state education aid goes, is “completely broken.”
Two weeks into her campaign, Stewart is not ready to propose changes, nor disclose who is advising her. 
“You won’t see it yet. OK, we have been meeting extensively about details of the platform, that’s for sure,” Stewart said, adding that her goal is “restructuring the formula of how school districts are given their state education money.”
The run for governor is her second. She briefly was a candidate for the nomination in 2018, abandoned to compete in a three-way primary for lieutenant governor. She finished second.
Her campaign announcement last month came at a dark time for Republicans, hard on the heels of a blue wave in municipal contests that were the first general elections since Donald Trump returned to the White House. A similar result in 2017, the president’s first year office, was followed by a Democratic sweep the next year in Connecticut.
“All I can control is my message,” she said.

That message includes sharing that she voted for Trump in all three of his presidential elections while insisting she should not be defined by him. She said she views his efforts to control border security as a success but questions the depth and breadth of the crackdown on undocumented immigrants.
“Pulling people out of Home Depot to … fill a quota? I could do without that,” she said.
Stewart said she shares Trump’s skepticism about wind power, mainly because she sees it as too expensive. But she disagreed with his administration issuing a stop-work order on Revolution Wind, an off-shore project that was 80% complete.
“To be that far along in the process and then just pull a plug on something just to prove a point was pretty, pretty foolish. And then what happens to the workers there?” Stewart said.
“I’m OK with talking about those things, because I don’t believe that feeling like that makes me any less Republican than anyone else,” Stewart said. “However, there are others that are like, I’m supposed to be like Braveheart in the front lines,  carrying the banner.”
In Trump’s first term, Stewart was invited to the White House as an urban mayor happy to applaud his “opportunity zone” policy providing tax incentives in distressed communities. She said they have been a factor in drawing new housing and other developments to New Britain, as have state grants obtained working with the administrations of Lamont and Malloy.
In April, she attended the signing of an executive order “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” It was an opportunity to meet the interior secretary, Doug Burgum, and talk about policies that might bring down the cost of electricity in Connecticut.

She used the visit to make a dig at Fazio, the ranking member of the legislature’s Energy and Technology Committee. Stewart said he declined her invitation to join her, fearful of being seen at a Trump administration event.
“And I was like, ‘Are you kidding me?’” she said.
Fazio, who did not become a candidate until four months later, recalls the conversation with Stewart differently: there was a discussion about energy issues, not an invitation. Like Stewart, he says he, too, voted three times for Trump.
Lamont has no plan to question either candidate’s fealty to the president.

(Photo from University of Denver)When the attack came, Black Kettle believed it must have been a mistake. The old chief gathered a 33-star United States flag that had been given to him a few years before as a sign of friendship with the federal government and, along with a white flag, hoisted them above his tipi.
But the dawn attack on the Cheyenne and Arapaho encampment at Big Sandy Creek on the cold and snowy high plains of eastern Colorado was no mistake, as would be testified to later at an Army inquiry and a Congressional investigation. The intent of Col. John M. Chivington, commanding more than 700 Union troops that day, was slaughter.
“I long to be wading in gore,” Chivington had declared just days before.
We know what happened next that day from the Army’s perspective largely because of one man, a 26-year-old captain named Silas Soule who refused an unlawful order and stood down his cavalry company while the rest engaged in carnage and worse.
The question of resisting illegal orders becomes a flash point in American politics every generation or so — just think of the My Lai Massacre of 1968 — and it comes today because of revelations about the Trump administration’s boat strikes in international waters. As first reported by The Washington Post, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth’s spoken order directing the first boat attack was “kill them all.” When two survivors were seen clinging to burning wreckage, missiles were launched to kill them, too.
It is a war crime to kill shipwrecked combatants under the international laws of war, as understood by the U.S. military. The situation is further compounded because no war has been declared in the action that has killed more than 80 individuals alleged to have been drug traffickers, without any evidence given to Congress or the public.
In addition, six Democratic lawmakers, all with prior service, are under investigation by Trump’s FBI for recording a video reminding service members they have a duty to refuse unlawful orders. The video doesn’t mention the boat strikes, but it doesn’t have to.
What is sickening about the threads that runs through Sand Creek, My Lai, and the supposed drug boat strikes, is the inherent racism and coordinated cruelty. In each case, the U.S. military targeted non-white groups of civilians. After annihilating them with superior firepower, their villages were burned to the ground or their boats turned into flotsam, all without trial. But in the cases of Sand Creek and My Lai, there were service members who resisted.
At Sand Creek, it was Silas Soule.
On March 16, 1968, it was 25-year-old helicopter pilot Hugh Thompson Jr. who flew over My Lai and noted the bodies of women and children in an irrigation ditch. He landed and asked Lt. William Calley what was going on.
“Just following orders,” Calley replied.
“Orders? Whose orders?”
“Just following …”
“But these are human beings,” Thompson argued, “unarmed civilians, sir.”
Thompson and his crew got back into their chopper. Those still alive in the ditch were being executed and some of the women raped. At the edge of the village, he spotted soldiers going after about 10 villagers who were running for a bomb shelter. Realizing he was about to witness murder, Thompson landed his helicopter between the soldiers and the villagers. His intervention ended the massacre.
Thompson reported the atrocities to superiors, but his complaints were ignored until news of the massacre broke in the American press. There is no official count of the dead at My Lai, but estimates place the number between 300 and 500. Calley was eventually tried in 1970 and convicted of 22 murders. Calley was one of 25 charged in the case, but the only one convicted.

The Sand Creek Massacre of Nov. 29, 1864, is among the darkest chapters in American history, in which hundreds of Indigenous people — mostly women and children — were slaughtered as retribution for the murder of a family of white settlers at their cabin on Box Elder Creek, more than 100 miles to the northwest. It was assumed they had been killed by an Arapaho raiding party. The mutilated bodies of the four Hungates had been exhumed and put on display in downtown Denver, whipping the city into hysteria. But there was no conclusive evidence that linked the attack to the Arapahos or any other first nation.
In winter 1864, the Civil War was winding down in the states — Colorado was still a frontier territory — and what would come to be known as the Plains Indian Wars was just getting started. Territorial Gov. John Evans had placed Chivington in command of an Indian-fighting regiment, one mostly composed of soldiers who had enlisted for just 100 days and others who were in volunteer companies who had fought the confederates at Glorietta Pass in New Mexico Territory and elsewhere.
Silas Soule was born in Maine and was a radical abolitionist, like his parents. The family came to Lawrence in Kansas Territory in October 1855, settling into a cabin along Coal Creek. Silas became a friend of John Brown and was among the “Immortal Ten” who freed an operator of the Underground Railroad from a Missouri jail.
Silas had sought his fortune during the Pikes Peak gold rush, but at the start of the Civil War he enlisted in a Colorado infantry company. He saw action in New Mexico Territory against the Confederates, including the 1862 battle at Glorieta Pass. By 1864, Soule was captain of a cavalry company assigned to Fort Lyon on the Santa Fe Trail. With his commanding officer, Maj. Edward Wynkoop, he attended several significant peace talks with Cheyenne and Arapaho leaders, including one at Camp Weld at Denver with Black Kettle.
Black Kettle was a leading advocate for peace for his people.
“All we ask is that we have peace with the white,” he said during the Camp Weld Conference, according to the National Park Service page about his life. “We want to hold you by the hand.”
The Cheyenne and other nations were feeling the pressure from white settlement, were buffeted by the volatility of the Civil War, and faced a scarcity of food on the barren lands to which they were increasingly confined. The new reserve at Big Sandy Creek offered a meager bounty. Some of the First Peoples had turned to cattle theft to keep from starving, while others engaged in a shooting war and sometimes took white hostages. There were scores of dead on both sides.
In late November 1864, Chivington — who wanted a victory against the Indians to launch a political career — decided to attack the encampment at Big Sandy Creek. Black Kettle thought the camp was safe from attack because he had reported to Fort Lyon and had been told to return to his camp to await an official delegation.
Chivington, the “fighting parson,” had been a Methodist missionary in Kansas and Nebraska but allowed his men to drink heavily the night before the attack. Along the way, he had posted guards at farms and outposts to prevent anyone from warning Black Kettle. He also had a heated argument with Soule, who said he thought the encampment of Cheyenne and Arapaho were not preparing for war.
“Any man that would take part in the murders, knowing the circumstances as we do, is a low-lived cowardly son of a bitch,” Soule said.
Chivington accused Soule of inciting mutiny and threatened to have him hanged. During the attack, Soule refused to take part and led his company of about 100 men a distance away, across the creek.
Barking dogs alerted the village of Chivington’s approach.
Chivington’s troops circled the village and separated the inhabitants from their pony herds. He then fired withering volleys of grape shot from his quartet of 12-pounder mountain howitzers. Then for the next eight hours — using artillery, rifles, pistols, hatchets and knives — his troops slaughtered hundreds of men, women and children.
Soule may not have interfered because his company was outnumbered by Chivington’s men 6 to 1.
There is no definitive count of the dead, but estimates range from 150 to 600. The National Park Service places the number at 230. Some warriors resisted the onslaught, but most of those in the encampment ran for their lives, seeking refuge in crevices along the banks of the Big Sandy or farther out on the plains. Others fled down the creek and dug sand pits for protection. They were blasted with more cannon fire.
Some of Chivington’s men raped the village women, killed babies, and mutilated bodies. Chivington had illegally ordered his men to take scalps, but a few also hacked genitalia from their female victims as trophies and later displayed them in Denver.
“When the Indians found there was no hope for them they went for the Creek and got under the banks and some of the (men) got their bows and a few rifles and defended themselves as well as they could,” Soule would later write his friend, Wynkoop. “By this time there was no organization among our troops. They were a perfect mob — every man on his own hook. My (company) was the only one that kept their formation, and we did not fire a shot.”
He described some of the atrocities that followed.
“I tell you, Ned, it was hard to see little children on their knees have their brains beat out by men professing to be civilized,” he wrote. “One (woman) was wounded a fellow took a hatchet to finish her, and he cut one arm off, and held the other with one hand and dashed the hatchet through her brain. One squaw with her two children, were on their knees, begging for the lives … the (mother) took a knife and cut the throats of both children and then killed herself.”
Although the killings were initially reported as a victory in Denver, reports of a massacre began to circulate. Investigations were launched, and Soule was the star witness. Chivington claimed the village was hostile and that the sand pits were actually pre-dug rifle pits, but the evidence was overwhelmingly against him. Although Chivington was condemned by a military justice panel, no charges were brought — against him or anyone else.
Black Kettle survived the massacre, as did his wife Medicine Woman Later, who was wounded nine times. Both were shot to death four years later by Custer’s Seventh Cavalry at the Battle of the Washita River near present-day Cheyenne, Oklahoma. It should be noted that the Cheyenne and Arapaho have their own histories of Sand Creek, which differ in significant ways from the predominantly white military narrative. I referred to some of these accounts in a chapter in my 2018 University Press of Kansas book, “Elevations.”
Soule lived only a few months after Sand Creek. He was killed by an assassin outside his Denver home on April 23, 1865.
Soule and Thompson have been called heroes, but the term falls short. They had courage, either to stand down or to stand up, but to describe their actions as heroic fails the element of basic human decency behind their decisions. They did what a rational person, familiar with American law and military custom, should do in similar circumstances. They were citizens, sworn to the U.S. Constitution, and beholden to an ideal instead of a commander. War is an awful business, fraught with moral ambiguity, but atrocities like Sand Creek and My Lai present a bright clear line of duty and conscience.
Seldom has that line been so apparent, and crossed so fragrantly as in the current boat attacks.
Assuming the boats were transporting drugs — and again, there has been no evidence presented to support that claim — the military should not be used as an execution force at the whim of politicians. We are not engaged in a war with drug traffickers. Annihilating a boat in the Caribbean is not the same as sending Seal Team 6 to kill Osama bin Laden, who personally directed the hijackers responsible the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
The continuing drug boat executions is contrary to the ideals of American democracy, military code and international law. But this time the atrocities are coming not from commanders on the ground but from the very top, the secretary of defense. In doing so, Hegseth displays a chilling embrace of killing civilians for political capital. His disproportionate use of power is the point.
A recent closed-door viewing by lawmakers of video from the Sept. 2 “double tap” strike that killed the shipwrecked survivors raised new questions, according to reporting by The New York Times. The men were monitored for up to an hour before the second attack, clinging to the bow of their capsized boat and trying in vain to right it. They were also seen in the video waving, although it wasn’t clear whether they were trying to summon help or ward off another attack.
Adm. Mitch Bradley, the operation’s commander, reportedly told lawmakers in the closed session that Hegseth hadn’t issued a “no quarter” order when it came to survivors. Trump administration explanations for the second strike have ranged from sinking the boat so it wouldn’t be a navigation hazard to stopping the men from recovering floating bales of drugs and continuing their mission.
But eliminating witnesses to the murders of other civilians might be the real motive. Somebody, somewhere, should have had the guts to try to stop this atrocity.
What allowed Soule and Thompson and others unknown to make the difficult choice to place themselves in physical and political jeopardy was a belief in the limits of force. These men were not pacifists. But they understood the civic sin of indiscriminate killing and wanton slaughter. In this, they separated themselves — and us — from those whose only excuse was that they were just following orders.

Maybe you missed this news, perhaps disturbed (yet unsurprised) by our President’s daily tirades… attacking Somalis as “garbage” one day, pardoning a convicted drug smuggler the next or his continued threats of invading Venezuela.  How easily we miss the closer-to-home news by getting distracted by these “bright, shiny objects.”
We all know that Connecticut drivers must cope with some of the highest gas prices, longest commutes, and oldest highways in the Northeast.  Now Washington has decided to dramatically weaken fuel-economy standards for new cars, cutting the 2031 target from roughly 50 mpg to about 34.  This threatens to make things worse for everyone, especially current and future electric-vehicle owners.
On the surface, the rollback is pitched by the White House as a win for “affordable cars,” claiming that these relaxed miles-per-gallon rules will shave maybe $900 off the cost of a new gas-powered SUV.  But for Connecticut commuters who routinely log 12,000–15,000 miles a year, those savings will evaporate quickly:  cars that burn more fuel cost more to operate, and in a pricey state like ours, the pump always gets paid.
But the bigger, less obvious impact of the mileage rules will be on electric-vehicle drivers– the very people who bought into the promise of lower operating costs, cleaner air, and a modernized transportation system.
According to the Connecticut Division of Motor Vehicles, there are 2.7 million cars and trucks in our small state.  But only about 60,000 of them are EVs.
For those current EV owners, the MPG rollback creates more uncertainty… beyond just finding a charging station.  EV resale values depend on strong future demand.  So when Washington signals that gasoline-powered cars will stay dominant longer, that EV market may sputter.  Fewer people will shop for EVs, fewer choose them, and used EV prices will likely soften.  
Federal tax incentives (up to $7,500) for new EV buyers already expired this fall but some Connecticut rebates continue… for now.
Then there’s the EV charging network — or, more accurately, the charging network we were promised. Federal programs launched with great fanfare in 2021 pledged 500,000 publicly available chargers nationwide. But fewer than 400 federally funded chargers have actually been built under the $7.5 billion program.
In Connecticut, fast-charging deserts for thirsty EVs persist across Litchfield County, the Quiet Corner, and shoreline towns east of New Haven. Even Fairfield County’s charging stations, while more plentiful, are frequently congested or out of service.
For future EV buyers, the rollback removes one of the biggest forces pushing automakers to build affordable electric models.  Without strict fuel-economy rules, carmakers can meet federal requirements by selling profitable gas-powered SUVs rather than investing in lower-cost EVs that would appeal to everyday drivers. The result? Slower arrival of mid-priced EVs, the very models that would make ‘going electric’ a realistic choice for middle-class families in these tight times.
Remember four years ago when Elon Musk promised us a Tesla for $25,000? In fact the new entry-level models now cost about $37,000 or more.
Here in Connecticut, where we import every gallon of fuel we burn, a slowdown in EV adoption is more than an environmental setback. It’s an economic one. More money will leave the state for out-of-region fuel suppliers. And an unreliable, underbuilt charging network threatens to stall our transportation future.
The real bottom line? You may find new gas-powered cars will be cheaper, but the cost of driving them will go up in (exhaust) smoke.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/tesla-charging.jpg,,,2025-12-07 04:57:43.984782

The report by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) examines Gulf Correctional Institution near Wewahitchka, which houses approximately 1,600 men. Certain staff members contributed, the report says, to what the SPLC labels “the culture of violence” through overly harsh punishments and degradation of people under their supervision.
The specifics include:

Property restriction, stripping inmates in solitary confinement down to their underwear, taking all their property, and leaving them to sleep on a cold, steel bunk for up to three days.
Denying meals for innocuous misconduct and delivering “air trays” to people in solitary confinement; for the benefit of the prison cameras, officers deliver a meal tray covered by a lid, with no food under that lid.
“Standing on the grate,” a practice of forcing people to stand over the storm drains in the yard for hours, sometimes stripped to their underwear or with their arms and legs in uncomfortable positions.
“Catfishing,” a practice in which officers order barbers to shave off all of someone’s hair and eyebrows.
Administering chemical agents like pepper spray to various parts of the body, including the mouth, ears, groin, and buttocks.
Verbal abuse and harassment, including racial slurs and threats of physical and sexual violence.

The SPLC team identified at least 200 incarcerated victims or witnesses and interviewed 95 of them, the report says. They requested and reviewed more than 20,000 pages of prison, health care, and Office of Inspector General reports covering at least 1,100 incidents over the past decade.
The authors added that the FDC resisted their efforts to gather information.
“In response to public records requests, FDC demanded payment of exorbitant fees — often thousands of dollars — before production. After payment, FDC took months to produce records, only then revealing that it had frequently forced the SPLC to pay for duplicates, records that SPLC did not actually request, and unjustified redactions.”
The report adds that, despite those barriers, “for the 27 victims and witnesses at Gulf who had corroborating prison records and were willing to come forward, the team documented their stories in declarations sworn under penalty of perjury.”
Those first-person accounts are included in an appendix to the report.
“Officers respond to small and big provocations with vicious beatings — punching people all over their bodies,” said Kelly Knapp, a senior staff attorney for the SPLC, in a video interview provided in the online summary. “Hitting them with their walkie-talkies. Choking people. Spraying them at close range with pepper spray in their eyes and their mouth and their ears. Sometimes pulling down their pants and spraying pepper spray between their buttocks.”
“I think if one-tenth of that is true, it highlights the fact that we have a department of chaos, and that these institutions that are anemically understaffed are the worst actors, and the places where the state has failed its citizens the most,” former Republican state Sen. Jeff Brandes told the Phoenix after reading the report.
Knapp said that with a vacancy rate for officers at around 50%, correction officers at Gulf are “overtaxed and overburdened.”
Staffing shortages
Florida prisons have faced significant staffing shortages throughout the years. They house more than 89,000 inmates, a population that has increased by more than 10,000 since 2021. That is expected to rise by another 4,100 over the next three years.
“We are managing today with relatively the same number of staff we had 10,000 inmates ago, so you can imagine what that’s doing to the staff and inmate ratios,” FCD Secretary Ricky Dixon told lawmakers in October.
The report says that as of September 2023, the operational staff vacancy rate at Gulf Correctional was 58%, tied for third highest in the state, according to consultants hired by FDC.
“The burden of overcrowding and understaffing often results in dangerous consequences for people incarcerated at Gulf,” the report says.
“Without adequate officer and investigator staffing, prison gangs thrive and perpetrate violence at the facility. Nearly every person interviewed reported that gangs essentially run the institution, with some officers afraid to intervene in attacks, indifferent to the violence, or complicit in their actions. For example, interviewees reported that certain officers frequently allowed people to enter through locked doors into dorms or cells without authorization to assault others at the facility or transfer contraband.”
Marc Caruso worked as a Florida corrections officer from 2010 to 2020.
“They need a whole new leadership from the top down,” he says in a video interview provided in the online summary of the report.
“The officers are tired. They’re burnt out. They know that we need new leadership. It’s the only way to make change in the department. You have to start at the top. You have to have a secretary that’s willing to take a bold stance on getting rid of the corruption in the department. And he has to have the backing of the governor. That’s the only way to do it.”
Since leaving the Legislature in 2022, Brandes founded and heads the Florida Policy Project, a think tank that focuses on statewide issues including criminal justice reform. He said the report “highlights how desperate the Department of Corrections is to address staffing and how, frankly, the Legislature has failed to adequately fund both the staffing and the oversight of these chronically understaffed facilities. “
“They’re setting themselves up for massive litigation over inmates being harmed because of the lack of staffing,” he adds. “At some juncture, it becomes unreasonable, and I think the courts would find that as well.”
The report lists three reforms that could reduce the level of violence in Florida prisons:

Reducing the prison population to “ensure a safe and management staff-to-prisoner ratio;
Investment in greater oversight of facilities and staff.
Improved working conditions and training for correctional staff.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)IOWA CITY — Academics, higher education leaders and Iowa lawmakers called the Center for Intellectual Freedom at the University of Iowa a good first step in bringing back traditional values of education, intellectual freedom and debate, but they said it must be protected and tightly controlled if it’s going to last.
The center’s two-day inaugural event continued Saturday with discussions of past and current efforts to build similar centers elsewhere in the United States. Discussion also included and updates on how the center at the UI — required by law passed last legislative session and governed by the Iowa Board of Regents rather than the university — came to be and where it’s headed in the future.

Panelists said the fact that the center is on the UI campus and yet outside of the institution’s control is a unique, and positive, aspect of its structure as it shields the center somewhat from hostile acts taken by those within the university.
“If you’re strictly inside, you tend to be taken over by the same forces that have pushed everything else in a certain direction and have been a threat to intellectual freedom,” said Daniel Bonevac, a philosophy professor at the University of Texas at Austin. “If you’re on the outside, then you can largely do what you want, you have almost no impact on the campus.”
Evidence from past efforts inform the new center
Bonevac said the new center has already avoided many “potholes” in how it was set up, but there are others that those who handle the center need to see coming.
Expanding on the theory expressed by Friday panelist Joshua Katz about university faculties and leadership being mostly made up of “sheep” and “crazies,” Bonevac said there also are “fellow travelers” who don’t personally ascribe to radical ideas but who take those voices very seriously. He also described “careers” who will offer their true opinions behind closed doors but not stand up for their thoughts in public.
“Radicals” who want to disrupt programs they are against “find something to complain about,” he said, and often connect it with a specific person who they say needs to go. “Fellow travelers” become concerned not with the program, which they have no problem with, but with the fact that not everyone is happy with what is going on. “Fellow travelers” then talk to “sheep,” who follow their lead, and higher-ups end up getting rid of that person and finding someone who won’t make “waves.”
“In short, you accommodate and you end up looking like you’re controlled by a cabal of the enemies of your original mission,” Bonevac said.

Panel affected by fear of retribution, center head says
The first panel of the day was initially supposed to include three academics, center interim director Luciano de Castro said, but one of the panelists dropped out due to fear of retribution from his university. The sessions held Friday and Saturday morning were originally supposed to be closed from the public, he said, but due to Iowa’s open meetings laws and the fact that enough center advisory council members were attending to make a quorum necessitated opening them to the public.
De Castro said he wasn’t considering this situation as “good” or “bad,” but used it as an example of a “trade-off” that ended with losing someone’s perspective. Aiming to ensure all of what is discussed at the event is available for people to peruse, de Castro said panelists will write articles based on what they presented and have them combined into a book that will be available next year.


He’s seen this happen time and time again at his own university, Bonevac said, with different programs that offered alternative curriculum becoming more “radical” at different paces. He said this was due to original leadership being forced out or leaving for their own reasons and being replaced with those unwilling to defend their mission and letting the program turn into something it was never supposed to be.
One example he provided was of a program he and others tried to create in 2001 called “Western civilization and American institutions,” which garnered donor interest and support from “our people” but opposition from faculty in the history, American studies and English departments. Bonevac said “they made the faculty council not approve this at all” and accused the leader of the initiative of “financial improprieties,” which he called absurd.
The leader was replaced with someone else and, while the program was created, it does not hold its original name and wasn’t what they imagined.
“It’s a good program, but it’s not at all what we had in mind,” he said, “and in terms of the overall effect on the campus, it’s been minimal.”
The best leaders for centers like the one at the UI need to be fully committed to the center’s mission and willing to speak up in its defense, including when that makes people angry. They also need to have a vision of excellence that encompasses the moral and the intellectual, Bonevac said, and be ready to set up a successor before they leave.
Admissions must also be controlled to ensure students “are on board with the mission” of the center, he said.
Chris Clemens, former University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill provost, posed four questions to those in the audience directly involved with the center — how will they hire, how will they reach people who aren’t already sympathetic to their goals, what will the center bring to campus and “what adjacent efforts can serve the reformers whose objectives and passions don’t fit to get to this particular focus.”
Rubrics for hiring should be made now and visibly, he said, and those leading the center should be prepared for the day when someone says something “disbelieving.” A communication plan and fallbacks for situations where things go wrong are also necessary to ensure the center stands strong in who is populating it.
Clemens said a common vision must be established for the center, and one of the things that went wrong at UNC was that the “philosophical and methodological differences” of those involved in initiatives were not figured out at the start.
“A center for intellectual freedom that has hiring preference and ideological filters is not a center for intellectual freedom,” Clemens said. “It lives with a contradiction in its soul that will kill it if you don’t resolve it now.”
Current efforts lend confidence to enduring strength
State and federal officials also took the panel stage Saturday to discuss the center’s inception and how they hope to help it succeed.
Regent Christine Hensley said “all the stars have aligned for this to come together,” with former regent and current Trump administration Assistant Secretary for Postsecondary Education David Barker and herself having both come onto the board with the idea for a center like the one now created and working together to make it a reality.
Barker, also a panelist with Hensley, state Rep. Taylor Collins and state Sen. Kerry Gruenhagen, said there wasn’t much interest when he brought the idea forward after joining the board six years ago, due to both money concerns and the lack of awareness of “how bad things had gotten at a lot of universities.”
Collins also drove the creation of the center by discussing legislation to remove diversity, equity and inclusion programs at universities that led to directives to do just that from the board of regents, Barker said, as well as explore the possibility of opening centers “like this.” While the University of Northern Iowa and Iowa State University both developed initiatives as a result of this directive, Collins said there wasn’t much action from the UI.
Hensley said she’s heard from students, their families and “seven-figure donors” who aren’t happy with the political balance of the UI and the “direction of the university.” Multiple panelists said many at the UI are not happy with the center’s creation, and Hensley pointed out there were no UI administrators in attendance. There have been “challenges” in working with the university, she said, in terms of logistics and competing information.
Neither UI nor board of regents spokespeople could say whether anyone from the UI was invited to the event.
With an advisory committee and bylaws set for the center, Hensley said next steps include launching the national search for a permanent director and conducting a marketing study to learn more about what classes and other resources should be offered through the center.
“I am extremely confident that we’re going to be very, very successful,” Hensley said.
What gives Barker confidence in the center is the quality of its advisory board, he said, and he hopes the center will develop surveys similar to free speech surveys already taken by Iowa university students to see whether students and faculty feel comfortable sharing what they feel in the classroom.
A question directed at Hensley asked why, if UI officials aren’t cooperating, can’t the board of regents just remove those leaders, to which she responded that leadership on the board of regents has recently changed and she is “hopeful” that this can be dealt with.
“I think that we have past leadership that just were not willing to deal with those issues, and the change in the leadership will begin to address those,” she said.
University of Iowa graduate student Clara Reynen asked panelists how the idea of universities getting worse as older faculty bring in new people with the same ideas and beliefs, which was expressed in Friday’s panels, can coexist with the fact that advisory committee members were chosen by de Castro and Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds and approved by the board rather than through an application process or other means.
De Castro said there were discussions in the creation of the center about its director having too much power, and the advisory council was created to be “out of reach” of the director and made up of people who will not go along with the majority decision and disagree when necessary.
“I want to emphasize this — this center is not about politics, it’s not about ideology, it’s about truth,” de Castro said. “It’s about academic excellence, and this we’re going to strive for.”

Danville residents voted overwhelmingly on Saturday against shuttering high school grades at the Danville School.
Well over 500 residents cast paper ballot votes during a townwide referendum at Danville School, with 480 votes against a measure to close high school grades versus 75 in favor, according to Danville’s moderator Toby Balivet.
“I’m proud of the town for turning out, I’m ecstatic for the turnout,” Danville school board Chair Clayton Cargill said after the results were announced.
The results sent a loud and clear message to the Caledonia Central Supervisory Union and Danville school board officials to keep high school grades open. After the results were announced, Cargill said it’s “pretty obvious that this town wants to be a town that operates a high school.”
“The town is proud of the high school,” he said, adding that the school board would “take that advice to heart.”
The referendum was first spurred by a citizen’s petition to close high school grades by June 30 and instead pay tuition for those high school students to attend other public or private schools.
Peter Mantius, a Danville resident and St. Johnsbury Academy teacher, submitted the petition, signed by more than 100 residents, in October.

The effort was partly motivated by anxiety around the future of school choice. State Sen. Scott Beck, R-Caledonia — a St. Johnsbury teacher — cautioned Cargill that legislation this upcoming session could limit school choice options in the future, and suggested the district should consider whether to shutter high school grades to maintain school-choice options in the future.
Cargill has since filed an ethics complaint against Beck, alleging he pushed for grade closures that would benefit the private school where he works.
School employees and officials, the community and students feared that closure would otherwise leave the region a public high school desert.
But the vote was complicated this week, when attorneys contracted by the district said the petition could not compel the Danville school board to move forward with closure — making Saturday’s referendum nonbinding.
School board officials previously said they would decide whether to go forward with closure based on the results of the referendum.

,CommonWealth Beacon,2025-12-06 23:21:59+00:00,CommonWealth Beacon,"Efficient electric equipment, powered by clean sources, is the answer to the energy affordability crunch",Vick Mohanka,,,,,https://commonwealthbeacon.org/opinion/efficient-electric-equipment-powered-by-clean-sources-is-the-answer-to-the-energy-affordability-crunch/,Better equipment and cheaper energy sources are critical to achieving an affordable energy future.,"IN THE WAKE of last month’s elections, one thing is clear: affordability is on the ballot. A poll released days later by the University of Massachusetts Amherst affirmed as much, with one in five respondents rating their own economic situation as “poor” and housing emerging as the most important issue facing Massachusetts.  
Yet while Massachusetts families struggle to make ends meet, Eversource’s CEO is boasting record quarterly earnings, driven by revenue collected from recent rate hikes. As we head into winter and heating bills climb, our leaders on Beacon Hill should stop quibbling about distant 2030 climate goals and instead focus on the root causes of rising energy costs today: runaway utility infrastructure spending, corporate greed, and an over-reliance on methane gas.  
Across the country, elected leaders are tackling affordability head-on.  
In New York City, Mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani built his campaign around lowering the cost of living, from the lunch rush to the cost of rent. In New Jersey, where residents struggle with similar energy dilemmas as those facing Massachusetts, Governor-elect Mikie Sherrill won handily by pledging to declare a state of emergency and freeze utility bills. In Georgia, the data center capital of the country, fed-up voters elected two pro-renewables candidates to the statewide Public Service Commission.  
Meanwhile, here in Massachusetts, Gov. Healey has put forward an energy affordability agenda, with her proposed legislation promising to result in $10 billion in savings. Legislators have similarly offered bills that will help bring energy costs down further by helping municipalities quickly deploy low-cost solar, ensuring new buildings use the latest energy efficiency standards, expanding the use of geothermal energy to heat our homes and buildings, and banning utilities from charging ratepayers for corporate travel, political activity, and advertising expenses.  
These solutions point to the reality we’re facing today: Better equipment and cheaper energy sources are critical to achieving that affordable energy future. And in 2025, as the index for natural gas is rising at nearly four times the rate of inflation, highly efficient electric alternatives like heat pumps powered by clean energy are how we bring down energy bills across Massachusetts. 
Knee-jerk reactions to double down on methane gas will set up Massachusetts families for more, not less, economic hardship. Not only has the price of methane gas risen to be the main source behind recent rate hike requests from Eversource and National Grid, but years of unchecked infrastructure spending has caused delivery charges to rise 20 percent each year since 2014.  
This isn’t just happening in Massachusetts: in 2024, two-thirds of the average gas bill nationwide went to delivery charges, and accelerated gas pipeline replacement spending is the main culprit. According to the American Gas Association, gas pipeline spending hit $49.1 billion in 2023, up 50 percent from the year prior.  
All this spending has sent utility corporate profits into the stratosphere, with Eversource’s electric side alone posting a $367 million profit for third quarter earnings. Eversource’s CEO, Joe Nolan, in 2023 took in almost $19 million from our bills and ranks among the highest paid utility executives in the country.  
Massachusetts has the tools to turn this around. Just as the Fair Share Amendment created free lunch in public schools and closed the MBTA’s operating budget gap by putting a tax on millionaires, Massachusetts can tap into excess corporate profits to create long-term solutions to bring down the cost of energy for working families.  
Our leaders should invest in solutions that ensure our low-income households don’t pay more than they deserve to get the latest, most efficient electric equipment, and landlords should be required to make their properties more affordable for renters by investing in energy efficiency and highly efficient heat pumps.  
There are already bright spots. All-electric building codes are spurring an affordable housing boom in Lexington. Boston’s decades-old steam loop is transitioning to highly efficient heat pumps powered by thermal energy from the Charles River, allowing hundreds of buildings to access cheap, clean heat. Thanks to the Department of Public Utilities, heat pump owners can expect to see more than $500 in savings this winter, and solar, wind, and batteries are driving down energy prices. And late last month, the DPU pushed back on Eversource’s 17 percent rate hike request, resulting in $45 million in savings for 303,000 customers.  
Our climate commitments are starting to crack down on utility overspending as well. This past spring, the DPU made an initial ruling to rein in gas utility pipeline spending, a move that is expected to cut the gas system enhancement plan, or GSEP, surcharge on utility bills by 17 percent. The department also proposed ending line extension allowances, an outdated practice that has allowed gas utilities to pass on the cost of adding new customers to its system to existing customers, a fee that costs ratepayers up to $160 million each year. 
As we head into colder weather and people grapple with higher and higher energy bills, the biggest tool our elected officials can use to help build a more affordable Massachusetts is efficient electric equipment powered by clean energy. It’s time they use it.

On Wednesday, a bipartisan coalition of lawmakers sent a letter to House leadership seeking urgent reauthorization of the “Secure Rural Schools and Self-Determination Program,” which provided 32 Montana counties with $16 million from the U.S. Forest Service in 2023. 
All four members of Montana’s federal delegation signed on to the letter seeking the funding as a standalone measure or attached to broad, year-end funding legislation. 
But that funding expired in 2023, and was not reauthorized during budget negotiations last year. 
And despite a bill co-sponsored by Montana Sens. Steve Daines and Time Sheehy, passing the Senate in  June, the House has yet to take up a vote. 
The SRS program helps counties with large swaths of public, tax-exempt forest land that previously received revenue from timber sales. The federal government has a funding formula to share 25% of revenue generated on federal land based on economic activity, timber harvest levels and other considerations that vary by county, with payments going toward rural schools, road maintenance and other programs that serve the counties. 
“Rural counties, parishes, and boroughs across the country are already facing the impact of the program’s expiration,” the letter states. “The SRS program underscores the vital partnership between federal land management and local government services, supporting everything from wildfire mitigation and forest health to the maintenance of roads and support of public schools. With longstanding and strong bipartisan support behind SRS, Congress must reaffirm its commitment to these rural counties.”
In Montana, Northwest counties, the heart of the once dominant timber industry, receive the most money.
