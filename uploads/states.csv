The DOJ is also demanding Colorado turn over all records related to the 2024 election, a massive trove of documents that could include ballots and even voting equipment. The Colorado inquiry, the most sweeping publicly known request, underscores the extent of the administration’s attention on state election activities.
At least nine states have received requests for information over the past three months, according to letters from the DOJ obtained by Stateline. Some states also received emails from a DOJ official last week asking for meetings to discuss information-sharing agreements.
The department’s focus on elections comes after President Donald Trump directed U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi in March to seek information about suspected election crimes from state election officials and empowered her to potentially withhold grants and other funds from uncooperative states.
For years, Trump has advanced false claims about elections, including the idea that the 2020 election that he lost was stolen. Now back in power, his administration is taking a new level of interest in how states — and even local authorities — administer elections.
Colorado Letter SoS Griswold
Last week, a political operative approached several Republican county clerks in Colorado to enlist them in election integrity efforts in light of Trump’s sweeping March executive order overhauling elections administration. One clerk told Stateline the operative claimed to represent the White House.
“Whatever the Trump administration tries to pull is very unlikely to be successful,” Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat, said in an interview, calling Colorado elections very secure. “With that said, do I think they are trying to undermine our elections at large in this country? Absolutely.”
DOJ has sent letters to Alaska, Arizona, Minnesota, Nevada, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, in addition to the request to Colorado.
The letters have typically asked election officials to describe how they register voters and work to identify duplicate registrations and individuals not eligible to vote, such as people with felony convictions and those who have died. The Washington Post earlier Wednesday reported on the letters; Votebeat and NPR previously reported on some of the letters as well.
Most letters also ask about each state’s process for flagging noncitizen applicants. Noncitizen voting is against federal law and incredibly rare, but Trump and his allies have promoted false claims about its prevalence. The Trump administration is also conducting a general crackdown on illegal immigration.
The letters call on election officials to turn over voter registration lists, which in some instances contain data on millions of residents in their states. This request has raised the most concerns, with some experts saying it’s unclear exactly why the DOJ wants the information.
“They don’t make much sense as law enforcement investigations. That makes me think that there’s some other purpose,” said Justin Levitt, who served as senior policy adviser for democracy and voting rights in the Biden White House and is now a law professor at Loyola Marymount University.

While many states make their voter registration lists available to the public, Levitt emphasized the data could still be largely off-limits to the federal government. Federal privacy law sometimes restricts how the government can use data that’s publicly obtainable. The DOJ may need voter information in some individual circumstances, but “that’s not blanket permission to go vacuuming up data.”
The DOJ didn’t respond to questions for this story.
Federal laws restrict the federal government’s ability to centralize information on Americans, said David Becker, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. Even if states provide voter registration information to the public, they often redact sensitive information.
In Orange County, California, the DOJ sued local election officials in June, seeking unredacted voter registration information, such as Social Security numbers and driver’s licenses, as part of an investigation into noncitizen voting.
More than 350 election officials from some 33 states participated in a conference call about federal actions on Monday hosted by Becker, who was previously an attorney in the DOJ Voting Rights Section during the administrations of Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. He said the interest in the call shows the level of uncertainty and anxiety over the current “federal imposition” on election administrators.
“The DOJ seems dead set on acquiring personal information on voters, including driver’s license numbers, Social Security numbers and dates of birth — records that are highly protected under federal law and under state law and which state election officials are sworn to protect,” Becker said.
 Sweeping Colorado requests

In Colorado, the amount of data the DOJ wants is enormous. On May 12, Harmeet Dhillon, an assistant U.S. attorney general in the DOJ’s Civil Rights Division, sent a letter to Griswold, the secretary of state, asking for access to “all records” related to the 2024 election.
Federal law requires state election officials to preserve records related to elections for 22 months. Typically, the rule ensures records are preserved in case any lawsuits are filed over an election. In the letter, Dhillon referred to a complaint against Griswold’s office alleging noncompliance with records retention laws, but provided no details.

Experts on election administration who spoke to Stateline expressed shock at the scope of the demand to Colorado. The request encompasses a vast trove of material, potentially including ballots.
“The amount of records being requested from a place like Colorado … it’s really, really significant in terms of the volume of materials that are required to be retained,” said Neal Ubriani, a former voting rights litigator at the DOJ during the Obama and first Trump administrations and the current policy and research director at the nonpartisan Institute for Responsive Government.
Colorado elections have previously drawn Trump’s attention. Former Mesa County Clerk Tina Peters, a staunch Trump supporter, is serving a nine-year prison sentence after a conviction in state court for allowing unauthorized access to voting equipment in 2021.
On May 5 of this year — a week before the Dhillon letter to Griswold — Trump posted on social media that Peters should be released, calling her a “political prisoner.” Griswold noted the timing.
“I think the bigger picture is Donald Trump is continuing to try and rewrite the 2020 election and destabilize the ’26 and ’28 elections,” Griswold told Stateline.

The Colorado Secretary of State’s Office responded to the DOJ by providing copies of the state’s master voter file and voter history file. All of the information provided is also available to the public.
Some Colorado Republican county clerks in recent days have also been approached by Jeff Small, a political operative who worked at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the first Trump administration. Stateline and Colorado Newsline spoke to three GOP clerks who said they had spoken to Small last week.
Steve Schleiker, clerk of El Paso County, which includes Colorado Springs and is the most populous county in the state, said that on July 9 he received a text and call from Small, who introduced himself in a voicemail as someone who “works for the White House.”
Schleiker said that when he called back, Small said he wanted to build relationships with clerks because the Trump administration was unhappy with progress on the president’s elections executive order. He later connected Schleiker with a Homeland Security official who wanted to test the security of El Paso County’s election systems, said Schleiker, who added that he opposed the request.
Weld County Clerk Carly Koppes said she also heard from Small, but that Small told her he wasn’t under contract or being paid for the calls. Small indicated he was making the calls on behalf of former colleagues, Koppes said.
Small, a former Capitol Hill chief of staff who now works for a Colorado-based government affairs firm, didn’t return a call to his office on Wednesday. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that the agency works with local partners to ensure elections remain safe.
“We don’t disclose every single conversation we have with them,” an unidentified DHS spokesperson wrote in an email.
Matt Crane, executive director of the Colorado County Clerks Association, said he was aware of 10 clerks approached by Small. He noted that every clerk approached by Small hails from a county that uses Denver-based Dominion Voting Systems.
While Dominion is widely used in Colorado, it’s also been the subject of election conspiracy theories. A former candidate for county sheriff in southwest Colorado was arrested in June, accused of firebombing a clerk’s office. Colorado Public Radio reported the suspect, according to law enforcement, had spoken publicly about trying to get rid of the county’s Dominion machines.
“I think the really important thing to say here is that it was Republican clerks who stood up to a Republican administration and said, ‘No, we’re going to follow the law,’” Crane said.

The intent of the efforts by Small and the federal government “has been muddied up it seems,” Montrose County Clerk Tressa Guynes said. Based on her conversations with other clerks, she said, it appeared Small represented one thing to other clerks and then “represented maybe a watered-down version by the time it got to me.”
Guynes said Small wanted to discuss Trump’s elections executive order. She said Small asked whether she would be willing to support a federal task force’s efforts in an advisory role.
“I said absolutely I will advise,” Guynes said. “I said I’m frankly glad that they’re finally reaching out to the boots on the ground, the people who actually conduct the elections, instead of listening to those who have never conducted a Colorado election.”
 Letters to other states

As Colorado grapples with the most far-reaching request, other states are choosing how to respond. In Wisconsin, the state election commission responded to a DOJ request for the voter registration list with instructions on how to request public voter data.
Arizona Secretary of State Adrian Fontes, a Democrat, responded on June 2 — after DOJ in a May 20 letter told the state to ensure voter registration applicants provided a driver’s license number, if they have one, instead of a partial Social Security number. The DOJ also wanted Arizona to check voters against a state database to look for noncitizens.
Fontes replied that Arizona complies with federal law and conducts checks using a state motor vehicle division database.
HAVA letter-redacted
“We are focused on dealing with DOJ in a good faith manner while ensuring we are following the letter of federal and state laws,” Fontes spokesperson JP Martin wrote in an email to Stateline.
More recently, Arizona received a letter July 10 from DOJ about implementation of Trump’s elections executive order. Rhode Island Democratic Secretary of State Gregg Amore also received an email about the order the same day, according to a copy provided to the Rhode Island Current. Amore is reviewing the request and has not yet responded, Faith Chybowski, his spokesperson, said Wednesday afternoon.
In the email, Scott Laragy, principal deputy director in the Executive Office for United States Attorneys, asks for a call to discuss a possible information-sharing agreement to provide DOJ with information on individuals who have registered to vote or have voted despite being ineligible, or those who have committed other forms of election fraud.
The email echoes the language in Trump’s elections executive order, which calls for DOJ to reach information-sharing agreements with states. While much of the order, which focused on proof of citizenship in elections, has been struck down in federal court, provisions related to information sharing remain.
The executive order directs Bondi, the U.S. attorney general, to prioritize enforcement of federal “election integrity laws” in uncooperative states. It also requires her to review grants and other DOJ funds that could be withheld from states that resist.
Some states have already struck deals with the Trump administration. Indiana Republican Secretary of State Diego Morales announced an agreement last week with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services allowing the state to access a database to verify the citizenship of registered voters. Alabama Republican Secretary of State Wes Allen has signed a similar agreement.
“With your cooperation, we plan to use this information to enforce Federal election laws and protect the integrity of Federal elections,” Laragy wrote to Rhode Island.

Money for Wyoming’s universal school voucher program will remain in limbo after a Laramie County District Court judge on Tuesday extended his temporary block on the new system.  The controversial program was slated to begin dispersing state funds on July 1 to Wyoming families for non-public school costs like private tuition or tutoring.  In a […]
The post[...]","Money for Wyoming’s universal school voucher program will remain in limbo after a Laramie County District Court judge on Tuesday extended his temporary block on the new system. 
The controversial program was slated to begin dispersing state funds on July 1 to Wyoming families for non-public school costs like private tuition or tutoring. 
In a Tuesday order, Judge Peter Froelicher extended what had been a temporary freeze. His preliminary injunction essentially bars the state from releasing any Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act funds until he determines whether or not the program is constitutional. 
Plaintiffs believe it is plainly not. The Wyoming Education Association, which represents more than 6,000 of the state’s public school employees, and nine parents of school-aged children filed a June 13 lawsuit targeting the program. In it, they argue the program is unconstitutional because it violates constitutional language that allows the state to funnel public funds to private entities only for the necessary support of the poor. But the program’s K-12 component is not limited to low-income residents.
“We’re pleased with the decision,” WEA President Kim Amen said about the Tuesday order. “We filed the injunction because we’re confident that it’s not constitutional.” Because of that, she said, WEA wanted to ensure the state didn’t start down the road of disbursing funds only to have to claw them back or account for them later if the program is found unconstitutional. 
Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Deganfelder, who has championed the voucher program as a major school choice win, expressed regret that the court hold-up has impacted families who already applied and were awaiting funds to pay for textbooks, tutoring or private school uniforms. 
“As one of nearly 4,000 Wyoming families, you have had your lives unnecessarily upended through no fault of your own,” she wrote in a public message, referencing the number of families that have applied since May.  “This constitutional dispute could have been handled in a different way to not cause such harm to you.”

Amen pushed back the narrative that her organization is to blame for hurting families. 
During the heated legislative debate on the vouchers, she said, “everyone was warned that this was likely unconstitutional, or at least pieces of it were unconstitutional. And they went ahead and passed it.”
The lawsuit
The Steamboat Legacy Scholarship Act, which gives funds both to K-12 families and income-qualified pre-K students, comes as a school-choice movement grows nationwide, particularly among conservatives.
Still, it caused a lot of tension in Wyoming’s majority-Republican Legislature as lawmakers grappled with whether or not it adhered to the state’s constitution, which makes public education a paramount state commitment.
Rep. Ocean Andrew, R-Laramie, who sponsored and championed it, called the state’s 2024 education savings account program much too narrow. His 2025 bill transformed that program by stripping income qualifications so the $7,000 would be available to everyone. 
The bill ignited one of the hottest debates of the recent session. It sparked a deluge of feedback, both from supporters of school choice and critics who called it an unconstitutional measure that will erode the quality of public education in Wyoming.

Legislators repeatedly questioned the constitutionality of the expanded program and said they didn’t want to land in court. Others urged the body to hold off and allow the existing ESA program to roll out and work out any bugs before transforming it so drastically. 
But the matter did end up in court, with the lawsuit alleging multiple constitutional violations. It names Degenfelder, along with Wyoming State Treasurer Curt Meier and the state of Wyoming, as defendants. 
The program will negatively impact funding at public schools, according to the lawsuit, because as students leave public schools, districts will lose funding under models that rely on enrollment numbers. The program also lacks transparency and does not hold voucher participants to the state’s established standards and oversight concerning the quality of education provided in public schools, the lawsuit states.
A previous Wyoming Supreme Court ruling on education funding “found that ‘education is a fundamental right’ in Wyoming, that ‘all aspects of the school finance system are subject to strict scrutiny,’ and that ‘any state action interfering with [the right to equal educational opportunity] must be closely examined before it can be said to pass constitutional muster,’” the lawsuit reads.
This voucher program, the lawsuit asserts, does not pass that muster. That’s because “the state cannot circumvent those requirements by funding private education that is not uniform and that meets none of the required state constitutional standards for education.”
The lawsuit asked the court to block the voucher program with a preliminary injunction and find it unconstitutional. 
Plaintiffs met their burden of proof to trigger that injunction, Froelicher ruled Tuesday, and Wyoming will continue to be barred from paying out any funds. Civil cases can take months, or even longer, to be resolved.
WEA called the move “a crucial step in protecting our constitutional promise of a free, fair, and equitable public education for every Wyoming student.”
Degenfelder, meanwhile, said she is working with the attorney general’s office on options for Wyoming to challenge the injunction. “We will continue to keep you apprised of the situation, and I will continue to fight for school choice in Wyoming.”

Police failed to seize several pieces of evidence from Mitchell and mishandled a crowbar that’s the source of one of the felony charges. These mistakes may not amount to much for some jurors, but they only need to find reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s narrative of what happened to find Mitchell not guilty.
“Like with any investigation, are there a few items that you wish we, the state had, or the agency had done differently?” Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald asked Detroit Lakes Police Chief Steven Todd Wednesday.
“Yes,” Todd answered. He added: “I am proud that the officers successfully made that arrest, and the basics of the criminal elements were met in the arrest,” Todd said.
Shortly after Nicole Mitchell’s arrest, Detroit Lakes police officers didn’t retain into evidence at least one item in Nicole Mitchell’s backpack found at the scene of her arrest — a note with scribbles such as “delete texts,” “contacts,” “flashlight,” “ringer off” and “add tracking Gmail.”
The jury was shown an image of the note via bodycam footage from the officer who went through the backpack, but the prosecution didn’t dwell on the note or have officers testify about what it could mean because it wasn’t logged into evidence.
“Would it be fair to say you didn’t understand or didn’t appreciate the significance of this at the time?” McDonald asked Becker County Deputy Sheriff Ethan Wothe, the officer who went through Nicole Mitchell’s backpack. 
He responded: “That would be fair, yes.” 
McDonald: “And it wasn’t retained into evidence?” 
Wothe: “It was not.”
Police mishandled another piece of evidence, this time found on Nicole Mitchell’s person. When Mitchell was booked into jail, police found a pair of black “flashlight gloves” on her — gloves that would give someone ample light if they intended to steal something in the dead of night. Todd testified Wednesday that officers gave the gloves back to Mitchell and didn’t log them into evidence, which he said he now regrets.
In addition, no one searched Nicole Mitchell’s car to see if there was anything taken from the house, nor did anyone apply for a search warrant of her phone to seek additional evidence — more of Todd’s regrets, he said.
Hours after Nicole Mitchell’s arrest, Carol Mitchell called police back to her home because she found a prybar outside an egress window where officers say Nicole Mitchell entered the home.
The prosecutor showed the body cam footage from Wothe, the same officer who went through Nicole Mitchell’s backpack. Wothe jumped down into the egress window well and picked up the blue prybar with his bare hand, according to the body cam footage.
Wothe testified that he knew that was not the best practice, but he was nearing the end of his shift, losing adrenaline and he made a mistake.
During her testimony Tuesday, Carol Mitchell’s description of the prybar was strikingly different from what was shown in court, and she said she didn’t recognize the one in front of her. Carol Mitchell — who her stepdaughter says is suffering from Alzheimer’s disease — struggled to remember details of the alleged break-in and other key events and names.

The prosecution on Wednesday rested its case, and the defense began calling its own witnesses. The defense is trying to make the jurors believe that Nicole Mitchell was concerned about her stepmother’s Alzheimer’s disease and conducting a welfare check after her stepmother didn’t respond to messages for weeks.
The defense has hinted but never confirmed whether Mitchell will testify in her own defense. Nicole Mitchell gave several statements to police after her arrest, like “I know I did something bad”; and “I was just trying to get a couple of my dad’s things.” The defense may call her to explain them.
Bruce Ringstrom Jr., Mitchell’s attorney, said Wednesday that she wants to testify and has sought to tell her story since her arrest.

The U.S. government argues the case should be in a different jurisdiction. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)U.S. District Court Judge Dana Christensen ruled on Tuesday his court does not have jurisdiction over Mexican national Christopher Martinez, who was arrested by Immigration and Customs Officers in Helena, but said his review of the case presents some disconcerting and troubling facts.
One of those issues has been the Helena Police Department officer who originally stopped Martinez because he fit a profile of a Venezuelan national wanted for domestic abuse. But during the stop, body camera footage shows officer Andrew Barton saying while laughing, “He’s being kidnapped right now.”
“OK. Good enough for me,” replied Helena police officer Seth Montgomery.
While Christensen ultimately determined case law and the federal government’s decision to initiate deportation proceedings against Martinez means his fate will be left in the hands of U.S. immigration courts — until a review by a federal appellate court – the judge noted his concern with allegations.
“The court is alarmed that a law enforcement officer would suggest — even in jest — that a ‘kidnapping’ occurred under his watch,” Christensen said.
The release of the body camera footage, along with more details about the case have roiled the Helena community, sparking protests and feedback at public meetings in Montana’s capital city.
In response to the public outcry, Helena Police Chief Brett Petty acknowledged the comment was inappropriate and the department has begun an investigation into the comments. Meanwhile, Lt. Adam Shanks told the Daily Montanan on Wednesday that Montgomery was currently on duty.
“I am incredibly disappointed with the comment that was made. Our leadership team does not believe it is reflective of the department’s involvement in the incident where the remark was captured,” Petty said. “We want to assure the public that any statements or actions that are insensitive or unprofessional are taken seriously and are subject to internal review.”
However, Christensen’s concern extended beyond the Helena Police Department, when the judge noted detention officials with the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff’s Office, which runs the jail, had intentionally denied Martinez’s lawyers access to him while they coordinated with ICE officials to take him in an unmarked van with Washington state plates to an ICE facility in Tacoma, where he is believed to be held, awaiting a hearing on Aug. 19.
When attorneys from Upper Seven Law Firm went to meet with Martinez, they were repeatedly told they could not “facilitate” the meeting because he was not in their custody, even as they watched the van.
“Lt. (Troy) Christensen further stated that he had intentionally prevented the attorneys from meeting with (Martinez) at the direction of ICE,” the court noted.
The Daily Montanan reached out to Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo C. Dutton about the cooperation with ICE and the judge’s decision, but had not received a response on Wednesday.
  Lacks jurisdiction 

Though attorneys for Martinez filed a petition of habeas corpus, a foundational court procedure which challenges the arrest and detention of a person, whether a citizen or not, before a judge, Christensen said U.S. law is clear in that the federal courts in Montana are not the proper venue for Martinez; instead, immigration courts are empowered to decide the case.
In his ruling, Judge Christensen explained that while he found several of the issues raised by Martinez’s attorneys concerning, Congress has specifically given immigration judges power to review those. In addition, immigration courts are subject to a review by federal appeals courts, which means the case could ultimately be reviewed by a federal judge, but not at this stage during the proceedings.
Some of the issues raised by his attorneys include allegations of racial profiling, unlawful search and seizure, as outlined in the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, and whether Martinez could be put in jail for a minor traffic stop in which he ultimately was not cited by the Helena Police Department.
“Any issue ‘arising from any action taken or proceeding brought to remove (an illegal immigrant) from the United States can only be reviewed by the United States Court of Appeals through a petition for review after exhausting the administrative process,” Christensen said, quoting in part directly from federal law. “If the government has initiated removal proceeding, this court lacks jurisdiction over this matter and petitioner’s claims can only be heard, initially, by an immigration judge.”
And the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Montana believes it has enough evidence and history with Martinez it has decided to proceed to deport him, despite his wife telling the media he’s tried repeatedly to go through the naturalization process.
According to court documents, Martinez was returned to Mexico twice in 2007 after entering illegally. In 2021, law enforcement arrested Martinez four times after entering the U.S., and as part of that, he was prohibited from entering the country on a 10-year ban.
Martinez’s attorneys had pointed to other recent immigration cases with U.S. Constitutional concerns as reasons for — and support of — Judge Christensen retaining jurisdiction over the case, but he said those cases were very different. For instance, a First Amendment case in which ICE had rounded up an immigrant in America legally who had spoken out against the U.S. government. He noted in his order that those cases dealt with individuals who had “legal status” to be in the country.
Judge Christensen said while other immigration cases had raised issues of racial profiling, as been brought up in Martinez’s case, he said that immigration judges and appeals courts were also able to address those concerns.
“(Those) reinforce the court’s conclusion that claims of egregious violations in removal cases belong in front of an immigration judge, not a federal district court,” he said. “While the court takes allegations of racial profiling and constitutional violations seriously, (Martinez) cannot bypass the immigration courts and proceed directly to district court. Instead, he must exhaust the administrative process before he can access the federal courts.”
Attorneys with the Upper Seven Law Firm said they plan to appeal the decision to the U.S. Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.
“We’re disappointed in the court’s ruling. The habeas clause of the Constitution is meant to provide relief from unlawful detention by the executive. Deferring to the executive immigration machine under these circumstances contravenes the purpose of the Fourth Amendment and of habeas corpus. We look forward to appealing this decision to the Ninth Circuit,” said Molly Danahy, the Litigation Director for Upper Seven.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)A committee probing alleged antisemitism at Denver’s Auraria Campus heard Wednesday from First Amendment and civil rights scholars, as well as the Anti-Defamation League and members of the public. 
The 10-member Colorado Advisory Committee to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights oversees an investigation into the Auraria Campus, site of the University of Colorado Denver, Community College of Denver and Metropolitan State University of Denver. 
In April 2024, anti-war demonstrators set up an encampment on the Auraria Campus quad, in protest of university policies relating to Israel and the war in Gaza. They called for the university to condemn “the genocidal actions of Israel,” divest from companies that operate in Israel and end study abroad programs in Israel. At least 40 demonstrators were arrested when police in riot gear broke up the encampment.

Susan Rona, of the Anti-Defamation League’s mountain states region, said during the virtual committee hearing that her organization received reports of 279 antisemitic incidents in Colorado in 2024, and 51 of those reports were on college campuses. The statewide tally is 42% higher compared to the previous year.
“Many Jewish students report feeling isolated, targeted and excluded from campus activity and spaces by these protests,” Rona said. 
In response to last year’s anti-war encampments on college campuses across the country, the Trump administration has targeted universities like Harvard and Columbia for antisemitism probes and research funding freezes.
“We must distinguish between protected speech and conduct that violates civil rights, and we must hold our public institutions accountable when they fall short,” Committee Chair Alvina Earnhart said. “This project reflects our deep commitment to safeguarding both civil rights and freedom of expression.”
The committee’s goal with the investigation is to “contribute to more informed approaches to federal, state, and education policy in higher education and develop recommendations” directed to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights and other federal entities.
During the committee meeting, University of Virginia law professor Deborah Hellman outlined the high bar that claims must meet to be considered violations of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act, which the Trump administration has invoked in its crackdown on universities. Title VI prohibits discrimination based on race, color or national origin in programs and activities that receive federal financial assistance.
“Antisemitism, to be sure, ought to be condemned, but universities have a right and a responsibility to balance open inquiry with protecting students,” Hellman said.
Community responses
Brandon Rattiner, the senior director of the Jewish Community Relations Council of Colorado, said in an interview with Colorado Newsline that he hopes the work of the committee can spotlight “the experiences that made life on campus really difficult for Jewish students, and also create pressure for universities to do better.” 
But, he cautioned, the committee should not use campus antisemitism as a way to attack higher education as a whole.
“The challenge is balancing the need to take antisemitism seriously with the need to not instrumentalize the fight against antisemitism to achieve other political aims,” Rattiner said. “The Jewish community is a community that is very committed to higher education, and we want to see it done well.”
About a dozen people gave written or spoken testimony at the hearing, including Jeffrey Mühlrad, who is affiliated with Jewish Voice for Peace and was involved in the encampment.
“We are not calling for divestment out of hatred, but out of love — for human life, for justice, and for the values our institutions claim to uphold,” Mühlrad wrote. “To conflate that call with antisemitism is not only incorrect, but dangerous. It undermines the real fight against antisemitism by weaponizing it to silence legitimate political expression and dissent.”
Nancy Jackson, a Jewish alumna of the University of Colorado system, submitted written testimony to the commission. Jackson, a former teacher, called for the federal government to “uphold the First Amendment rights for everyone, including college students, whether from the U.S., or anywhere.”
“Antisemitism refers to hatred of Jewish people, and as you no doubt know, Jews have been the victims of horrendous acts of violence because of antisemitism,” Jackson wrote. “What we have on campuses today, however, is different. What is occurring is political protest against Israeli policies towards Palestinians, especially in Gaza.”
Since Israel’s intense bombardment and ground invasion of Gaza began after Oct. 7, 2023, when a Hamas-led attack killed more than 1,200 people in Israel, at least 55,100 Palestinians are reported to have been killed, while many more have been injured and face widespread hunger.
The committee’s next public meeting is scheduled for July 31, and its next hearing is scheduled for Aug. 20. Administrators for the three campuses are set to testify during the August hearing.

In what could be the first case in which activists have successfully intervened to stop immigrants in the custody of ICE from being flown out of Vermont, three women escorted by agency officials early Wednesday morning turned around, left the airport and were returned to the jail where they had been held for several days.
This surprising turn of events comes after activists have spent months tracking the transportation of immigrants by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement through Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport and asked local officials to intervene and discontinue cooperation with deportations that have skyrocketed under the second Trump administration. More than 57,800 people were held in ICE custody as of June 29, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data research organization housed at New York’s Syracuse University.
A study the loose group of activists presented to the airport commission in early July showed at least 450 people detained by federal law enforcement in immigration cases have been transferred through Vermont’s largest airport since the start of January.

Lexington Kennedy, a 21-year-old Burlington resident, said they arrived at the airport together with another Burlington activist around 3:50 a.m. to observe the movement of ICE detainees through the airport.
Around 4:15 a.m., the two said they observed a white Sprinter van pull up to the airport with Department of Homeland Security license plates. Around 4:30 a.m. the van doors opened and three plain clothes officials emerged and took three women from the van into the airport. They were joined inside by a fourth plain clothes official, the two activists said.
While the activists said the officials had no identifiers beyond the van that could identify them as ICE agents, VTDigger confirmed that at least two of the three women seen at the airport were in ICE custody and were returned back to Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility. VTDigger was able to confirm these details through information the activists provided, including A numbers — the nine-digit number ICE uses to track detainees — from papers the detainees’ carried. The activists said they obtained the information directly from the detainees in the airport.
People VTDigger interviewed differed in their description as to why the women in ICE custody ended up not boarding the flight. The activists said airline officials turned away the people in ICE custody after being informed their policies allowed them to refuse to board someone on a flight who did not want to go. The activists said they made the case to the airline officials, and the three detainees were visibly crying as they stood at the airline check-in counter.

Vermont immigration advocates intervene at Burlington International Airport
A spokesperson at American Airlines denied it was the company’s decision to keep the ICE officials from boarding a flight with the three women in their custody. Instead, the airline spokesperson said the ICE officials and the three detainees chose not to travel Wednesday morning and that it was not an airline decision. The airline said it could not confirm flight details of the ticketed passengers.
ICE did not return a request for comment. 
While Julie Macuga, a Burlington resident, was not present Wednesday morning, she said she witnessed an earlier transport of seven female ICE detainees through the airport around 4 a.m. on May 30. Macuga also attended the July 3 airport commission meeting where activists encouraged airport staff to make a statement about ICE transportations through the hub. She said the interaction between ICE and activists on Wednesday morning was part of their ongoing work to monitor the transport of people in the custody of ICE at the airport.
“I’m hoping this sets a precedent for airlines at the airport that there is something they can do that’s already in their policies,” Macuga said. 
Macuga said she and other advocates are continuing conversations with local officials like the airport commission to secure a statement describing, or even condemning, the use of the Burlington airport by federal immigration officials.
A video of the incident shared with VTDigger by the activists shows a pair of community members approaching the three women in ICE custody outside the airport and asking in Spanish if they had phone numbers that could be used to contact anyone.
“Nope,” an agent replied, and asked the two activists to back up.
The activists said they had asked the women for their names and emergency contacts before ICE officers stepped in front of them and formed a wall with their arms and bodies. They said the officers told the three detainees not to speak to the advocates.
The activists said two of the detainees provided their A numbers and gave directions on how to reach out to emergency contacts or family members, underscoring a desire by the women to fight back against ICE detention if given a chance, they said.
ICE officials brought the detainees to the American Airlines desk, according to a photograph provided by the activists, who said they witnessed the interaction as they stood to the side. They said airline officials told the group that if the three women were expressing an unwillingness to travel, the airline could not let them on the plane because the airline could be liable. The activists told VTDigger that the ICE agents argued with airline staff before departing the airport with the three women.
The activists declined to name the airline fearing its employees could face retaliation, but flight logs show the flight ICE officials intended to board with the detainees was likely American Airlines 1015 to Washington National airport scheduled to depart at 6:10 am. The activists said ICE agents told them the planned final destination for the three women was Phoenix, Arizona. 
Airport officials said they could not confirm flight details. 
Vermont’s Department of Corrections jail tracking system shows two of the detainees were re-booked at Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility later Wednesday morning, about an hour and a half after they left the detention center.
The two detainees, a 21-year-old and a 28-year-old, were initially booked on July 11. They were released just after 4 a.m. Wednesday and re-booked the same day at around 5:30 a.m. They were released again just after 12:15 p.m., but their current location could not be confirmed. 
Kennedy said they and the other activists who converged at the airport Wednesday are not affiliated with any particular group and were merely  civilians concerned about human trafficking. 
“Our primary objective is to make sure anti-trafficking laws and policies that already exist are being enforced,” Kennedy said. “Ideally that would be the job of somebody at the airport, and until that happens, civilians can and will show up and do that ourselves.”
Nic Longo, aviation director at the Burlington airport, said in an interview Wednesday afternoon that he had heard about the interaction between members of the public and ICE agents, but neither he nor any airport staff were involved. Longo said he was not at the airport at the time. He said it was the first time he has heard of such a situation unfolding at the airport. 
“Interrupting or disturbing our activities is a really, really tough scenario here at the airport,” Longo said.
Asked why airport officials allowed ICE to transport detainees through the airport, Longo said that, “I can’t pick and choose any federal agency that can and cannot access this public use facility,” he said. “It’s no different that I can’t pick and choose which members of the public can use this facility.”
Longo said it is extremely rare for airport staff to interact with any outside agency, including ICE. The airport, which accepts federal grant funding through the Federal Aviation Administration, is obligated to cooperate with the federal government, he said. The funding includes about $30 million in grants the airport will use in fiscal year 2025 and about $180 million the airport will request over the next couple years, Longo said. 
“Our obligation is to cooperate and not impede U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement action,” Longo said.
The activists argued that the fact that ICE is a federal law enforcement agency doesn’t make its actions legal. 
They noted the case of Kseniia Petrova, a genetics researcher at Harvard Medical School, who was detained at the Chittenden Regional Correctional Facility and flown through the Burlington airport this spring before a Vermont judge declared her detention unlawful in May. 
Kennedy said they believe it is the first time the transport of ICE detainees through an airport has been stopped. 
Law enforcement officers, including immigration officials, are supposed to provide detainees with meaningful translation services, notice of their rights and an opportunity to communicate with counsel, said Jill Diaz, executive director of the Vermont Asylum Assistance Project. 
“But what we see in practice is that ICE is moving so quickly and carelessly that we’re seeing people who are getting detained without being charged with an immigration violation,” Diaz said. 
It is not clear how or why the three women were in ICE custody.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Ethics Commission is looking into whether strongly worded communications from the state Attorney General’s Office have negatively impacted commission staff.
The decision follows a July 3 letter addressed to the commission from Attorney General Drew Wrigley that harshly criticized the commission’s recent investigation report on ethics violations by Rep. Jason Dockter, R-Bismarck.
The report said the Attorney General’s Office at times did not cooperate with the investigation and did not turn over some requested records — a characterization Wrigley called “patently false.”
Wrigley said his office gave the commission access to all requested records except when pending investigations and court proceedings prevented them from being turned over.

His letter went on to accuse Ethics Commission Executive Director Rebecca Binstock and her staff of inexperience and poor judgment.
“Ms. Binstock, your report is replete with misleading narratives and omissions, and officials and the public are left having to guess whether your actions are the result of carelessness or the intentional politicization of your office,” Wrigley wrote.
Ethics Commissioner Ward Koeser in a prepared statement he read Wednesday said he felt many of the criticisms were “personal attacks” and out of line, and defended the quality of the report and commission staff.
The Attorney General’s Office in a statement to the Monitor said the comments were made in good faith.
“Our comments have been strictly substantive and focused on constitution, legal and ethical conduct and communications by publicly accountable staff,” the office said Wednesday.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

The Ethics Commission and the Attorney General’s Office have been publicly at odds since the beginning of this year. The Attorney General’s Office raised concerns in testimony to lawmakers that the commission would violate the state constitution if it tried to penalize people who violate ethics laws. The Ethics Commission says the constitution grants it this authority.
Both sides have openly accused one another of unprofessionalism.
“We have felt for some time that we have had a strained relationship with the Attorney General’s Office and we need to find a way to work through that,” Koeser said.
Koeser made a motion Wednesday to appoint a commissioner to evaluate how staff have been treated by the Attorney General’s Office and decide whether to take additional steps to “support a respectful, professional and productive working environment for commission staff.” 
Commissioner Ron Goodman volunteered to take the lead on the matter with help from Commissioner Cynthia Lindquist, who was appointed chair during Wednesday’s meeting
Lindquist suggested reaching out to human resources personnel within the state government first.
“I think we need some advice or guidance from the state personnel office,” she said.

ADDISON — A circle of volunteers appeared from the brush beside a field and slowly converged on a gaggle of Canada geese. They herded them into an enclosure, and the few birds that escaped the roundup were retrieved one by one. 
Canada geese molt their flying feathers in the summer, grounding them for a few weeks. That provides a window for state scientists — and volunteers like those at the Dead Creek Wildlife Management Area recently — to keep tabs on the birds. 
During the season, the state tries to secure identifier bands on 1% of the nesting population of Canada geese, or 300-400 birds, the minimum experts say they need to estimate the population overall.
State officials have hosted a goose-banding day every year at the wildlife area since the 1960s, said biologist Andrew Bouton, who leads the Department of Fish and Wildlife’s migratory game bird efforts.
Data from the event is used to track the nesting population, sex ratios, how many juveniles survive to adulthood and details on birds killed by hunters, he said. 
The volunteers who turned out July 2 for this year’s edition were an eclectic group, wearing everything from head-to-toe camouflage to tie-dyed tank tops and jean shorts.

“I know some of the folks here were hunters,” said David Sausville, who runs wildlife management for the department. “I know a lot of them are families with young kids trying to expose them to it, and then there’s folks that I know that are just straight conservationists, too, that enjoy being out in the land.”
The band is “basically a bracelet,” Bouton said. They aren’t fitted with any electronic trackers, but each has a unique number. Hunters who kill a goose with a band can report the number to a federal database. 
Officials can learn a lot about a goose from its number: when it was banded, how old it was then, if it was recaptured and, as Agency of Natural Resources Secretary Julie Moore said, “a little bit of travel history.” 
The July 2 banding spanned two sites. The 60 or 70 volunteers split into groups and approached the first of what the biologists called the “goose roundup fields” from all sides. Some geese were on a pond nearby, so volunteers in a canoe flushed them out of the water and into the field. The others, already in position on land, herded them into a pen set up earlier.
The sun was hot and a lot of volunteers left early, so it was a smaller group that approached the second site. Carrying portable fencing, they formed a ring just outside the field and, after encircling the geese and guiding them into the right position, constructed a pen around the birds. 
They set up a shade tent, and biologists poured water on the geese to calm  and cool them, Bouton said. 
The geese proved difficult to handle — later, one even escaped from someone’s hold and sprinted away honking.
After the geese were corralled, volunteers carried them to another tent, where experienced banders recorded the sex of each bird and affixed a metal band to their leg with pliers. After all the birds were banded, they were released into the field.

The final tally for the day was 73 new birds and 17 recaptured ones, average numbers for the event, Sausville said.
Vermont Fish and Wildlife keeps a close eye on the state’s Canada geese because the population is young — and exists largely because of human intervention. Dead Creek Visitor Center manager Amy Alfieri said the nesting population, including the birds banded at this year’s event, descends from geese in a decades-old program at Dead Creek. 
In 1956, the state trapped 44 Canada geese, clipped their wings, then released them into a 70-acre enclosed area around the creek. By 1960, they were nesting. Canada geese have strong homing instincts and usually return to the place they were born to raise young. Now around 300 goslings are born in the Dead Creek area each year. 
Once the nesting population was established, more migrating geese started to stop by Dead Creek. Between 2,000 and 5,000 migratory Canada geese come to the area each fall, according to the state.
And it is no accident. “The area was designed as basically a waterfowl management production area,” Sausville said. In the ’50s, dams were built with mechanisms to control water levels and used to create open water and wetland habitats, he said. 
At the time, a lot of Vermont’s wildlife was threatened, and there was a push to re-forest the land and bring birds — particularly game species — back in. 
Much of the work at Dead Creek was done by World War II veterans, who had developed engineering and construction skills in the military or studied conservation on the GI bill, said Sausville.

“This is the original wetland creation story in Vermont,” Moore said. 
Water levels in the area are periodically lowered to expose mudflats and allow plants to grow. The areas are flooded again, and the plants provide a food source for waterfowl, said Alfieri. 
Some fields in the management area are leased to farmers who grow food like corn and alfalfa, which help attract waterfowl, she said. 
The state’s target nesting population of Canada geese is 24-25,000 birds, Sausville said. 
That number is based on what the environment can handle but also on what he called Vermont’s “cultural carrying capacity,” or how many geese humans are willing to coexist with. 
“I’m sure that the biological carrying capacity is actually higher than that, and the landscape could hold more of them,” he said.  
Dead Creek Wildlife Management Area is about 3,000 acres, and 400 of those serve as a refuge, meaning no hunting is allowed and no one can go inside. But there are five hunting blinds in other parts of the area that allow hunting on a limited basis.
Controlled hunting has been allowed in Dead Creek since 1974. Permits are available through a lottery for several days in October and November. Limits for how many geese can be shot per day are announced each year.

“We’ve been consistently right around 7,000 waterfowl hunters statewide for many years,” Sausville said. 
Doug Smith of Addison, who came to the July 2 event, is one of them. He has been hunting in Vermont since the 1970s, both within and outside of the Dead Creek area. He said he’s been a regular at the event over the years. Many of the state workers there seemed to know him.
“The trouble is, if you hunt the same area quite often, the geese aren’t going to go there anymore,” he said, explaining his strategy of rotating to different hunting spots. “They’re not dumb.”
Part of the state’s continued focus on the Dead Creek area is due to its role within the Lake Champlain flyway, Moore said. That’s a section of the larger Atlantic Flyway, the path most birds take when migrating along the East Coast. Moore said her agency has used money from the Environmental Protection Agency to buy poor farmland and convert it to wetland habitat for migratory birds. 
The end goal, she said, is creating a connected block of protected habitat in the Otter Creek watershed, of which Dead Creek is a part.
“Projects that are at the intersection of some of our water quality goals for Lake Champlain and create habitat is this serendipitous win-win,” Moore said.

(Jeff Beach/North Dakota Monitor)The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday put a temporary freeze on North Dakota’s legislative district map, keeping it in place pending next steps in a tribal voting rights case against the state.
The move came just a day before the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals was expected to issue a mandate officially reversing a North Dakota federal judge’s decision and ordering the lawsuit to be dismissed. That would have resulted in North Dakota reverting back to a previous district map that two tribal nations and a group of tribal citizens took the state to court to change.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal members filed the lawsuit in 2022, alleging that North Dakota’s 2021 redistricting map was discriminatory and diluted the power of Indigenous voters.
North Dakota tribes ask Supreme Court to keep legislative districts intact amid lawsuit

North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 sided with the plaintiffs and ordered the state to adopt a different map, but the 8th Circuit reversed his decision in May. The appellate court ruled that private citizens cannot file lawsuits under Section 2 of the federal Voting Rights Act, which outlaws racially discriminatory voting practices.
The plaintiffs are getting ready to petition the Supreme Court to review the lawsuit. On Tuesday, they filed a motion asking the court to allow Welte’s map to stay in place while the case plays out.
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to an initial, more limited element of that request on Wednesday. Under the high court’s administrative stay, the map will remain unchanged for now. The justices will later decide whether it’s necessary to put a longer-term hold on the district map until a final decision in the case is reached.
The high court on Tuesday asked the state to file its response to the plaintiffs’ motion by July 22. North Dakota has maintained that the 2021 map is not discriminatory and that it agrees with the 8th Circuit’s finding that the tribes lack standing to sue.
The plaintiffs’ deadline to file their official petition asking the Supreme Court to take the case is in October.
In a Tuesday filing, the plaintiffs argued the 8th Circuit’s decision severely damaged voting rights in the circuit’s seven states. The 8th Circuit is the only one to hold that private plaintiffs cannot file voting discrimination claims under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. 
The plaintiffs also said that allowing North Dakota’s 2021 map to go back into effect would harm Native American voters as well as potentially unseat three lawmakers.
Welte’s map, adopted in 2024, changed District 9 to include two reservations. In the 2024 election, three Native American candidates from that district were elected to the state Legislature: Sen. Richard Marcellais and Rep. Jayme Davis — both citizens of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa — and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit. All three are Democrats.
If the 2021 map is reinstated, three lawmakers would change districts, including Brown. Attorneys for the North Dakota Legislature have said the lawmakers could be subject to removal from office, since the state constitution requires lawmakers to live in the districts they represent.
The 8th Circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.

Fred Eshelman’s petition for high-court review asserts that 10th Circuit victory for hunters and the public to access public land constitutes an unconstitutional taking of private property.
The post Ranch owner asks Supreme Court to decide corner crossing’s legality, says lower court ‘inverted’ law appeared first on WyoFile .","Elk Mountain Ranch owner Fred Eshelman on Wednesday petitioned the U.S. Supreme Court to review a lower court decision that corner crossing is not trespassing. The filing asserts that the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals “inverted” legal limits on the federal government that are meant to keep it from trammeling state trespass statutes.
The long anticipated appeal pits Eshelman against four Missouri hunters — Bradly Cape, Zachary Smith, Phillip Yeomans and John Slowensky — who passed through the airspace above Elk Mountain Ranch property to hunt on public land beyond. By corner crossing, they did not set foot on the land itself.
“The [10th Circuit] decision … steamrolls state law, takes easements, and revolutionizes property law affecting up to 150 million acres of private land,” Eshelman’s attorneys state in their petition. The decision has “already created confusion about the new legal landscape,” the petition states.
“Under the Tenth Circuit’s rationale, the UIA necessarily permits the public to access public land even if it requires trekking through dozens of miles of private land.”Fred Eshelman’s petition
WyoFile obtained the petition from the hunters’ attorney. It had not been posted to the Supreme Court’s website by 4:55 p.m. Wednesday.
The case has implications for public access to public land across the West and, according to the petition, throughout the entire country.
Corner crossing is the act of stepping from one piece of public property to another at the common corner with two pieces of private property, all arranged in a checkerboard pattern of land ownership. Corner crossing does not involve setting foot on private land but necessarily requires passing through the airspace above it.
Eshelman contends that passing through that airspace constitutes a trespass and is illegal.
Eshelman sued the four hunters in 2023 after they corner crossed to hunt public land surrounded by his wildlife-rich private property. That public land was inaccessible without trespassing, corner crossing or flying.
But the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in March upheld Wyoming’s Chief U.S. District Court Judge Scott Skavdahl’s finding that the hunters did not trespass.

“In addition to erasing billions of dollars in private property value, the decision … will lead to widespread trespasses and property damage,” Eshelman’s 33-page petition states. The 10th Circuit ruling “leaves tens of millions of outdoor recreationists in limbo about how and where they may access public land.”
Supreme Court review would provide “a unique and timely opportunity to provide immediate and much-needed clarity to landowners, recreationists, and public authorities alike,” Eshelman attorneys Samuel Callahan, R. Reeves Anderson and Brian M. Williams state in the petition.
Federal, state laws conflict
The hunters will have an opportunity to respond, and Eshelman yet another chance to rebut that before the petition is distributed to the justices. The court could decide early this fall whether to issue a writ of certiorari commanding the case to be turned over to their jurisdiction.
Other filings and arguments would ensue should the Supreme Court accept the case.
In deciding in favor of the hunters, the 10th Circuit relied on the 1885 Unlawful Inclosures Act that prohibits fencing off and blocking public access to public land in the West. Congress passed it to resolve conflicts in the checkerboard landscape, an ownership pattern created by the government during the railroad construction and land grant era of the 1800s.

Hunters’ attorney Ryan Semerad successfully argued that the act and subsequent court cases prohibited Eshelman from blocking public access to public land, even through threats and intimidation. The hunters did not seek an easement at the corners they crossed. Instead they defended their actions by asserting Eshelman could not prohibit their access, even by filing a lawsuit that seeks to bar them and others from corner crossing.
Eshelman, a wealthy North Carolina pharmaceutical magnate, contests that notion.
The 10th Circuit improperly decided the federal act preempted Wyoming trespass law, Eshelman’s filing contends. There’s a “presumption against preemption” — a presumption that federal law shouldn’t easily overrule a state law — the ranch owner contends.
“The Tenth Circuit inverted the presumption against preemption,” the petition states. “The premise underlying this conclusion was that a state-law trespass action can constitute a ‘nuisance,’ which in turn can be understood as an unlawful ‘inclosure.’

Corner-crossing hunters’ attorney Ryan Semerad addresses the jury in the hunters’ criminal trial in Rawlins in 2023. (Angus M. Thuermer, Jr./WyoFile)
“[A] trespass action is neither unlawful nor an ‘inclosure,’ in its 1885 or present-day sense,” Eshelman argues. “Nor can asserting a valid trespass action under state law constitute a ‘nuisance’; to counsel’s knowledge, the Tenth Circuit is the first court to so hold.”
The 10th Circuit decision extends beyond checkerboard corners, the petition states.
“Under the Tenth Circuit’s rationale, the UIA necessarily permits the public to access public land even if it requires trekking through dozens of miles of private land,” Eshelman’s lawyers state.
Chaos could follow if the 10th Circuit ruling stands, the filing contends. In searching for a corner, even with GPS technology on a cellphone, “a corner crosser will already have trespassed multiple times,” the filing states.
The 10th Circuit ruling “also means that members of the public, some with high-powered rifles, will roam freely within the perimeter of checkerboard owners’ land without notifying anyone of their presence.”
Taking of private property?
Eshelman’s ranch spans more than 20,000 acres and is home to hundreds of elk, plus other wildlife. A hunter himself, Eshelman and his guests would have exclusive access to some 6,000 acres of public land if corner crossing is deemed an illegal trespass.
Similar situations exist in other locations across the West. The group Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, which supported Cape and his partners, contends that private landowners in such locations control for their exclusive use land that belongs to all Americans.
Eshelman’s petition makes numerous other points, including that the UIA refers to physical barriers like fences, ditches, cattle guards and so-on. It says the 10th Circuit interpretation of the UIA effects “an unconstitutional taking” of private property because the landowner is not compensated.
The petition argues that in a case known as Leo Sheep the Supreme Court decided against the federal government having any kind of easement across corners. “The relevant question in Leo Sheep was not about how the public accessed the land but whether the government had an access right at all,” the petition states.
Hunters’ attorney Semerad said in a statement that the Supreme Court does not need to hear the case.
“But if it chooses to, it should do so to announce — once and for all — that private landowners cannot prevent the public from lawfully accessing public land … just as every other judge who has heard this case has decided.
“We are ready to defend those correctly decided lower-court decisions to protect the rights of all Americans to access their public lands,” his statement reads.

At right is Commissioner Jonathan Williams. (Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ State Board of Election Commissioners voted Wednesday to reprimand and decertify a poll supervisor accused of violating state election laws at a North Arkansas polling place last year.
The board determined that Kay Holland interfered with poll workers’ ability to do their jobs at a Horseshoe Bend church that served as a voting site in October and November 2024.
Testimony from Holland, Izard County Election Commissioner David DelVecchio and several poll workers led the elections board to conclude Holland violated the law by creating a “hostile” environment, telling workers to leave the polling place at an inappropriate time and failing to remove obstacles to poll watchers’ view of the site in a timely manner.
Poll watchers are assigned by local elected officials to monitor the casting and tabulation of ballots. Unlike other poll workers, they do not interact with voters or handle ballots.
Poll watcher Patricia Clary said an accordion wall in the church partially blocked poll watchers’ view of a vote tabulator machine and the poll supervisor’s desk.
DelVecchio testified on Holland’s behalf and said he took responsibility for the obstruction.
“Once we opened that up, the whole room was visible,” he said. “It wasn’t intentional to block somebody’s view. When we walked into the church, that’s where [the wall] was.”
Commissioner Bilenda Harris-Ritter said Holland and DelVecchio shared responsibility for the problem. She reminded the commission that Arkansas law requires poll watchers to have “uniform and nondiscriminatory access to observe all stages of the election process.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Another poll watcher, Frances Petersen, said Holland directed her to sit in an area where she could not see the supervisor’s desk and accused her and Clary of being “argumentative” by questioning Holland’s orders.
Petersen said Holland spoke to her “like a school kid.” Holland disputed this.
“At no time was I talking to them like they were schoolchildren,” she said. “I was not disrespectful. I just told her there was an area that was designated for poll watchers, and everybody else had always sat there and was fine, no problem.”
Testimony of Holland’s “hostile” behavior “outweighs her statement that she didn’t feel like she was being hostile,” Harris-Ritter said.
“Although she did say she didn’t intend to, intent has nothing to do with the violations here,” she said.
The State Board of Election Commissioners certifies poll supervisors, and most of the board voted to strip Holland of her certification for four years and send her a letter of reprimand.
James Harmon Smith was the only commissioner to vote against these actions. He said he had no problem with the letter of reprimand but objected to a four-year ban on Holland’s position as a poll supervisor since she had no previous sanctions from the commission.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kay-Holland-scaled-e1752708207422-1024x717.jpg,,,2025-07-16 20:06:01.267686

Free.,Advocates for immigrants sue to stop courthouse ICE arrests,Ariana Figueroa,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/advocates-immigrants-sue-stop-courthouse-ice-arrests,,"WASHINGTON — Immigration advocacy groups sued the Trump administration Wednesday for dismissing cases in immigration courts in order to place immigrants in expedited removal for swift deportations without judicial review.As the White House aims to achieve its goals of deporting 1 million immigrants without permanent legal status by the end of the year and a 3,000 arrests-per-day quota for Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, immigrants showing up to court appearances have been arrested or detained.President Donald Trump’s administration has moved to reshape immigration court, which is overseen by the Department of Justice, through mass firings of judges hired during President Joe Biden’s term and pressuring judges to clear the nearly 4 million case backlog.The suit was brought in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia by immigration legal and advocacy groups the National Immigrant Justice Center, Democracy Forward, Refugee and Immigrant Center for Legal Education and Services and the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights of the San Francisco Bay Area.The suit is a proposed class action representing 12 immigrants who filed asylum claims or other types of relief and had their cases dismissed and placed in expedited removal, subjecting them to a fast-track deportation. The individual plaintiffs, who all have pseudonyms in the court documents, had their asylum cases dismissed and were arrested and placed in detention centers far from their homes.One plaintiff, E.C., fled Cuba after he was arrested and raped after he opposed that country’s government. He came to the U.S. in 2022 and applied for asylum and appeared for an immigration hearing in Miami.At his hearing, DHS attorneys moved to dismiss his case “without notice and without articulating any reasoning whatsoever” and when he tried to leave the court, ICE arrested and detained him, according to the suit.E.C. is currently detained in Tacoma, Washington, “thousands of miles from his family, including his U.S. citizen wife,” according to the suit.New policiesThe groups argue new policies from the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Justice are unlawful.Those policies include the approval of civil arrests in immigration court, instructing ICE prosecutors to dismiss cases without following proper procedure, instructing ICE agents to put immigrants who have been in the country for more than two years in expedited removal and pursuing expedited removal when removal cases are ongoing.“(DHS) has now adopted the policy that it will arrest a noncitizen and place them in expedited removal even if the immigration judge does not immediately grant dismissal or if the noncitizen reserves appeal of the dismissal—either of which means that the full removal proceedings are not over,” according to the suit. “In plain terms, DHS is disregarding both immigration judges who permit noncitizens an opportunity to oppose dismissal and the pendency of an appeal of the dismissal decision.”The Trump administration has expanded the use of expedited removal, meaning that any immigrant without legal status who’s been in the U.S. for less than two years can be swiftly deported without appearing before an immigration judge.“DHS and DOJ have implemented their new campaign of courthouse arrests through coordinated policies designed to strip noncitizens of their rights … exposing them to immediate arrest and expedited removal,” according to the suit.The impact has been “severe,” according to the suit.“Noncitizens, including most of the Individual Plaintiffs here, have been abruptly ripped from their families, lives, homes, and jobs for appearing in immigration court, a step required to enable them to proceed with their applications for permission to remain in this country,” according to the suit.Detained immigrants’ storiesThe suit details the plaintiffs’ circumstances.One known as M.K., appeared in immigration court for her asylum hearing after she came to the U.S. in 2024 from Liberia, fleeing an abusive marriage and after she endured female genital mutilation.DHS attorneys dismissed “her case without notice and, upon information and belief, without articulating any change in circumstances,” according to the suit.“M.K. speaks a rare language, and because the interpretation was poor, she did not understand what was happening at the hearing,” according to the suit. “M.K. was arrested by ICE at the courthouse and detained; she was so distressed by what happened that she required hospitalization.”She is currently detained in Minnesota. Another asylum seeker, L.H., came to the U.S. in 2022 from Venezuela, fleeing from persecution because of her sexual orientation, according to the suit. At her first immigration hearing in May, DHS moved to dismiss her case and has received an expedited removal notice.ICE officers arrested L.H. after she had her hearing and she is currently detained in Ohio.",,,,2025-07-16 20:06:01.267686

‘Pegged attractors’ on fly fishing leaders, which caught on in the last decade, will no longer be allowed in Gray Reef and Cardwell sections of the popular fishery.
The post On the North Platte, where anglers maim 1 in 4 trout, Wyoming goes barbless, bans some bead rigs appeared first on WyoFile .","Research has translated into regulation on the North Platte River, a famous central Wyoming tailwater where up to a quarter of trout have sustained hook-related injuries to their gills, body cavity or eyes severe enough to be lethal. 
On Wednesday, the Wyoming Game and Fish Commission agreed to proposed regulation changes designed to help brown, rainbow and cutthroat trout survive the swarms of flies and lures that besiege the world-renowned commercial fly fishing destination every year. 
Only single barbless hooks will be allowed in the future along all four North Platte River sections downstream from Seminoe Reservoir. Additionally, fixing egg patterns and other attractants to lines above hooks — a setup known as “pegged attractors” — will no longer be permitted on the river’s Cardwell and Gray Reef sections. (They’ll still be allowed on the Miracle Mile and Afterbay stretches, where bait will also remain legal.)
Pegged attractors, illustrated on the left, are an egg pattern that pulls a hook into a fish’s head upon a hook set. Although they’ve gained popularity, they’re being prohibited on two stretches of the North Platte River because of a suspected connection to hooking injuries. (WGFD)

“We’re concerned that the advent of this technique overlaps with the appearance of these more massive and severe injuries,” Mark Smith, Game and Fish’s fisheries management coordinator, told members of the commission at a Casper meeting. 
The technique, which some anglers consider snagging, has caught on in the last decade and often hooks fish in the jaw or elsewhere on their face, instead of their mouths, where an ordinary fly would catch. 
Fishing with a “pegged attractor” is already considered illegal in Wyoming when there’s more than two inches separating the bead and hook.

The scientific evidence is lacking that “pegged attractors” are a chief culprit in the North Platte’s mangled trout, Smith said. But Wyoming Game and Fish biologists will soon know if the new equipment standards are successfully preventing hooking injuries. Anglers catch more trout annually (about 50,000) between Gray Reef and Robertson Road than exist in the river (30,000 estimate), which means the same fish are being caught repeatedly. 
“We do annual population monitoring on all of these reaches of the river, and we’ve incorporated an assessment of hooking injuries,” Smith told WyoFile. “So we’ll continue to be tracking that. Over time, hopefully we’ll begin to see some improvements here in the next few years as the new regulations are adopted.”
Meantime, there’s concern that anglers are hurting their own cause by severely and lethally injuring so many fish, even while practicing catch-and-release, that they’re ultimately suppressing populations.

The North Platte’s fly fishing outfitters are welcoming the stiffened regulations. Blake Jackson, who owns the Ugly Bug Fly Shop, believes that the barbless hook requirement is going to be the real difference maker, but he also welcomed a partial prohibition on “pegged attractors.”
“I think every little bit helps,” Jackson said. “But by no means do I think this is going to solve the issue.” 
Hooking injuries, he said, can also be driven by water clarity issues tied to sediment loads related to the soil in the region. 
“In years that all the traffic is reduced to an 8- or 10-mile stretch of clean water,” Jackson said, “that’s when these [hooking injury] issues start popping up.”

With wading anglers in mind, the Game and Fish Commission on Wednesday also OK’d a change to where boats are permitted on one 3-mile section of the North Platte. Watercraft will no longer be allowed on the stretch of the Miracle Mile between Kortes Dam and the Seminoe Road bridge.  
There’s a long way yet to go, but regulatory changes could also be coming to commercial guiding on the North Platte. It’s one of the fisheries, after many years of effort, that sparked legislation enabling Game and Fish to regulate commercially guided fishing boats.
Jackson is on the working group that helped generate draft regulations that are open to public comment through July 31. The first step in those regulations, he said, is a requirement for commercial guides and outfitters to register with Game and Fish and acquire a commercial boat license. That will provide data that could inform further regulation, like prospective limits on professional guiding.  
“We really don’t have the data needed to diagnose what waterways might need further regulation or restricted permits,” Jackson said. “We need the data before we can take that next step.”

The State Board of Education cited the upcoming work to craft new school district boundaries when denying Paine Mountain Valley School District’s request for a majority of seats on a shared supervisory union's board.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  A political row between two central Vermont school districts foreshadows challenges ahead for new redistrict[...]","The State Board of Education heard arguments from a central Vermont school district Wednesday about why its larger size should grant it a greater number of board seats on a shared supervisory union’s governing board. The debate foreshadowed tensions that could broaden in the coming months as state officials work to craft larger, consolidated school districts. 
The political row before the state board pits the Paine Mountain and Echo Valley school districts against each other. Each district serves students from two towns and both are under the umbrella of the Central Vermont Supervisory Union.
Supervisory unions function as administrative superstructures that allow otherwise distinct member school districts to share services. 
In November of last year, a majority of board members in the Paine Mountain district voted to request that the state Board of Education rework the number of seats allotted to each district on the supervisory union’s board to give them a clear majority.
Both districts now have three seats on the union’s six-person board, but officials with the Paine Mountain district argue it should be changed to more accurately represent each district’s overall resident and student population.
The Paine Mountain School District operates four schools for the towns of Northfield and Williamstown, which have an overall resident population of roughly 6,000 and 3,500, respectively. The Echo Valley School District, meanwhile, operates two schools in Washington and Orange. Both towns each have populations of just over 1,000.
Dan Morris, the chair of the Paine Mountain district’s board, told state Board of Education members Wednesday that his district serves 80% of the students in the supervisory union while Echo Valley serves only 20%.
He said the arrangement has created an imbalance in the supervisory union, and in a letter to the state board of education wrote that their current designation “does not provide adequate representation for the students and taxpayers it serves.”
During Wednesday’s meeting, Morris pointed to the supervisory union’s recent hiring of a new superintendent as evidence of the imbalance. The 3-3 voting split on the board, he said, was “unduly magnifying Echo Valley’s voice and diminishing Paine Mountain’s.”
Morris said during the meeting meeting that this, and other issues arising out of the imbalance, were “pretty distressing for people in our two towns.”
He asked the board to consider changing the proportion to a 4-2 split, or adding seats to the board to create a 5-3 split, with the majority of voting members allotted to the Paine Mountain district.
Echo Valley School District officials disagreed. 
In a letter included in the board’s June meeting minutes, Michael Concessi, a current member of both the Central Vermont Supervisory Union and Echo Valley School District boards, wrote to state Board of Education members that Paine Mountain’s proposal sends a clear message that large districts can overpower smaller ones, which could lead to mistrust and threaten collaboration.
On Wednesday, Matthew Flinn, chair of the Central Vermont Supervisory Union board, asked the state board to deny their request.
“This petition is the first of its kind in Vermont. Whatever you decide will set a precedent, not only for supervisory unions statewide, but also for the redistricting committee’s work ahead,” he said.
The State Board of Education moved to deny the Paine Mountain district’s petition. But the issue highlights broader questions around proportional representation as the state will soon begin work to overhaul the educational landscape. While school districts are required to allot representation on governing boards proportionally based on population, the same is not true of supervisory unions. 
The School Redistricting Task Force, the body tasked under H.454 — now Act 73 — plans to meet for the first time within roughly the next two weeks, on or around Aug. 1. The body is charged with designing new school district boundaries for the state’s public education system.

Members on that task force will almost certainly be faced with questions about the role of supervisory unions and how they should be governed as they aim to consolidate Vermont’s 119 school districts — contained within the 52 supervisory districts or supervisory unions — into anywhere from 10 to 25 future districts.
The new education reform law requires at least one of the new district maps the Legislature will consider next year include supervisory unions. Some advocates believe that administrative structure is important to allow private schools to continue educating public school students from communities with which they have historic ties.
While that task force proceeds, the School District Voting Ward Working Group, set to first meet by Oct. 1, will begin creating voting wards for the new school districts as soon as possible — depending on what the task force has accomplished.
That group will eventually make recommendations to the Legislature for how to draw voting districts within each new school district “that are compact, contiguous, and drawn to achieve substantially equal weighting of votes” while meeting other state and federal requirements, according to Act 73.
State Board of Education members pointed to this uncertainty in moving to unanimously deny the Paine Mountain district’s request.
Jennifer Samuelson, chair of the state board, noted after the vote that the upcoming work of the redistricting task force “does give me pause about the board sort of stepping into waters where borders are being shifted in real time, potentially.”
The division highlighted what could be a difficult balancing act for the state’s recently constituted task force crafting new school districts.
In his argument Wednesday, Morris, Paine Mountain district chair, pointed to five other supervisory unions in Vermont that allot board seats to member districts in proportion with student population.
The list includes the Lamoille North Supervisory Union, which Morris said gives 13 seats to the Lamoille North school district, and six seats to the Cambridge School District.
Other districts, including the Bennington-Rutland, Windham Central, Windham Southeast and Windsor Southwest supervisory unions, also allot their members’ board seats based on population, Morris said.
“These examples show that reconstituting the (supervisory union) board to be a more proportionate reflection of the students served would not make our (supervisory union) an outlier,” he said. “Many other (supervisory union’s) already take this same approach.”
This line of thinking goes against the intent of laws governing supervisory unions and supervisory districts, Flinn and other Echo Valley district officials said.
“Equity in representation does not always mean proportionality — it means ensuring that both districts have meaningful input into shared governance,” Dominique LaFond-Copeland, the chair of the Echo Valley district, wrote to the state Board of Education. “In this case, equal representation has yielded effective collaboration and should be preserved.”
Many other Vermont supervisory unions, including the Rutland Northwest, Two Rivers and Windham Northeast supervisory unions, she wrote, maintain equal board representation despite unequal district sizes.
Board members, in discussion, were cautious about making changes to a supervisory union that they said appears to be functioning well — that is, aside from this political squabble.
The board, in its motion, left open the possibility of returning to the request at a later time. But members said now was not the right time for such a change.
“I would hate to do something now and then have to undo a change that we might make just because there’s going to be another change that needs to happen,” state Board of Education member Lyle Jepson said on Wednesday. “That does not make sense to me at all.”

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota-based Prairie Public Broadcasting may look and sound different over the next 12 months if Senate lawmakers proceed with expected funding cuts.
John Harris, president of Prairie Public, said Wednesday he is pessimistic about federal funds continuing to flow to PBS and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting after Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote to advance a bill that claws back previously approved funding.
“It’s just a high potential that we’re going to take a significant hit,” Harris said. He said the elimination of the federal funds adds up to about $2 million of Prairie Public’s budget over the next two years.

Federal funding for three North Dakota tribal radio stations also was at risk, but a deal announced late Tuesday would set aside funds for some Native American radio stations.
Prairie Public has been saving money to blunt the impact of the federal budget cuts, Harris said. Potential changes to programming, staff and facilities may happen more gradually over the next year. 
“Everything is on the table for consideration of what to do to balance the budget,” he said. 
Harris said losing Prairie Public broadcasting coverage in rural parts of the state would be an “extreme” and he believes the organization would do everything it could to preserve its coverage area across North Dakota and western Minnesota.
North Dakota Sens. John Hoeven and Kevin Cramer were among Republican senators who voted yes to begin debate on the bill that would cancel $9 billion in funding for and public broadcasting several foreign aid programs.
“There’s a strong feeling that they should get their funding privately, like the other broadcasters do,” Hoeven said after a news conference last week in Bismarck.
Cramer said there may have been a time when Prairie Public needed federal funding to stay afloat, but he thinks that time has “long passed.”
North Dakota U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak, also a Republican, previously supported the bill.

“Public funds should support core national interests — not subsidize biased messaging or unaccountable programs,” Fedorchak said in a statement last month.
State lawmakers also took aim at public broadcasting funds this year. Gov. Kelly Armstrong included $2.9 million in funding for Prairie Public in his budget proposal for 2025-27, including $1.7 million in one-time funding for transmitter maintenance. However, that funding was reduced to $400,000.
Native American radio stations
As the U.S. Senate voted late Tuesday to advance the bill, South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds announced an agreement that would continue to fund some Native American radio stations, States Newsroom reported.
The agreement with White House budget director Russ Vought would move $9.4 million from an account within the Interior Department to Native American radio stations in North Dakota and 10 other states, according to Rounds’ office.
The budget request for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting lists three North Dakota Native American radio stations serving the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, the Mandan, Hidatsa and Arikara Nation and the Spirit Lake Nation.

Federal funding makes up a large share of the budget for KEYA, the public radio station that serves the Turtle Mountain Reservation, said program director Jarle Kvale. 
The Corporation for Public Broadcasting requested that KEYA receive $222,675 in federal money.
Kvale said “it would be difficult to survive” without that funding.
He described KEYA as an “old school” radio station that serves the Turtle Mountain community by broadcasting tribal council meetings, public service announcements and weather forecasts, among other news. 
The station turns 50 years old in October. Kvale has been working there for 31 years, he said. 
Cutting public broadcasting funding for tribal radio stations would be “devastating to Indian Country,” said Nicole Donaghy, executive director of North Dakota Native Vote.
“In rural communities, tribal radio is often the only trusted source for culturally relevant content, emergency alerts, civic updates and language revitalization,” Donaghy said in a Wednesday statement.

Vermonters overwhelmingly voted to enshrine reproductive rights in the state constitution in 2022. But what if those rights — to abortion, birth control and other reproductive health services — are nearly impossible to access?
Putting care out of reach appears to be the strategy behind the Trump administration’s relentless assault on Planned Parenthood, the nation’s largest provider of reproductive health care. President Trump’s “big beautiful bill” that he signed into law on July 4 includes a provision to defund Planned Parenthood and other organizations that provide abortions. A federal judge has temporarily blocked this provision, but if the Trump administration prevails, Planned Parenthood says that numerous health care centers may close, mostly in states where abortion remains legal.
This compounds a problem in Vermont, since half of Planned Parenthood’s clinics in the state have closed in the last three years due to an ongoing financial crisis with Planned Parenthood of Northern New England (PPNNE).
Medicaid already bans funding for abortions. Most of Planned Parenthood’s Medicaid patients who obtain family planning services receive birth control and STI testing. One in four Planned Parenthood patients in Vermont and Maine are insured by Medicaid, and one in five in New Hampshire.
“The absurdity of all of this is just so transparent,” Nicole Clegg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, told The Vermont Conversation. “We have long-lasting relationships with our patients. We could be their main provider for years … and to suddenly be told, ‘Sorry, you can’t go to that provider anymore because they also provide abortion care’ — that’s what’s happening here. That’s the goal.”
Clegg emphasized that “the overwhelming majority of what we’re providing to patients are disease testing and treatment, cancer screenings, wellness exams, birth control. Those are the primary needs that people have during their reproductive years.”
Abortion opponents are “no longer interested in the states where they’ve been successful in banning abortion. They’re now really focused on the states where abortion is still legal, so that includes Vermont, and what they’re trying to do is go after providers. So that’s the new tactic,” Clegg said.
She noted that people seeking an abortion in states where it is banned are increasingly coming to New England for care. She told the story of a couple seeking an abortion who drove from Oklahoma to Vermont “because they felt like that was going to be the safest option for them.”
“We live in an area of the country where we are a little bit insulated from this fear, but this fear is very real.”

What is motivating the attacks?
“It’s about abortion. It’s about controlling people and their ability to make decisions and decide when to have a family,” Clegg replied.
A 2024 Pew survey found that two out of three Americans – and 79% of Vermonters – believe that abortion should be legal in all or most cases.
“We needed to sort of wake people up by having them lose these basic rights. That’s where we are right now.”
One in three women have received care from Planned Parenthood in their lifetime, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. 
“There’s just no other healthcare provider in our country that has that kind of reach and impact,” Clegg said.
I asked Clegg what a world without Planned Parenthood would look like. She cited research on what has happened in areas where a Planned Parenthood health center has closed.
“Worse pregnancy outcomes. Increased rates of cancer. Increased rates of unintended pregnancy. Untreated sexually transmitted diseases. Increased rates of HIV and AIDS.”
Will Planned Parenthood survive?
Clegg noted that this year marks Planned Parenthood’s 60th anniversary. “We have touched the lives of more than a million people” in northern New England, she said. 
“I fundamentally believe we will get through this because people support us. People want to come to us for care. We are embedded in our states and a part of our community in deep ways. We matter too much for our states and our communities to just accept that we would close our doors.”

(Photo by Bretwood Higman, Erin McKittrick/Ground Truth Trekking via Creative Commons license)The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took a rare step under former President Joe Biden to block development of the Pebble mine — Alaska’s largest known copper and gold deposit, which for years has fueled controversy over its potential impacts on one of the world’s largest salmon runs.
Now, under President Donald Trump, the agency is giving its past Pebble decisions another look and negotiating a deal that could end a lawsuit filed by Pebble’s developer — an announcement that’s boosted the company’s stock price this week.
Administration officials “have been actively considering the agency decisions” and are “open to reconsideration,” according to a recent court filing submitted by U.S. Department of Justice lawyers. The three-page document does not elaborate, though it references the past decision by the EPA and a separate decision by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to deny Pebble a key permit.
The Trump administration is now negotiating a potential settlement to a lawsuit that challenged the decision — a case filed last year by Pebble Limited Partnership, the project’s developer — the document added.
Pebble’s chief executive, John Shively, said that a settlement could result in the withdrawal of the EPA’s preemptive veto of mining activity in the project area. The proposed mine would be built in the Bristol Bay region, in the headwaters of the world’s largest sockeye salmon run.
A reversal of the veto would amount to a stunning shift in momentum for the Pebble project, which seemed all but dead after the EPA decision two years ago. The project would still face major obstacles to its construction, including the 2020 denial of the key wetlands permit by the Army Corps.
Pebble appealed the wetlands permit decision, but the Army Corps last year rejected the appeal, citing the EPA’s 2023 veto.
Pebble sued both the EPA and the Army Corps.
A reversal of the EPA decision would give the developers “an opportunity to go back to the Corps,” said Shively. He declined to share additional details about a possible settlement.
The stock price of Northern Dynasty Minerals, Pebble’s publicly traded, Vancouver-based parent company, rose by more than 50% in the past week — a likely sign of investors’ enthusiasm about a possible settlement.
Pebble would be one of the world’s largest copper, gold and molybdenum mines. Boosters, including Alaska Republican Gov. Mike Dunleavy and two local Indigenous-owned corporations, say it could create much-needed jobs and generate billions of dollars in revenue for the state and rural Alaskans.
But the Bristol Bay region is also home to a prolific sockeye salmon run, which sustains rural subsistence fishermen and an annual commercial harvest worth more than $100 million. The proposed mine faces broad local, statewide and national opposition from fishermen, tribal governments, Bristol Bay’s regional Alaska Native-owned corporation and environmental groups.
“The legal, administrative, and public record, really, over and over and over again proves that this type of mining and mine does not belong in Bristol Bay,” said Alannah Hurley, executive director of the United Tribes of Bristol Bay, a regional tribal consortium that fiercely opposes Pebble.
“This is something we’ve been fighting for decades, and it’s just going to be devastating yet again to be put through the rigamarole of a potential settlement,” said Hurley, reached by phone this week from her fish camp on the shores of Nushagak Bay, downstream of the Pebble deposit.
Given its size and proximity to the Bristol Bay fishery, Pebble critics include figures typically supportive of resource development, like Alaska’s two Republican U.S. senators. Conservative pundit Tucker Carlson and even Donald Trump Jr., who is known to fish recreationally in the region, have also expressed concerns.
Trump’s first administration initially appeared more supportive of the project, undoing efforts by the Obama administration to block mine development. But in 2020, after an outpouring of public opposition — including from Republicans like Trump Jr. — the Army Corps denied Pebble’s application for a Clean Water Act permit.
In a court filing late last year, Pebble’s lawyers argued that the Army Corps’ decision “was likely due to political interference” by Trump Jr. and “his friends, and substantial political contributors to President Trump’s reelection.”
Soon after the start of Trump’s second term, Justice Department lawyers and Pebble agreed to pause the litigation while government officials caught up on the case. Some close observers of the project noted that Trump’s new chief of staff, Susie Wiles, once worked as a lobbyist for Pebble.
The EPA declined to answer questions from Northern Journal this week.
“At this time, our understanding is that there may be an updated submission made to EPA for consideration, but there is nothing currently before the agency to that effect,” Molly Vaseliou, the EPA’s associate administrator for public affairs, said in an emailed statement.

(Courtesy of Protect Tesuque)Residents in Tesuque Village and an area luxury resort are back in New Mexico courts, with both groups saying the other has gone too far in a clash over a sewage permit.
The dispute follows months of back and forth in court as well as administrative processes, which are poised to continue.
Last week, the conflict between the nonprofit Protect Tesuque and Bishop’s Lodge even landed at the New Mexico Supreme Court, where justices sided with Bishop’s Lodge, denied the emergency petition from residents and allowed the permitting process to proceed.
Now, Bishop’s Lodge wants a judge to bar Protect Tesuque members from weekly protests on the road outside the resort. The July 2 civil lawsuit follows a June 13 letter Bishop’s Lodge’s attorneys sent to the nonprofit expressing “concern over the safety of drivers, pedestrians, demonstrators and Bishop Lodge guests,” and warning of additional legal action if the protests continued.
The protests continued.
“Defendants block the State Road 590/Bishop’s Lodge Road — a public road — harass Lodge guests and staff, sound car horns and drums and endanger unsuspecting motorists,” court documents state. “…Defendants escalating protests create such a perilous situation, that the Lodge feels it has no alternative but to seek judicial relief.”
The heart of the dispute centers over the renewal of a wastewater permit for Bishop’s Lodge and nearby housing. The new permit would allow the release of about 30,000 gallons per day of treated wastewater from a new wastewater treatment plant into a new low-dose disposal field using a treatment plant installed in 2024. The current permit allows Bishop’s Lodge to discharge about 14,700 gallons per day into two disposal fields on the property.Dozens of residents in the village of about 1,000 have opposed multiple proposals for sewage disposal by the resort. Recently, they coalesced around claims that the proposed disposal plan would threaten private drinking water wells.
Bishop’s Lodge and the New Mexico Environment Department maintain the treated wastewater quality exceeds state and federal standards.
In its newest complaint, Bishop’s Lodge asks for enforcement of a nearly 1-mile buffer zone, to prevent further obstruction of the road; to bar the nonprofit ‘s members from trespassing, harassing guests and staff; and from further unauthorized recording.
“Flying a drone low over the Lodge to video (among other things) guests in the pool and restaurant and subsequently posting that video online with inflammatory dialogue adds to the harassing atmosphere,” the memo attached to the complaint stated.
Bishop’s Lodge also requests Protect Tesuque pay attorneys fees in the complaint.
“While defendants may assert their activities are protected speech, the First Amendment does not protect harassment,” the complaint states.
The complaint includes testimony from resort staff, and an investigator hired by Bishop’s Lodge, saying that residents protesting — including people on crutches or in a wheelchair — blocked the road and, at one point, crossed into the property. Attached videos and photos were not available in the exhibits list online, according to a review of court documents.
In a statement, Protect Tesuque called the lawsuit a “clear and troubling attempt to intimidate,” the nonprofit and its board, and broadly denied the allegations, saying the protests have been peaceful.
“The accusations in the complaint are not only false, they are defamatory,” the statement said. “Protesters have not blocked roads, trespassed on private property, harassed guests or employees, or engaged in any of the hyperbolic behaviors” described in the complaint, they said.
The group further contends it’s being sued “for standing up for clean water and public health. The individuals named in this complaint have done nothing more than participate in peaceful protests, attend public hearings, and speak out about dangerous disposal practices that threaten Tesuque’s drinking water.”

(Photo by InciWeb/U.S. Forest Service)The threat of wildfires across the Northwest will escalate through the summer, extended forecasts show, due to “extreme high temperatures.” In response, Gov. Tina Kotek is declaring a state of emergency across Oregon, meant to mobilize state and federal agencies and resources to prevent and respond to fires.
Kotek made the declaration on Wednesday in an executive order, following six emergency declarations for individual fires just in the last two weeks. Most of the nearly 60 active fires in the state are in southern Oregon.
The statewide emergency will remain in effect until the governor either determines that the threat has significantly receded, the fire season officially ends or until the end of the year.
“Oregon is already experiencing a devastating wildfire season that will have lasting consequences,” Kotek said in a news release. “The summer is only getting hotter, drier and more dangerous — we have to be prepared for worsening conditions.”
The declaration directs state agencies and the National Guard to collaborate on wildfire response and prevention by sharing personnel, equipment and resources. It also directs those agencies and Guard troops to meet requests coming from the state’s primary fire agencies — the Oregon Department of Forestry and the State Fire Marshal — and local and tribal governments.
It follows six Emergency Conflagration Act declarations for wildfires that have burned thousands of acres. Invoking the act similarly directs state agencies to help local fire departments with staff and with state financial resources.
Kotek in her news release also advised Oregonians to sign up for the statewide emergency alert system OR-Alert, to have an evacuation plan and to have an emergency “go kit” ready.
The state’s fire dashboard lists 58 active wildfires that have so far burned more than 54,500 acres. Many of the fires are mostly contained. Nearly half of the fires ignited due to natural causes, while the cause is still undetermined for most of the others. Ten fires so far have been determined to be human caused.
Most of the fires are in southern Oregon, and all but one of the fires was first discovered within the last two weeks. Nearly half occurred or are burning in Jackson County, six in Josephine County, five in Jefferson County and four in Klamath County.
The Department of Environmental Quality on Wednesday advised residents in Klamath and
Jefferson counties to stay indoors and avoid being outside doing vigorous physical activity due to smoke from the Hagelstein and Elk fires.
No fatalities have been recorded this fire season, but six people have been injured. At least five structures have been recorded damaged or destroyed and only in the Elk Fire.
More than 2,200 Oregonians at nearly 900 addresses are currently in an evacuation zone, according to the state fire dashboard. More than half are at the Level 1 “Be Ready” stage. More than 800 are in the Level 2 “Be Set” stage, meaning they should be ready to evacuate at a moment’s notice. More than 200 are at the Level 3 “Go Now” stage, meaning they are in extreme danger and should be evacuating or already evacuated.
Kotek in her news release also encouraged Oregonians who believe they’ve been charged excessive prices or fees for essential goods and services during a wildfire emergency to report those claims to the Oregon Department of Justice Consumer Protection Services here.

(Photo by Jacquelyn Jimenez Romero/Washington State Standard)Washington’s Hope Card program has given out 2,000 wallet-sized, portable copies of protection orders, according to the program’s organizers.
Launched Jan. 1, the program offers vulnerable adults and survivors of domestic violence, sexual assault, stalking and harassment who have civil protection orders against their abusers an easier alternative to carrying bulky court documents with them at all times. 
The program is intended to make it easier for law enforcement to deal with protection order violations and protect survivors. 
“It’s really translating to a breaking of chains for people,” said Lauren Pilnick, Hope Card senior court program analyst for the Washington Administrative Office of the Courts. “Being able to have one less thing regarding their victimization on their mind every time they leave the house is hard to quantify, but it’s huge for people.” 
The cards are free and available to anyone with certain types of full civil protection orders. 
Legislation passed earlier this year fortified the program by making Hope Cards available to extreme risk protection order holders,  prohibiting applicant fees for the cards, and securing funding to translate program materials into 13 more languages. 
The law also reduced the amount of information about the restrained person that the Administrative Office of the Court needs to have in order to issue a Hope Card. The reduction was meant to better accommodate court capabilities and make data entry easier. 
The law goes into effect July 27. 
Each card contains the restrained person’s name and description along with the protected individual’s name, birth date, and some basic information about their case.
Hope Card holders can show the cards to law enforcement, employers, school officials and landlords if an abuser is violating an order.
A person can request a card any time while their order is active. They are valid until a protection order expires, is dismissed or materially modified.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Hunger fighting advocates gathered Wednesday at the World Food Prize Hall of Laureates in Des Moines for the Iowa Hunger Summit, with a focus on the root causes and local solutions to hunger that can make big differences. 
Speakers focused not only on the ongoing challenges of providing food, which the World Food Prize Foundation calls a moral right, but also on the rippling effects the federal “big beautiful” law will have on food programming. 
“I would be seriously remiss if I did not acknowledge that government policy changes are significantly impacting our collective work right now,” said Ann McGlynn, recipient of the 2025 Iowa SHARES Humanitarian Award. 
McGlynn was awarded for her work as founder and executive director of Tapestry Farms in Davenport. Her nonprofit reclaims underutilized land and uses it to grow fresh and culturally relevant produce to strengthen food systems for communities in need. 
It also provides social services to refugees from countries such as Afghanistan, Syria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
She highlighted recent “slashing” to government-funded food assistance programs and the “indefinite pause” to the resettlement program inspired by former Iowa Gov. Robert D. Ray, whose work inspired the SHARES award.
Beyond policy changes, McGlynn encouraged participants to “be a friend to an immigrant or refugee,” plant a garden, give produce to people in need, lend time to food assistance programs and call elected officials.
“If you would like some help, you can reach out to me and I’ll be personally happy to help,” McGlynn added.
Local efforts helping address high levels of food insecurity
According to Feeding America’s latest Map the Meal Gap report, 1 in 8 Iowans, and 1 in 6 Iowa children are food insecure. A Food Bank of Iowa analysis of the data found that each of Iowa’s 99 counties saw an increase in food insecurity rates in the past year.

World Food Prize Foundation President Mashal Husain said while the meal gap can be “measured in millions,” the “shame, the isolation, the slow erosion of hope” that hunger brings cannot be measured. 
“Yet we are not helpless,” Husain said. “In fact, there is so much we can do, because in Iowa, we don’t just talk about problems, we roll up our sleeves, we care, we show up and we choose to act … we make change, and that is what from the ground up, is all about.” 
Speakers and sessions at the summit focused on local solutions, the need for federal, local and community support and also on dreaming up new solutions. 
In a session about maternal hunger support, Lindsy Carroll, an Iowa-based nutrition educator for the Women, Infant and Children, or WIC, program,  said her dream was for paid maternal and paternal leave in the country. 
Her call was met with applause in the packed presentation room. 
A breastfeeding coordinator for WIC, Yolanda Pina, said she dreamed of support for community gardens in WIC communities. 
The speakers also highlighted locally led solutions, like Hy-Vee’s integration in its online shopping app that allows WIC users to shop online with their WIC cards. 
Alison Hard, the public policy director for the National WIC Association, said Iowa was one of the first states to launch this service that makes shopping with WIC less time consuming. 
Hard said this was the type of local solution that can drive national change. 
Federal changes impacting hunger work
WIC is a discretionary budget program, meaning it wasn’t affected by cuts in the “big beautiful” law that made changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, and Medicaid. 
Even so, Hard called for congressional support to fully fund the WIC program in their budget bills this year in order to “avoid waitlists” and ensure every “eligible family is able to benefit from WIC’s critical services.” 
“Participation in WIC is rising because of inflation, rising grocery costs and the expiration of other federal supports, and we anticipate that will be even more so after the passage of reconciliation,” Hard said. 
Hard also mentioned a proposed cut to WIC’s Cash Value Benefit, which allows participants to purchase more fresh fruits and vegetables with their benefits. In 2021, the CVB amount increased from $9 a month for children, to more than $20 a month, and higher amounts depending on circumstances. 
The House budget for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the WIC program, notes a 10% reduction in funding for vouchers. 
Hard said these vouchers also need to be protected. 
Tom Vilsack, CEO of World Food Prize, led a session about the impacts of hunger and food funding cuts to schools, but started by emphasizing the importance of the WIC program and urging attendees to promote the program so “those who qualify and could use WIC, know about the program.” 
Vilsack was joined by a number of education policy leaders, including Patricia Montague, who leads the School Nutrition Association. 
Montague said she fears the impacts federal action will have on school lunch programs. She said school feeding programs are already underfunded, meaning extra costs to cover the program typically come from the state’s general budget. 
Montague said with the changes to SNAP in the federal reconciliation bill that mean the states have to pick up a bigger share of the program, she’s concerned states will no longer be able to supplement school lunch budgets. 
These school lunch programs, other panelists said, are essential to students. 
Aaron Dworkin, CEO of the National Summer Learning Association, said schools give kids laptops, books, pencils, and all the tools they need to learn. 
“Why would we not just give them meals?” Dworkin said. 
Vilsack ended the segment by quoting World Food Prize laureate Cary Fowler, who said, “If you don’t feed people, you fee conflict.” 
Iowa’s alternative summer feeding program is ‘a start’
While he was U.S. secretary of Agriculture, Vilsack helped to champion the SUN BUCKS program, to help low income families receive a little bit of extra funding during the summer months, when schools aren’t providing two meals, five days a week to students. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds has opted out of participating in the feeding program every year. This year, she spearheaded the Healthy Kids Iowa program as a cheaper alternative.
Vilsack said that during Covid, food box programs fell short in catering to dietary needs, but added “that’s part of the challenge.”
“The SUN BUCKS program is a program that’s pretty easy to administer and provides assistance and help to families. The food-box program is a little different but it’s a start and we’ll see how it goes,” Vilsack said.
He also announced the relaunching of the Iowa Hunger Directory, an initiative to profile all organizations fighting hunger to provide insight into how Iowans can support their work around the state. 
“I think basically, if you don’t feed kids, you’re not feeding your future,” Vilsack said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/img_9723_720.jpg,,,2025-07-16 19:11:16.249842

(Alixel Cabrera/Utah News Dispatch) Six months after Salt Lake City Mayor Erin Mendenhall presented a public safety plan in response to demands from state leaders, she gave an update on the plan’s progress on Wednesday, saying crime has gone down and the city has implemented community-based approaches to improve safety.
But tensions between Utah’s capital and the state government remain, as Mendenhall says that the city’s requests for resources failed during the 2025 legislative session. 
During the past six months, the city switched police chiefs and achieved 12 of the 27 proposed actions, Mendenhall said. June also ended up recording the lowest overall crime rates in eight years. 
But, some of the plan’s recommendations for external partners have stalled. That includes allocating funding for services and housing, as well as considering policy changes to help tackle substance abuse and implementing a joint plan across state, county and city entities to improve public safety.

“I’m disappointed, and I wish that more progress was made on those external recommendations. During this year’s legislative session the city advocated for several clear policy changes that would have better advanced this plan, but many of them failed to pass through the legislature,” Mendenhall said. “I urge lawmakers to give those measures more serious consideration moving forward.”
Mendenhall’s public safety plan came after Gov. Spencer Cox and Republican legislative leaders gave Mendenhall a firm deadline to draft a plan to “restore public confidence, security and safety,” warning the Legislature could step in if progress stalled.
This year Salt Lake City officials advocated for 42 bills that aligned with the plan’s goal. Of those, 28 of them passed, “representing significant progress,” according to the plan update. 
Those that failed included the city’s request to dedicate an ongoing funding source for homeless services, increased funding for mental health treatment teams, and a requirement for more counties to provide residential behavioral health and substance abuse treatment.  
When Mendenhall released her plan, she offered city-owned land for a temporary shelter campus if the state or philanthropic groups funded its operations. But now, the state has considered that site for a permanent facility, Mendenhall said.
‘Fed up’: SLC mayor answers Utah leaders’ call for plan to ‘restore public safety’

“Progress has now stalled,” she said. “The city has done everything in our power to support this effort. Now we need the state to act to fully fund development and ongoing operations for this state-owned campus.”
The city added 400 additional homeless shelter beds this year, extended its winter shelter into the summer months, and the Salt Lake City Council approved more youth beds. While Mendenhall acknowledged that systemic changes take a lot of time and work, she reiterated the city can’t keep doing this alone.
“This crisis demands sustainable, long-term funding from the state to meet the scale of this challenge in the fastest growing state in this nation,” she said.
The plan’s first six months
One of the first actions city officials took as part of the public safety plan was to deploy the Violent Crime Apprehension Team, or VCAT, which targets gang activity to disrupt drug and firearm trafficking, Mendenhall said. 
Over the past six months the team helped seize thousands of fentanyl pills, over 20 pounds of narcotics and nearly 100 illegally-possessed firearms. 
With a new Community Impact Division within the Salt Lake City Police Department, officers have also been assigned to patrol areas downtown, along the Jordan River Trail and in the Ballpark neighborhood. That team also works to connect unsheltered people with services, the mayor said.
“They’ve taken hundreds of criminals off the streets. They’ve tracked suspects, and they dismantled drug operations. At Cottonwood Park alone, (Community Impact Division) officers assigned to our bike units seized over 5,000 fentanyl pills and more than $11,000 in cash from a single dealer,” Mendenhall said.
Salt Lake City dedicated $4 million of this year’s budget for the new public safety initiatives, including added security across nine city parks and sections of the Jordan River Trail. City officials have also improved street lighting in high-traffic areas.

Officer proactivity is up nearly 10% every year, and the city is on track to end 2025 with over 1,000 more jail bookings than in 2024, Mendenhall said.
But the public safety plan is not just about the police since they aren’t equipped to solve every problem, Mendenhall said. She said a more holistic solution needs to come from a more community-based approach, with teams that work to keep the city clean and restore neglected spaces, and partnerships with businesses and residents in the downtown area to craft safety solutions.
The city is also eyeing a pilot program to bring free restrooms, showers and laundry facilities for those living on the streets, the mayor said. 
To Salt Lake City Police Chief Brian Redd, the public safety plan has two themes; accountability for those who choose to victimize the community, and support for those in need, better aligning the criminal justice and social services systems. The city also created a system to connect the biggest repeat offenders in the criminal justice system in the city to housing, treatment and services. 
Additionally, Redd said, the public safety approach includes investment in public safety technology, such as cameras and drones. 
“Of course, as we utilize this type of technology, we’re going to be guided by principles of protecting privacy and civil liberties community involvement in those decisions,” Redd said.

Speaking to an estimated 1,500 people at the city’s convention center, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt unveiled artist renderings of the slightly under $1 billion project, which is expected to be completed in time for the NBA team’s 2028-29 season. 
The arena will be at least 750,000 square feet, Holt said. Although seating has yet to be determined, it will be similar to the Paycom Center with a smaller capacity. The structure will be a 360-degree arena with glass window walls. The design of the arena aims to bring people together with closer seating, Holt said. 
“It is a statement piece for our city, and I really think it will be one of the most beautiful arenas of its kind, not just in the United States, but in the world,” Holt said.

In his State of the City address, Holt said the square footage of the current arena is too small and lacks the amenities of a modern arena. He believes that the new arena will address those issues. 
Oklahoma City voters in 2019 approved a sales tax to fund the Metropolitan Area Projects 4, also called MAPS. In 2023, voters approved using it for the new arena. The penny sales tax will start when the MAPS 4 tax ends in 2028. The Oklahoma City Thunder ownership group is contributing $50 million to the project. MAPS 4 funding will contribute $78 million. 
David Manica, the architect, said he did not know when construction would begin. The new arena will be built on the site where the Myriad Convention Center currently stands. Demolition is currently underway on that structure to make room for the new arena. 
“I think we’ve started something that’s really special for this place and for this city and for these people,” Manica said. “There’s more to come.”

The document asks the high court to suspend Jackson County Circuit Judge Jerri Zhang’s preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of almost all of the state’s laws regulating abortion services. If the court does not grant the stay immediately, the filing states, the high court should hold an expedited hearing on Aug. 11.
In response, attorneys for the ACLU of Missouri and Planned Parenthood asked for arguments the week of Aug. 18.
The battle over abortion rights has been a state question since 2022, when the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the landmark 1973 Roe v Wade decision. The decision triggered a law that banned all abortions in the state except in cases of medical emergency that endangered a woman’s life.
Abortion became legal again in Missouri under the provisions 52% of voters approved as state constitutional Amendment 3 in November. But because the amendment did not directly repeal state laws banning or regulating abortion, Comprehensive Health of Planned Parenthood Great Plains, based in Kansas City, and Planned Parenthood Great Rivers, based in St. Louis, sued to block enforcement of those laws.
The state does not dispute that women have a right to obtain an abortion prior to when a fetus is viable, according to the filing signed by state solicitor general Josh Devine and five other attorneys.
But the laws and regulations blocked by Zhang deal with licensing and regulation of procedures that were in place before the 2022 decision overturning Roe v Wade, the attorneys wrote, and should be allowed to remain in force.
“Planned Parenthood wrongly claimed that it could not provide abortion in Missouri unless all the state’s health-and-safety laws were enjoined,” the attorneys wrote. “But from the beginning of this litigation, the state has expressly agreed that Planned Parenthood can perform elective pre-viability abortions under Amendment 3. The state’s lone interest is ensuring that Missouri abortions are safe for the woman…”
In a response, attorneys for the ACLU of Missouri, which is representing the state’s two Planned Parenthood affiliates, wrote that granting a stay of Zhang’s ruling would deny Missourians the rights enshrined in the Constitution in November.
“The trial court made clear factual findings supporting its determinations and committed no error of law,” the response signed by ACLU attorney Gillian Wilcox and 13 other lawyers. “And (the state of Missouri) suffer no irreparable harm from being prevented from enforcing laws that are now presumptively unconstitutional.”
Surgical abortions resumed from February to May following two earlier rulings by Zhang, but ended when the Missouri Supreme Court struck down her orders on technical legal grounds. Surgical abortions resumed at the Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas City and St. Louis Zhang issued her July 3 decision and appointments are being scheduled for a resumption of abortion services in Columbia next week.
In her July 3 order, Zhang found that the total ban on abortions that took effect in 2022 clearly conflicted with the rights secured by the abortion amendment, which received 52% of the vote in November.
She also blocked enforcement of a law requiring two appointments, 72 hours apart, to obtain abortion services and that women be required to take state-produced material on fetal development.
The order blocks enforcement of laws requiring special abortion facility licensing and that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.
Zhang’s order keeps in place rules that only doctors can provide abortion services and that the woman seeking an abortion have an in-person appointment. The appointment can, however, be by telemedicine, Zhang ruled as she blocked a separate rule.
Medication abortions are not being offered because Zhang blocked enforcement of regulations describing what should be in a complication plan for medication abortion patients. The rules stated what the plans should include, such as instructions for women if bleeding occurs and designating a hospital ready to provide care in emergencies. Zhang’s decision left the law requiring the complication plans in place, but without regulations defining the plans, they cannot be submitted or approved.
The complication plans are an essential safeguard when problems occur, the team from the attorney general’s office. While medication abortions are the most common way pregnancies are terminated, the safeguards of current law must be in place to allow them, the attorneys wrote.
“Amendment 3 establishes a generic right to abortion, not a right to a specific procedure, and there was no right to a specific procedure under Roe either,” the attorneys wrote. 
In the filing to the Supreme Court, the team from the attorney general’s office challenged both the venue — the location of the case — of the Planned Parenthood affiliates as well as the legal basis for the challenge to state laws and regulations.
The case should be in Cole County, not Jackson County, the attorneys argue. The lead defendant is the Jackson County Prosecuting Attorney, Melesa Johnson, but the state defendants are all headquartered in Jefferson City.
The attorneys for the state also argue that some of the blocked laws and regulations also apply to non-abortion medical procedures. There is one law for example, requiring abortion providers to be licensed as ambulatory surgical centers with admitting privileges at a nearby hospital.
If the ruling stands, the attorneys wrote, “the state could no longer require physicians providing orthopedic surgeries in ambulatory surgical centers to have clinical privileges in hospitals…even though that has nothing to do with abortion.”
The licensing regulations are general and Planned Parenthood should be governed by them, the attorneys wrote.
In their response, the ACLU and Planned Parenthood attorneys argued that the state is trying to divert the court from the underlying issues.
“Respondents are subject to medical licensing requirements and professional ethical standards applicable to all health care,” the attorneys wrote. “They challenge only discriminatory abortion specific requirements that serve no legitimate medical purpose and make constitutional rights inaccessible. Respondents sue precisely to vindicate their patients’ rights to receive essential healthcare in Missouri.”
Issuing a stay of Zhang’s order would deny Missourians their rights, the attorneys wrote.
“Patients have already scheduled abortions at Respondents’ health centers for the coming weeks,” they wrote. “A stay from this court would mean that these appointments would have to be canceled and these patients could not obtain an abortion in Missouri, despite their constitutional right to do so.”
While Planned Parenthood and the state battle in court over the regulatory framework for providing legal abortions, a separate court battle is also underway in Cole County over the language for a proposal placed on the ballot by state lawmakers to repeal the abortion rights amendment.
A hearing is scheduled for Thursday to set a trial date for the Cole County case.

The Republican from North Carolina is likely to be the deciding factor as to whether Emil Bove, a former lawyer for Trump and high-ranking Justice Department official, makes it through the Senate Judiciary Committee in his bid to receive a lifetime appointment to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.
  Emil Bove testifies before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on June 25. (Photo: Senate.gov video feed)
Tillis told reporters on July 9 that he is likely to “go with the staff recommendation” and vote in favor of Bove’s nomination, according to Politico, which under a party-line vote would mean Bove’s nomination proceeds to the full Senate for a vote. Because Republicans only hold a 12-10 majority on the Judiciary Committee, any defection is enough to sink a nominee.
Earlier this year, Tillis used this leverage to sink the nomination of Ed Martin as U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, citing his legal defense of January 6 rioters as the key obstacle to his support. “We have to be very, very clear that what happened on January 6 was wrong,” Tillis told the Associated Press.
Bove is nominated to a seat on the Third Circuit that opened in June 2023, which former President Joe Biden unsuccessfully attempted to fill with Adeel Mangi, a Muslim-American lawyer whose confirmation was stalled over what Mangi called “performative McCarthyism” surrounding his ties to Muslim organizations in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel. His nomination was dropped as part of a deal between Senate Democrats and Republicans last year to advance a slate of stalled district court judges.
Bove has come under fire for his actions as Trump’s lieutenant at the Justice Department, including carrying out a purge of prosecutors involved in cases against Jan. 6 rioters from the D.C. U.S. Attorney’s Office. He also garnered controversy for dropping corruption charges against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, a decision that led to resignations from the department and which required Bove to appear in court to assure a judge there was “no quid pro quo” in exchange for the dismissal.
“It’s a striking contrast because Adeel Mangi was extremely well-qualified, and basically the Republicans crucified him, and I don’t use that term lightly,” said Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond. “It’s deeply ironic to put somebody like that forward, somebody like Bove, for that seat after they robbed the Democrats of that position.”
In the wake of Tillis’s announcement that he would not seek reelection to his Senate seat next year, some observers noted that he may have greater latitude to defy Trump on key issues — likely giving him greater freedom to break with his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee on divisive judicial nominees.
“He could still change his mind, he may keep an open mind during the discussion, and I imagine the Democrats will say scathing things about Bove,” Tobias said. “My prediction, for what it’s worth, is that it’s likely to be a party-line vote, 12-10.”
A Justice Department whistleblower, Erez Reuveni, has also come forward alleging that Bove directed his subordinates to defy court orders and engage in illegal conduct in the course of Trump’s mass deportation efforts. Bove and other Trump administration officials denied these allegations. Though the whistleblower offered to testify before the Judiciary Committee, Committee Chair Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) declined to extend him an invitation or hold a second hearing on the nomination.
On Tuesday, more than 80 former federal and state judges, including two former Third Circuit judges, sent a letter to the Judiciary Committee warning that Bove’s confirmation would “compromise the integrity of the courts” and “set a dangerous precedent that judicial power may be wielded in service of personal fealty rather than constitutional duty.”
“Mr. Bove’s egregious record of mistreating law enforcement officers, abusing power, and disregarding the law itself disqualifies him for this position,” the judges wrote. “Proceeding with this nomination, particularly in the face of credible and sworn allegations from a nonpartisan DOJ attorney that Mr. Bove violated court orders and instructed public servants to act unlawfully, would be a disservice to the constitution, to law enforcement, and to the rule of law.”
Similarly, more than 900 former Department of Justice officials wrote to the committee Wednesday expressing “grave concern over the senseless attacks on the dedicated career employees who are the backbone of the Department,” a charge they said has been led by Bove.
“It is intolerable to us that anyone who disgraces the Justice Department would be promoted to one of the highest courts in the land, as it should be intolerable to anyone committed to maintaining our ordered system of justice,” the officials wrote.
The Judiciary Committee is expected to vote on whether to advance Bove’s nomination at its meeting Thursday beginning at 9:15 a.m.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/SenThomTillis_7-2023-1024x636.jpg,,,2025-07-16 19:11:16.249842

Article Summary

Susana Mendoza will not run for reelection as Illinois comptroller, the state’s chief financial officer. She is rumored to be considering a run for Chicago mayor.
Mendoza held the comptroller’s office during the worst budgetary crisis in state history and through the COVID-19 pandemic.
A key step in how Cook County Democrats choose who to endorse for statewide office is happening this week.
Candidates are expected to announce whether they will run to replace Mendoza in the coming weeks.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


CHICAGO — After almost a decade, Illinois State Comptroller Susana Mendoza will not seek another term as the state’s chief financial officer.

Mendoza, who took office in December 2016 after beating an ally of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner in a special election, has overseen the state’s financial systems through both the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst budget crisis any state has faced in modern history.

At a news conference Wednesday, Mendoza said she’s not running for reelection in the 2026 comptroller’s race, so she will have time to decide her next career move.

“I'm going to figure out what the right move is for our family, for our city, our state, find out where I'm needed most, that next biggest challenge that I need to take on,” Mendoza said.

Prior to taking statewide office, Mendoza was the first woman to be the Chicago City Clerk. Mendoza previously spent a decade in the Illinois House of Representatives.

It’s been widely speculated that Mendoza, who ran for Chicago mayor in 2019, is eyeing a run to unseat sitting Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson in 2027.

While she didn’t commit to a run, she said she is “leaving the door open.” Several U.S. House seats are up for grabs, along with Illinois’ first open U.S. Senate seat since 2010.

But when asked whether she was interested in a position in Congress, Mendoza laughed.

“No thank you,” she quickly said Thursday, before moving on to questions about a potential mayoral bid.

Comptroller vacancy 

The comptroller’s office, traditionally a low-visibility role, became a high-stakes proxy battle between Democratic and Republican power brokers during the budget impasse of the mid-2010s.

Mendoza became the most vocal and high-profile statewide Democratic foil to Republicans at the height of the more than two-year budget impasse between Rauner and Democrats in the General Assembly. After Comptroller Judy Baar Topinka died in 2014, Rauner appointed Leslie Munger to the position. Mendoza beat Munger with 49.5% of the vote in a special election in 2016.

Mendoza gained statewide visibility for her frequent videos assailing Rauner and highlighting that the state was accruing a massive “bill backlog” driven by ongoing court-mandated expenditures amid dwindling revenue brought on by the impasse.

She won reelection in 2018 and 2022, routinely posting the widest margins of any statewide elected official.

No Republican, meanwhile, has won statewide office since Rauner  in 2014, and few have come especially close. This puts the focus for replacing Mendoza on the Democratic primary process. The announcement creates an opportunity for a new Democrat to make a run for an open statewide office for the first time since 2018.

Mendoza said she wanted to make the announcement early enough for people interested in replacing her to “make their pitches” to party officials. The Cook County Democratic Party — a powerhouse in statewide party politics — is holding its “slating” meetings this week to decide which candidates the party will endorse.

Rep. Margaret Croke, D-Chicago, is expected to appear at the slating for statewide candidates and make a formal announcement about her 2026 plans next week, according to sources close to the representative.

“With chaos unfolding at the national level, Illinoisans need steady state leadership and deserve a Comptroller who is prepared to lead with transparency, efficiency, and integrity,” Croke said in a statement after Mendoza’s announcement.

Lake County Treasurer Holly Kim is also expected to appear at the Cook County slating meeting, with an announcement about her plans in the coming weeks.

“Susana Mendoza raised the bar for transparency and accountability, and I intend to build on that legacy,” Kim said.

Sen. Javier Cervantes, D-Chicago, is also scheduled to appear at the slating meeting to discuss a potential comptroller bid.

Mendoza said she hopes her replacement is committed to serving the entire state, noting that while she is a Chicagoan, she said she has a “very soft spot in my heart for southern Illinois.”

Mayoral ambitions

While Mendoza did not commit to a run for mayor, she did speak at length about the needs of the city.

“Chicago is in dire need of competency, someone who understands the needs of the city, who understands how important the role of the city is to the good functioning of the whole state,” Mendoza said. “And I think we’ve had two very unsuccessful mayors in a row.”

Mendoza stressed public safety and Chicago’s need for a growth-centered economic policy.

“It’s not just our feathered friends that have flown south, it’s the most important bird in Chicago: the crane,” Mendoza said. “You can look at a city and gauge its financial health by the number of cranes that are in the sky. And, right now, you have an unobstructed, picture-perfect view of this city.”

If she runs, Mendoza could be joined by several other prominent Illinois politicians in the race for mayor. Illinois Secretary of State Alexi Giannoulias is also rumored to be considering a run.

Mendoza made her announcement at Los Comales, a restaurant in Chicago’s Little Village neighborhood that specializes in Mexico City-style tacos. Christina Gonzalez, the co-owner of the Los Comales chain and daughter of its founder, noted that Mendoza was from the neighborhood.

“She was always a customer here,” Gonzalez said. “Her parents brought her here and she knew my dad — my dad loved her.”

It’s the same restaurant where she announced her first run for state representative more than 20 years ago and her ill-fated mayoral bid in 2019.

Gonzalez said the restaurant, which was mostly empty aside from Mendoza’s supporters and reporters, has faced a significant slowdown in business recently, thanks to rumors about immigration enforcement.

A new report found travel time and costs for abortion care jumped for residents of states that ban abortions. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Travel costs for abortions and delays in care have increased in the wake of state abortion bans, according to a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health.
Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco surveyed more than 800 people across 14 states that implemented bans on abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision that dismantled the constitutional right to abortion.
“Our research shows that the Dobbs decision has increased the cost of abortion and slowed people down, but it hasn’t decreased their determination to get that care,” said Diana Greene Foster, a professor at UCSF and the lead author of the study.
The states covered by the study banned abortion during the research time frame, from June 2022 through June 2024: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
For people from those states, travel time, overnight stays and travel costs associated with seeking an abortion increased after bans were in place, Greene and her colleagues at UCSF’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program found.
GOP lawmakers push to charge women with homicide for seeking abortions

Travel time for residents from abortion-ban states increased from 2.8 hours to 11.3 hours, compared with abortion access before a ban, and travel costs increased from $179 to $372. More than half of respondents said their abortion care required an overnight hotel stay, compared with 5% before an abortion ban.
About 8 in 10 people who contacted an abortion clinic or call center reported traveling to another state for an abortion, the UCSF researchers found. Just 3% reported continuing their pregnancy to birth.
Last year, 155,000 people traveled out of state for abortion care, according to a June report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
Currently, 12 states have a total ban on abortion, while four more ban abortion after six weeks’ gestation, before many women know they are pregnant, according to the most recent Guttmacher data.
Republican lawmakers in some states have tried to clamp down on abortion travel in recent years. Idaho and Tennessee have both passed laws that make it a crime to help a pregnant minor travel to get a legal abortion without parental consent, while several other states have considered similar legislation. Most of Idaho’s law has been blocked by a judge, as has Tennessee’s.

(Photo by FS Productions/Getty Images)A University of Iowa researcher with experience studying rural health care says cuts to Medicaid will only complicate care for those who already face less access and place a new roadblock in the way of those trying to coordinate care throughout the state.
Tom Gruca, a professor of marketing at the UI, has experience studying Iowa’s health care system, specifically hospitals and clinics in the state’s rural areas. Using what he’s learned from researching rural maternity ward closures and how they have affected care, Gruca said changes to Medicaid signed into law by President Donald Trump will only make Iowa health care more complicated.
“When you complicate things, when you put barriers to coordination in, things get worse,” Gruca said. “And it’s interesting, because, if you think about the trend in health care throughout our state, we’re doing more and more to try to coordinate care, not make it less coordinated. And this, I think, is going to make it less coordinated.”

Gruca focused his research on the effect on mothers receiving prenatal care after a rural labor and delivery unit closed, even if prenatal care was still generally available through other means. His study, published in March 2023, found that among the seven rural counties that lost their labor and delivery units in 2018, fewer patients received adequate prenatal care, even when other prenatal options were available through family practices.
Those living in these areas were 24% more likely to have inadequate prenatal care than their neighbors, and Gruca said outcomes for people utilizing Medicaid were affected even more than those with other insurance, with the likelihood of not receiving adequate care jumping to 38%.

“It was bad for the ones who lost it, and it was even worse for those who were on Medicaid,” Gruca said.
According to data from the state on Medicaid enrollments, there were more than 703,000 Iowans enrolled in a Medicaid plan between January and March of this year. More than 45% of recipients were younger than 18 years old, and the 22-64 age range made up another 40% of the group.
The tax and spending bill signed by Trump on July 4 included cuts to Medicaid amounting to more than $1 trillion, which health policy nonprofit KFF reported would mainly come from implementing new work and reporting requirements for certain Medicaid recipients, repealing Biden administration rules simplifying the Medicaid application and renewal processes, limiting state directed payments and more. Nearly 12 million people across the U.S. would lose their insurance.
Cuts, which will take place over a decade, represent a projected decrease of $11 billion in federal spending in Iowa, according to KFF. Gruca said these changes could adversely affect Iowans’ coverage and compensation health care providers receive for accepting Medicaid patients, ultimately reducing access for those who already face barriers to receiving health care.
Nearly $4.5 billion of the projected cuts for Iowa will come from its rural areas, KFF reported, one portion of $155 billion in total to be stripped from rural areas across the country.
Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds said during an interview for a radio program Iowa will be able to weather these cuts more easily than other states with legislation passed this year aimed at creating a “hub-and-spoke” model for regional rural health care and increasing medical residency slots, though it would rely on federal funding to do so.
The state government also requested a federal waiver for, and passed legislation codifying, similar Medicaid work requirements as the federal bill, forcing those enrolled in the Iowa Health and Wellness Plan to complete at least 80 hours of work monthly.
Iowa GOP chair Jeff Kaufmann told journalists at a Trump visit to the Iowa State Fairgrounds July 3 that Republicans should stand by the bill and the Medicaid cuts embedded within it, despite opposition.
“Listen to this very carefully, folks: Do not cede an inch when you’re talking to your neighbors and friends,” Kaufmann said. “And it says this – if you work and if you’re legal, you’re not going to get kicked off Medicaid, that’s a lie. It’s a lie for desperate people.”
While GOP advocates have denied the level of risk to Americans touted by opponents to the legislation, Gruca said people need to look at long-term consequences rather than immediate impacts and think about how less coordination of care could lead to increased expenditures as well as worse health outcomes.
Whenever care for a patient becomes more complicated, Gruca said, whether through the closure of a labor and delivery unit forcing a mother to find a different doctor for prenatal care or making Medicaid harder to enroll in, keep and find providers who take it, patients and their health outcomes feel the hit.
“It isn’t going to make things better, because when things are less coordinated, they don’t run better,” Gruca said. “That’s really the most common sense thing there is, but, you know, those are choices people make.”
There are efforts in Iowa to better coordinate care for hospitals and patients, Gruca said, including work from the UI providing resources and training to hospitals still offering prenatal care throughout the state. However, with the Medicaid changes possibly forcing more providers to stop taking the insurance, Medicaid patients could have an even harder time finding care they qualify for in the future.
“If we’re serious, and we keep saying we’re serious about keeping rural communities vital, we have to make sure that we’re providing services in the rural communities where people live,” Gruca said. “Can’t just say, ‘Well, it’s great that you live there, thanks for that, but get in a car to drive 45 minutes for your appointment.’ It just doesn’t really work, and we already see that before the most recent changes. I don’t think the most recent changes will make this situation better.”

Next to Torrez is Bill Rodriguez, who directs the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program at Santa Fe Public Schools. (Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez and attorneys general from 22 states and the District of Columbia on Monday afternoon filed a lawsuit in federal court in Rhode Island asking a judge to order the Trump administration to lift a freeze on $7 billion meant for K-12 and adult education.
The money comes to the states through seven different federal grant programs meant for student learning and achievement; after-school programs; teacher training; and adult education and literacy.
At a news conference with public school officials in Santa Fe on Wednesday afternoon, Torrez said the funding freeze undermines not only education, but also public safety in the long run.
“What happens to the kids who no longer have high-quality educational support in the summer?” Torrez asked. “All of that impacts their ability to succeed in the education system and makes them far more likely to end up in the criminal justice system.”
Bill Rodriguez, who directs the 21st Century Community Learning Centers program at Santa Fe Public Schools, said approximately 60 after-school staff in the state’s capital serve 700 families and their students in 13 elementary and K-8 schools. Those workers are asking if they should start looking for new jobs, he said.
“Without the program, students’ academic growth could be impacted, and parents may be faced with making the difficult decision to leave their children at home alone, or being watched by older siblings after school,” Rodriguez said.
According to the lawsuit, the U.S. Education Department has approved New Mexico’s grant funding plan since 2015, most recently on April 25, and state officials and school districts expected to receive more than $44 million on July 1.
Schools weren’t notified of the freeze until the day before that deadline on June 30, giving them almost no time to mitigate its impacts on families, school employees and children, said Peter McWain, executive director of curriculum and instruction at Santa Fe Public Schools.
“Without 21st Century funding, districts like Santa Fe Public Schools cannot give reasonable assurance of 21st Century after-school programming for this coming school year,” McWain said. “21st Century programming supports children who, without this funding, have nowhere else to go.”
Kristie Medina, superintendent for Raton Public Schools in rural northeastern New Mexico, said the freeze will have a direct and devastating impact on students in her district and across the state.
“In New Mexico, where many students live in rural, low-income, multi-lingual communities, these funds are not extra, they’re very essential to each and every community,” Medina said.

Torrez said he finds it ironic that Trump issued an executive order seeking to make English the official language of the United States, and yet cut support for students who want to learn English.
“They want to more fully participate in the American Dream and in American society, and making these kinds of cuts will have a dramatic impact on their ability to do that,” he said.
The lawsuit notes that the New Mexico Constitution requires the state government to provide funding so that teachers can be trained to be proficient in both English and Spanish, and have the ability to teach English.
It also points out that state law makes it a goal for New Mexico’s public schools to make all students, including English language learners, bilingual and biliterate in English and a second language, either Spanish or a Native American language.
All three of New Mexico’s representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives last week asked the Trump administration to lift the freeze, including Rep. Gabe Vasquez, who himself was an English language learner.
Trump administration withholding $44M in education funding from New Mexico

Ian Gates, with the New Mexico Out-of-School Time Network, urged the state Public Education Department to find funding to continue to support 21st Century Community Learning Centers.
Gates said New Mexico allocated $15 million to after-school programs in its annual budget during the most recent legislative session, and “we know that approximately $5 million has not been allocated” to programs in the department’s Community Schools Bureau.
“These $5 million could be a lifeline for 21st Century Community Learning Centers that have been defunded,” Gates said. “We urge the Secretary of Education to identify the additional $5 million if this crisis continues to ensure that students and families have a safe and engaging place after 3 p.m.”
Source NM asked a spokesperson for the Public Education Department for comment and will update this story as needed.
The other states suing the Trump administration over the education freeze include Rhode Island, California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawai’i, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin; along with the District of Columbia.
The lawsuit points to eight other times in the last half year that federal courts have blocked the Trump administration from unilaterally freezing or withholding other kinds of federal funds, and asks the court to do the same here.
Alongside the lawsuit, the states also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which, if granted, would allow temporary relief while the lawsuit plays out. Torrez said a hearing on that motion has not yet been scheduled, and his office anticipates that will happen sometime in the next week.
If the states prevail in that hearing, Torrez said, the court would order the administration not to cut the funding and the status quo would remain.
“Finding quality help to make sure and childcare and after school programs that weighs on every parent’s mind,” he said. “How are you going to go and find out where your child is going to be in a way that’s safe, where they’re learning something? I’m trying to bring at least some reassurance to those families and those educators within the next several weeks, but this is something that is going to impact everybody.”

(Via STORMTOOLS)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined his second multistate lawsuit against President Donald Trump’s administration this week, signing on to a 20-state challenge against the dismantling of a key disaster mitigation program.
The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, means to undo the termination of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC) program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
Under BRIC, FEMA funds states, tribes, and local government projects that help fortify people and property against natural disasters. Funding can go toward things like flood barriers, building reinforcements, improving wastewater infrastructure, or hardening electric grids. The funds can also be used to prepare emergency plans or identify hazards within communities. FEMA typically covers up to 75% of a project’s cost, although smaller, rural communities can receive up to 90%.
In a statement Wednesday, Neronha said the program’s termination could hurt Rhode Island’s coastal communities.

“There’s no denying that Rhode Island is particularly susceptible to the ever-increasing effects of climate change, which is why we need to stay ahead of the curve on mitigating risk,” Neronha said. 
This is the Attorney General’s 27th legal effort against the Trump administration since January. Neronha is not a co-leader on Wednesday’s suit, unlike the one filed Monday in Rhode Island over education funding cuts. The suit is co-led by Attorneys General Andrea Joy Campbell of Massachusetts and Nick Brown of Washington.
Other attorneys general involved are from Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, as well as the governor of Pennsylvania. 
Since opening for applications in 2020, BRIC has funded over 2,000 projects with about $4.5 billion in funds. According to the lawsuit, the University of Rhode Island has been using BRIC money to develop a modeling tool for flood risks in Rhode Island’s coastal and inland waters. The project was allocated for fiscal years 2020 through 2023 and was awarded $976,488 across multiple BRIC grants, according to a January 2025 presentation made by the tool’s developers to a legislative study commission on climate change. The lawsuit cites a $348,978 grant for one project as being endangered by the BRIC termination.  
“URI’s BRIC project cannot move forward without BRIC funding,” the lawsuit reads. “As a result of the termination of the BRIC program, Rhode Island will have less data and information regarding inland flooding and inland flood risk.” 
The lawsuit alleges that BRIC’s suspension violates the separation of powers as well as the Administrative Procedure Act. Lawsuits against the Trump administration over funding cuts have frequently employed similar arguments.
“The President understands that he and his Administration do not have the power to unilaterally withhold Congressionally allocated funding to the states, and yet here we are again,” Neronha said in his statement. 
The lawsuit also argues that the elimination of BRIC defies the Appointments Clause of the Constitution. The official who ended the program — Cameron Hamilton, who served as acting administrator of FEMA from January until his firing in May — “was never nominated to serve as FEMA Administrator, nor was he confirmed by the Senate,” according to the suit.
Page not found
FEMA, which is itself an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, did not immediately return a request for comment about the lawsuit Wednesday. The agency posted a notice about the program’s termination to its website on April 4, although the link now returns a “Page not found” error as of this writing.
A cached version of the memo stored on Archive.org reads, “The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.” 
An April 16 memo clarified that FEMA would cancel applications for the 2024 funding cycle, as well as all BRIC projects not yet obligated from fiscal years 2020 through 2023, and annul obligated projects yet to begin construction. Unspent funds, which FEMA cited at over $3.6 billion, would be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund. The advisory noted that FEMA would craft a new mitigation strategy that is “more responsive to state and local requirements.”
Wednesday’s lawsuit claims that the abrupt termination of funding “has caused serious harm” as states are not able to move forward with projects and will end up wasting time, effort and money.
“Each day that passes causes more harm and increases the chances that these projects will not be able to go forward, as communities face expiring permits, escalating costs, and eroding stakeholder trust,” the suit reads.
FEMA’s efforts to harden communities against disaster began with pilot programs in the late 1990s, and were formalized in 2002 with the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, which also offered subsidies for mitigation. In response to Hurricane Katrina a year prior, Congress passed legislation in 2006 that furthered mitigation funding as one of FEMA’s key functions. In 2018, legislation reformed FEMA offerings to make them more consistent, and in September 2020, the first applications for the BRIC program opened.

(Dana DiFilippo | New Jersey Monitor)New Jersey is joining 19 other states in another lawsuit targeting the Trump administration, this time over the federal government’s decision to terminate a grant program that helps local and state governments prepare for natural disasters.
The Trump administration’s move to cut the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, run by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, would derail hundreds of projects and put communities nationwide at risk, the plaintiffs say in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court in Massachusetts.
Terminating the program unlawfully intrudes on Congress’s “power of the purse,” the plaintiffs allege. They also claim that the last two men to run the Federal Emergency Management Agency were not lawfully appointed, so they cannot end the program.
“It’s both illegal and it’s also incredibly irresponsible and callous to communities in New Jersey and across this country that are experiencing these devastating weather effects today,” Attorney General Matt Platkin told the New Jersey Monitor in an interview.
The lawsuit comes just two days after flash floods caused extensive damage in the region and led to at least two deaths in New Jersey.
“The threats of climate change, as we have seen in devastating flooding across the country and in New Jersey as recently as this week, are very real and are only going to get worse,” New Jersey Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette said in a statement.
The plaintiffs want a judge to issue a preliminary injunction barring the Trump administration from diverting money allocated to the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program.










The federal government exists for a reason. If it doesn’t exist to protect us from natural disasters, then what does it exist to do?


– Attorney General Matt Platkin


The program, which was approved by Congress in 2018 under President Trump’s first term, has provided approximately $4.5 billion over the past four years for long-term disaster resilience projects, funding floodwalls, evacuation routes and shelters, stormwater systems, wildfire defenses, and road and bridge fortification, the lawsuit says.
New Jersey slated funds from the program to strengthen a dam in Hunterdon County and to elevate water and fire pump systems at the Port Newark-Elizabeth Marine Terminal to make them flood-proof.
Federal officials announced the end of the program on April 4, calling it wasteful and politicized in a press release that has since been deleted from the Federal Emergency Management Agency website.
Platkin said that natural disaster relief has never been controversial, nor has the idea that the federal government should aid state and local governments in prevention and recovery efforts.
“The federal government exists for a reason,” he said. “If it doesn’t exist to protect us from natural disasters, then what does it exist to do?”
The lawsuit cites a 2007 Congressional Budget Office study that estimates for every dollar spent on pre-disaster mitigation, future losses are reduced by $3. Four states, including New Jersey, have saved $10 billion each in post-disaster relief costs because of the program, according to the lawsuit.

Doulas are maternal health professionals who provide emotional and physical support during and after pregnancy, labor and birth. Applicants who are expected to give birth before Dec. 1 will have three doula trainees to choose from and “are encouraged to interview multiple doulas to ensure the best personal fit by reviewing each doula’s specific service offerings,” according to the online application.
UAMS’ Institute for Community Health Innovation began the Doula Expansion Initiative as an effort to improve maternal and infant health throughout Arkansas, a state with consistently high maternal and infant mortality rates.
More than 60 trainees will complete the program later this year, according to Wednesday’s news release from UAMS announcing the program. The trainees are not UAMS employees but are “partnered with a mentor as they gain experience and work toward certification.”
Doula support during pregnancy and birth “significantly improves birth outcomes, including lower rates of interventions like cesarean sections and preterm births,” the release states.
Mothers in the following counties can apply for the program:

Increasing access to doula services in Arkansas was among the recommendations a maternal health task force made in September 2024. Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders convened the task force with the goal of improving the state’s maternal health care landscape.
In February, Sanders signed the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act, which allows health care providers throughout Arkansas to bill for doula services for the first time, among other things.",https://arkansasadvocate.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/People-holding-hands-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 18:08:30.565476

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ infant lithium industry will now have an industry-specific business accelerator to bolster emerging technology firms.
The Venture Center, an Arkansas entrepreneurial support organization, launched its Arkansas Lithium Technology Accelerator at a kick-off in El Dorado on Monday evening. Described as the first of its kind in the United States by the center’s executive director, Arthur Orduna, the accelerator is part of broader efforts at all levels of government to incentivize the growth of a lithium and critical minerals industry in South Arkansas.
The accelerator isn’t focusing on traditional lithium producers, such as Standard Lithium or Albemarle. Instead, it aims to develop companies within the broader battery industry to try to grow the supply chain downstream of lithium production itself, and then bring those companies to Arkansas.
The accelerator’s first cohort includes three companies operating within the lithium and battery supply chain:

Telescope Innovations — A Canada-based company that works on processing for critical minerals like lithium. It is a research and development partner with Standard Lithium, having done work on the company’s direct lithium extraction processes at its El Dorado demonstration plant, and recently worked with Standard on a process to produce lithium sulfide.
RAM Geothermal — A geothermal technology company.
Nano One — A Canada-based cathode company. It was awarded $12.9 million from the U.S. Department of Defense last year to expand its production and research facilities in Canada.

The Arkansas Legislature passed tax incentives during the 2025 session to lure lithium producers and businesses engaged in other parts of the battery supply chain to the state, and elected officials have touted Arkansas’ budding lithium industry and its potential economic effects on the South Arkansas region.
The accelerator hopes to make Arkansas the center of innovation for lithium technology. Participating companies take part in a three week program, which will connect them to Arkansas’ prospective lithium producers such as Standard Lithium and “academic, government and economic development partners,” according to a news release from the Venture Center.
Clint O’Neal, the director of the Arkansas Economic Development Commission, said lithium production meshes with what the state hopes to attract as part of its economic development efforts.
“What we’re doing today fits right in the sweet spot of our mission statement,” O’Neal said, adding later that “we look at lithium as an opportunity for such significant growth that we’re confident that Arkansas can be a major player in this industry.”
 Industry prospects 
Standard Lithium has said it expects to make a final decision on whether it will go forward with its planned project in Lafayette County by the end of 2025.
Arkansas Oil and Gas Commission approves first lithium royalty rate

Standard is already drawing down on a $225 million award it received from the U.S. Department of Energy in the waning days of President Joe Biden’s administration for the construction of the first phase of the project, Director of Government Jesse Edmondson said during the kickoff. Those funds were awarded as part of broader efforts by the Biden administration to boost critical mineral production in the U.S. in the face of Chinese dominance in the supply chain.
But the accelerator’s start also comes on the heels of the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminates the electric vehicle tax credits many Americans have used to transition from gas-powered to battery-powered vehicles.
Representatives of the companies in the cohort did not appear to be concerned that the roll back would affect industry prospects, however, despite these challenges.
Telescope’s Ryan Jansonius said that despite a “narrative” that EV adoption is happening slower in North America, more EVs were going to be sold in 2025 than in any previous year.
But potential growth in the EV market wasn’t the only reason the cohort was optimistic. Clean renewables such as solar and wind will require storage to make those reliable options compared to more polluting alternatives. Data centers for artificial intelligence will also need batteries, Nano One CEO Dan Blondal said.
Blondal said that the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act “is very focused on trying to drive” battery production to the U.S. and away from China, which currently dominates the battery industry, for use in the power-guzzling data centers that power AI.
While Blondal said it wouldn’t be immediate — “You don’t go from zero to starting to build a battery plant that can feed an auto plant,” he said — he anticipated that defense spending will kick-start the creation of battery supply chains in the U.S., and will eventually “lead to larger plants, more bankable projects, large projects with lots of construction jobs and ultimately lots of operational jobs.”
“The demand, or the projected demand, over the next ten years outstrips anything that’s being extracted right now,” Blondal said. “So from an Arkansas point of view, there will be outstripped demand for the next decade, at least. And I think that’s where there’s a tremendous amount of opportunity.”

(Photo courtesy of Friends of the Everglades/Ralph Awrood)The U.S. district judge assigned to the lawsuit to halt the state-run immigrant detention center in the Everglades recused himself on Wednesday, nearly three weeks after environmental groups asked the court to intervene.
Jose Martinez, a U.S. District Judge for the Southern District of Florida, was supposed to preside over the litigation from environmental groups alleging that construction of the detention center violates a federal law requiring analysis of potential harms and that the state and federal governments proceeded without public input.
The George W. Bush-appointed judge filed an order Wednesday, citing the federal statute outlining the circumstances under which federal judges must disqualify themselves from a case. He hadn’t taken action despite the Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity’s request on June 27 that he issue a temporary restraining order to stop the detention center located at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
Elise Bennett, an attorney for the Center for Biological Diversity, told Florida Phoenix that the suit had been reassigned to U.S. District Judge Kathleen Williams.
“This appalling situation needs immediate attention, and we’re hopeful Judge Williams will move quickly to review the case and rule on our motion to enjoin construction and operations at this cruel detention center,” Bennett wrote to the Phoenix.
The groups had asked Martinez to take action by Friday after submitting multiple declarations and photographs about the new pavement in the environmentally fragile site.
  Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier via Department of Legal Affairs
Most recently, Williams, an Obama appointee, found Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier in civil contempt of court over another immigration-related suit, where she barred the enforcement of the state’s illegal entry and re-entry laws. Williams repeatedly expressed frustration with Uthmeier’s disobedience of her order to bar arrests under the state law that led to the arrest of a U.S. citizen.
Since then, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Uthmeier have labeled Williams an activist judge. The governor appointed Uthmeier, his former chief of staff, to serve as the state’s top legal officer in February, after Ashley Moody’s ascension to the U.S. Senate.
The change in judges means that Williams could order a stop to the operation of the detention center that Uthmeier publicly announced and has used to boost his profile. The attorney general takes credit for naming of the detention center “Alligator Alcatraz,” which earned him praise from President Donald Trump.
“He’s even a good-looking guy,” Trump said of Uthmeier during a roundtable at the detention center on July 1. “That guy’s got a future.”
Two days ago, the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida requested to join the lawsuit as a plaintiff. All of the tribe’s active ceremonial sites and 15 villages are located within the Big Cypress National Preserve, where the detention center is.
Meanwhile, the federal government is skirting responsibility for the detention center in its attempt to ward off the lawsuit, stating in court filings that the site is state-run and the federal government didn’t authorize it.
Another lawsuit surrounding the detention center is also delayed. The Florida Supreme Court transferred on Monday to the state trial court in Tallahassee Democratic lawmakers’ complaint seeking access to conduct oversight visits.

Work begins at 3:30 p.m. Thursday when the first of five new study commissions created during the 2025 session kicks off with an inaugural organizational meeting. The Senate’s Special Legislative Commission to Study and Provide Recommendations for Potential Changes in Legislation/Oversight of the Act on Climate will review the 2021 decarbonization law, which set deadlines for incremental emissions reductions, eventually reaching net-zero by 2050.. 
Sen. Sam Zurier, a Providence Democrat sponsored the resolution to create the five-member study panel. In a prior interview, he said the legislative review intends to complement, not usurp, power from a separate consortium of state agencies charged with laying the framework for implementing the 2021 Act on Climate Law. The panel, which can have no more than four senators from the same political party, is required to issue a report outlining its review and recommendations no later than May 1, 2026.
The first meeting’s agenda calls for electing a chair person and a presentation from Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray. In addition to Zurier, other senators serving on the study commission are Democratic Sens. V. Susan Sosnowski, Mark McKenney, and Lammis Vargis, and Republican Gordon Rogers.
Initial meetings have yet to be scheduled for the four other study commissions set to begin in the coming months. They are:

A seven-member joint legislative study commission to consider the timeline and funding sources needed to return Central Falls Public Schools to city control. The school district has been under state control since 1991 amid severe financial strains, though the city has taken steps toward independence, including through a July 8 charter amendment setting up a nine-member, hybrid city school board. The study commission includes members from both chambers and outside education representatives. It must begin meeting by Aug. 31, and issue its recommendations to the Rhode Island General Assembly no later than March 3, 2026. Resolutions creating the panel were sponsored by Rep. Joshua Giraldo and Sen. Jonathon Acosta, both Central Falls Democrats.
An 11-member House study commission to study and recommend solutions to flooding of the Pawtucket River. Overflow from the river and watershed spanning 17 miles of the western side of the state caused severe flooding and damage in Warwick on at least two recent incidents of heavy rainfall, in December 2023 and January 2024. The study commission, which includes representation from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Rhode Island Emergency Management Agency is scheduled to report its findings no later than March 2, 2026 under the resolution sponsored by Rep. Earl Read III, a Warwick Democrat.
A 17-member House study commission to consider ways to improve educational outcomes for children in state care. The commission, created from a resolution sponsored by Rep. Julie Casimiro, a North Kingstown Democrat, comes amid a series of reports from the Rhode Island Department of Children, Youth, and Families, documenting low graduation rates among children in foster care and the “warehousing” of children with serious psychiatric needs at Bradley Hospital due to a lack of community care placements. The commission, which includes representation from state and local public schools, including a special education teacher and another teacher certified in trauma-informed care, must issue reported recommendations no later than July 1, 2026.
A 10-member House study commission to explore setting up a state-run program providing funding for low-income homeowners to make safety and energy efficiency repairs to their properties. The resolution from Rep. Arthur Handy, a Cranston Democrat, highlights the state’s aging housing stock — the third-oldest in the country according to a 2023 Rhode Island Foundation report — alongside the financial strain on homeowners to maintain and upgrade their properties. The panel, which includes representation from various state agencies and outside groups in building, housing and social services areas, must issue a report to the General Assembly no later than Jan. 5, 2026.

Every state has millions in school funding held up as a result of the freeze.Wednesday’s letter came after the Supreme Court temporarily cleared the way earlier this week for the administration to carry out mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the Department of Education that Trump ordered earlier this year.Just a day ahead of the July 1 date when these funds are typically disbursed as educators plan for the coming school year, the Education Department informed states that it would be withholding funding for several programs, including before- and after-school programs, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives.“Withholding these funds will harm students, families, and local economies,” wrote the 10 GOP senators, many of them members of committees that make decisions on spending. Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, a West Virginia Republican and chair of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies, led the letter.Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, chair of the broader Senate Appropriations Committee, also signed onto the letter, along with: Sens. Katie Britt of Alabama, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, John Boozman of Arkansas, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, Deb Fischer of Nebraska, John Hoeven of North Dakota, Mike Rounds of South Dakota and Jim Justice of West Virginia.“The decision to withhold this funding is contrary to President Trump's goal of returning K-12 education to the states,” the senators wrote. “This funding goes directly to states and local school districts, where local leaders decide how this funding is spent, because as we know, local communities know how to best serve students and families.”States Newsroom has asked the Office of Management and Budget for comment on the letter.Meanwhile, a slew of congressional Democrats and one independent — 32 senators and 150 House Democrats — urged Vought and Education Secretary Linda McMahon in two letters sent last week to immediately release the funds they say are being withheld “illegally.”Democratic attorneys general and governors also pushed back on these withheld funds when a coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia sued the administration earlier this week.",,,,2025-07-16 18:08:30.565476

(Photo Courtesy Immigration and Customs Enforcement)
The Immigration and Customs Enforcement Agency currently holds more than 58,000 people in jails nationwide, according to the most recent data, which is the highest number in at least five years amid President Donald Trump’s mass deportation push. 
The trend is reflected in three New Mexico detention centers that have agreements with ICE to house detainees, according to a Source New Mexico review of data from Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse compiled from ICE’s response to its records requests. The number of ICE detainees in detention centers in Torrance, Cibola and Otero counties has steadily increased since Adril. 
The TRAC data shows increases here every two weeks or so in the “average daily population” of detainees at each jail. That figure is the average number of detainees held each day divided by the number of days since Oct. 1, when the federal fiscal year began. (For example, if an ICE facility held four people on Oct. 1 and 6 people on Oct. 2, the average daily population on Oct. 2 would be 5.)
Sewage flooding cells inside Torrance County ICE prison again, advocates say

In two of three New Mexico jails with ICE agreements, the average number of daily detainees is the highest since at least September 2019, when TRAC first began publishing its detention numbers. Both have increased by more than 25% since this time last year. 
On June 23, the most recent date for which data is available, ICE held an average of 435 detainees at the Torrance County Detention Center in Estancia. A year ago, ICE held 341 ICE detainees there.
On June 23 at the Cibola County Detention Center in Milan, ICE held 227 detainees in custody. A year ago, it held 180. 
The Otero County Processing Center in Chaparral has not seen the same type of increase. It detains, by far, the most ICE arrestees in New Mexico. Its average population June 23 was 843. 
While the number of ICE detainees there has steadily increased along with the rest of the state and country in recent months, it’s only now approaching its September 2024 levels, according to a Source review. 
The processing center is dedicated to immigration detention and opened in 2008. 
All three detention centers have been the subjects of recent lawsuits and complaints regarding inhumane conditions for inmates. 
In Torrance County in early May, for example, advocates told Source that raw sewage was flooding cells. In Cibola County, the United States Attorney’s Office recently charged a corrections officer for colluding with a non-immigrant inmate to smuggle drugs into the jail. 
NM immigrant protectors stress ‘know your rights’ as funding boost supercharges ICE

As for Otero County, the Innovation Law Lab calls it “infamous,” saying thousands of detainees “have suffered within its walls, surviving inhumane conditions, woefully inadequate medical and mental health care, retaliation for speaking up, rampant due process violations, and other harms.”
Despite Trump’s promise of mass deportations, the increase in daily average inmates stayed the same for several months after he took office. Sophia Genovese, a Georgetown Law School professor who recently worked for the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center, recently told Source that approaching 60,000 detainees is a worrying trend, especially after President Trump signed a bill drastically increasing ICE’s budget for arrests and detentions. 
“When we hit 50,000 during his first administration, it was wild to see that,” Genovese said. “So now that we’ve got to 59 so quickly, it’s just kind of frightening to think about what’s going to happen six months from now.”
According to CBS News, a little less than half of the detainees have a criminal record, and fewer than 30% have been convicted of a crime.

(Photo by Tess Vrbin/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansas’ ban on “indoctrination” in public schools doesn’t violate students’ free speech protections because the government has a right to dictate what is taught, a federal appeals court panel ruled Wednesday.
The three-judge panel from the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a lower court’s ruling that blocked enforcement of part of Arkansas’ 2023 education overhaul law. The panel sent the case back to the district court for further proceedings.
U.S. District Judge Lee Rudofsky in May 2024 granted a preliminary injunction against the section of the LEARNS Act that prohibits “indoctrination” in public schools. Section 16 of the law specifically bans the teaching of “Critical Race Theory.” Rudofsky’s ruling applied only to the students who had sued, not the Little Rock High School teacher who was also a plaintiff in the lawsuit. 
The suit argued that the “indoctrination” section of the law violated the U.S. Constitution’s First and Fourteenth Amendments, which guarantee the rights of free speech and due process, respectively.
Arkansas officials appealed the preliminary injunction, arguing free speech protections don’t mean students can demand that public schools teach certain topics. The appellate panel agreed in its 18-page ruling, written by U.S. Circuit Judge L. Steven Grasz. Circuit Judges James B. Loken and Raymond W. Gruender were the other members of the panel.
“The students concede the classroom materials and instruction they seek to receive constitute government speech. This is fatal to their likelihood of success because the government’s own speech ‘is not restricted by the Free Speech Clause,’ so it is free to ‘choose what to say and what not to say,’” the panel said, quoting from a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court ruling in Shurtleff v. City of Boston.
“Since the Free Speech Clause does not give the students the right to compel the government to say something it does not wish to, they cannot show a likelihood of success,” the appeals court ruling said.
Attorney General Tim Griffin in a statement called the appeals court ruling “an important win for the LEARNS Act and for the rule of law. With its ruling today, the Eighth Circuit continues to ensure that the responsibility of setting curriculum is in the hands of democratically elected officials who, by nature, are responsive to voters.”
The panel also ruled the district court erred in granting the preliminary injunction based on the likelihood the students might succeed on their argument that the First Amendment protects a person’s right to receive information. While students have a free-speech right to receive information, they can’t dictate what schools include in their curriculum, the panel said.
“Though a listener’s right to receive information means the government cannot stop a willing private speaker from disseminating his message, that right cannot be used to require the government to provide a message it no longer is willing to say,” according to the appeals panel.
“We do not minimize the students’ concern … about a government that decides to exercise its discretion over the public school curriculum by prioritizing ideological interests over educational ones,” the panel wrote. “But the Constitution does not give courts the power to block government action based on mere policy disagreements.”
The First Amendment right to receive information doesn’t authorize a court to require the state to retain curriculum materials or instruction, “even if such information was removed for political reasons,” the ruling said. “Since the speech belongs to the government, it gets to control what it says.”
In spite of its ruling in favor of the state’s position, the panel noted: “Government speech is not immune from all constitutional challenges, and our holding does not suggest otherwise.”

 The due process argument

The district court’s preliminary injunction excluded the teachers who sued because, Rudofsky wrote, they did not show irreparable harm arising from Section 16 of the LEARNS Act.
 The teachers had argued the law forced them to self-censor in their classroom instruction, but Rudofsky ruled that the speech they were allegedly censoring was the state’s, not theirs. The teachers also argued that the law’s indoctrination section was so vague that it violated the Fourteenth Amendment’s due process clause.
The teachers filed motions in the appeal making similar arguments, but the appellate panel declined to consider the vagueness claim because the teachers didn’t file a separate appeal.

The spike, which hasn’t yet hit pre-pandemic levels, is driven by an increase in people detained while awaiting trial, according to Vermont Department of Corrections data.

Vermont’s prison population has hit a five-year peak. 
That’s according to new Vermont Department of Corrections data shared with lawmakers Wednesday in a key committee overseeing the criminal justice system. 
“This is a direct reflection of the court system and the backlog,” Jess King-Mohr, the department’s director of research and data analytics, said at the Joint Legislative Justice Oversight Committee meeting. 
Starting in 2020, as the Covid-19 pandemic altered all aspects of daily life, Vermont’s prison population plummeted by more than 500, to under 1,240 people. The reduction was due to  criminal justice reform legislation and Covid-conscious efforts — releases and limits on detainment — to prevent the disease’s spread in congregate settings.
But five years later, Vermont now incarcerates more than 1,550 people, a number corrections officials expect to continue growing. The spike is driven by people detained while awaiting trial.
Vermont’s courts have tens of thousands of cases on their dockets, according to state judiciary data. That backlog, coupled with new, stricter bail laws, are likely keeping more people locked up pre-trial. 
The male detained population — people incarcerated while awaiting trial — has increased by 60% since 2021, according to corrections department data. The women’s detained population skyrocketed by almost 150% in that time, leading the state to incarcerate more female detainees than sentenced women. 
Vermont’s total prison population as of July 2025. Vermont Department of Corrections
While federal detainees — especially those held for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement — have drawn most of the political scrutiny, state data indicates federal detainers make up a modest portion of the total spike. 
Vermont’s prisons lack the general population beds needed to hold every person the state incarcerates. An increase in the incarcerated population — especially men — has resulted in more people being sent out of state to the Tallahatchie County Correctional Facility in Mississippi, King-Mohr said, where Vermont holds a contract with a for-profit prison provider.
Nick Deml, the commissioner of corrections, also updated lawmakers on Vermont’s push to build a new women’s prison in Essex. State leaders and many advocates for incarcerated women say the current South Burlington facility’s ailing infrastructure does not lend itself to rehabilitation, problems exacerbated by a growing population. 
But according to Deml, work on a new prison isn’t going well.

“We’re at a bit of an impasse,” he said, describing the state’s work with the town of Essex. 
State leaders said they expect more information regarding zoning changes from Essex officials in September.

The lawsuit, brought by Democratic officials in 20 states, seeks to block the Federal Emergency Management Agency from eliminating its grant program to help states develop projects to protect residents from natural disasters such as floods, storms and wildfires.
The program, known as Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, has provided nearly $4.5 billion in funding for more than 2,000 projects around the country in the last four years, according to the lawsuit. 
In Connecticut, roughly $84 million of that funding, earmarked for local projects, is now at risk of being canceled, Tong said.
“We are midstream in a lot of these projects, and now they’re going to pull the rug out from under us,” Tong said. “Or we are about to break ground on projects, or these projects have to happen or else — or else people’s lives will be at risk.”
Tong announced his participation in the lawsuit in Stamford, near the site of a project to repair an aging seawall that was slated to receive $900,000 in federal funding through the BRIC program, city officials said.
The seawall, located along a canal, protects the city’s transfer station, sewage treatment plant and other critical infrastructure from flooding, officials said. The total cost of repairing the wall is estimated to be $12.7 million, split between federal, state and local governments. 
“Stamford is a coastal city, and we know that our sea levels are projected to rise by almost potentially two feet over the next several decades,” Mayor Caroline Simmons said. 
“We’ve taken a number of steps that enhance resiliency across our city, but particularly in the South End, to mitigate the effects of flooding,” she added. “We have a number of projects underway, one of them being to improve and upgrade our seawalls so that we can protect our residents and businesses from harm.”

A White House spokesperson referred comment to FEMA on Wednesday. Officials at the agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. 
In a since-deleted press release announcing plans to end the program in April, however, a FEMA spokesperson cast the BRIC grants as wasteful, ineffective and “more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.”
Tong has joined or led two dozen different lawsuits against the Trump administration since January, according to his office. Earlier this week, he joined with officials in 25 states in suing the Trump administration to release $6.8 billion in federal education funds. 
Wednesday’s legal action against FEMA was filed in federal district court in Massachusetts. In addition to FEMA, it named the agency’s acting administrator, David Richardson, and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem as defendants.
In a declaration that was filed as part of the lawsuit, Connecticut Department of Emergency Services and Public Protection Commissioner Ronnell Higgins said that canceling BRIC funds would have a “devastating” effect on the state through wasted time and money that has already been spent developing projects, as well as from harsher impacts from future storms.
Higgins identified two other projects that were impacted by FEMA’s plans to cancel its grant program: a coastal flood defense system in Bridgeport that was slated to receive $47 million in BRIC funding, and a $2.7 million project to assist the state in modernizing its building codes with newer, “hazard-resistant designs.”
The Bridgeport project, which aims to protect a pair of power-generating facilities, is also at risk of losing an additional $32 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Housing as a result of FEMA’s termination of its grants, Higgins said.
The BRIC grant program was created by a law signed by President Donald J. Trump during his first term in 2018, replacing an earlier disaster mitigation program.
In its announcement from earlier this year, FEMA said it was canceling grants that were approved during the Biden Administration between 2020 to 2023. The decision would return an estimated $882 million in unspent funds that had been dedicated to the program under the 2021 Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act to the Disaster Relief Fund or the U.S. Treasury, according to the agency. 
Earlier this year, Trump floated the prospect of eliminating FEMA altogether. More recently, following a devastating series of floods in Texas, officials have begun to walk back that idea, according to the Washington Post.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/TONG-LAWSUIT-0716-11-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 18:08:30.565476

Russ Fulcher, R-Idaho, speaks with Republican supporters at the Idaho GOP election night watch party at the Grove Hotel in Boise, Idaho, on Nov. 8, 2022. (Otto Kitsinger for Idaho Capital Sun)Just over a week after Congress passed a roughly 900-page tax and spending bill, called the “Big Beautiful Bill,” Idaho U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher fielded questions about it from constituents at a telephone town hall Tuesday evening. 
Fulcher touted the legislation, driven by President Donald Trump’s policy priorities, as achieving the president’s major goals including increasing funding for border security and immigration enforcement, extending tax cuts passed during the president’s first term, boosting domestic oil and gas while rolling back incentives for wind and solar production, and making major changes to Medicaid. 
“I think it’s really important to point out that we were able to bend the spending trajectory down, that was really important,” Fulcher said during the town hall. “The overall spending is not down, but the rate of growth is.” 
The Idaho callers also asked questions about immigration, federal land ownership and more. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
 Idaho constituent asks Fulcher about health care access 

A Coeur d’Alene man asked the congressman what he would do to improve access and affordability of health care. 
“I’m a cancer survivor,” the caller said. “I am the widow of a cancer fighter. I’ve lost parents that have needed lots of health care. … It’s so incredibly difficult to understand the cost of health care, to shop it, to try and find lower costs.” 
He said his son-in-law works as a social worker for Idaho Youth Ranch and cannot afford insurance for his wife and baby, and his wife has had to obtain their coverage through the state marketplace established through the Affordable Care Act. 
Fulcher, who acknowledged that he also survived cancer, said that health care control should shift more to the consumer.
“The government has gotten involved in our health care so much that what we’ve learned that the last thing you want is the collective me, as in we, making your health care decisions,” Fulcher said. 
He also highlighted the new work requirement for Medicaid added in part of the budget bill as a step toward keeping that program “solvent for the people it was targeted for.” 
Idaho health care advocates have argued the work requirement when implemented in other states tends to drop eligible participants through burdensome paperwork and reporting requirements rather than improving employment outcomes. 
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

Fulcher said his office was open to recommendations on improving access from constituents. 
Another caller suggested allowing health care plans to be purchased across state lines. 
“If I want to buy from a Florida company, why am I forced to buy one from Idaho? So we can compete and get prices down,” he said. 
Fulcher responded that he believes that change would need to be addressed locally. 
 Fulcher says he supports state management of federal lands

Benewah County Commissioner Bob Short asked if there were any proposals to compensate counties with large swathes of Native American reservation land — which do not generate property tax revenue for those counties. 
Fulcher noted that this is an issue local jurisdictions across Idaho face, because nearly two-thirds of the state’s land mass is owned by the federal government. However, some jurisdictions receive payment in lieu of taxes and money from the Secure Rural Schools program to provide districts with payments to offset lost property tax revenue. 
There is no equivalent program for counties that encompass reservations; the federal government holds the title for most of these lands, but the beneficial interest remains with the tribe, according to the U.S. Department of Interior. 
Fulcher said that any of these programs to offset costs are “becoming more and more difficult to get support for in Congress.” 
“And the reason why is, it technically is a subsidy from other states into Idaho,” Fulcher said. “And the states that don’t have all that federal land, and members of Congress that are from those states don’t want to subsidize us any more, so we’ve got a real challenge on our hands.” 
Fulcher went on to say he supported states taking over management of federal lands, such as those controlled by the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management. He said the agencies tasked with managing those parcels, which in Idaho totals more than 34 million acres, are “overwhelmed.” 
“We’ve got to somehow get more local stakeholder control, not necessarily transferring ownership, I’m not advocating for that,” he said. “Public lands need to stay public, but it needs to be controlled locally.”
Idaho legislators celebrate death of proposal to sell off public lands

Fulcher, a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, voted in favor of an amendment to the large budget bill that would have sold off thousands of acres of federal lands in Nevada and Utah, the Idaho Press reported. The proposal was later removed from the final bill. 
A fellow member of Idaho’s congressional delegation, U.S. Rep. Mike Simpson, proposed an amendment to block the sale; Fulcher voted against the amendment and was the only member of the delegation to not receive a thank you letter from Idaho Republican lawmakers for protecting public lands, the Sun reported. 
 Valley County commissioner advocates for legal immigration reform 

Fulcher highlighted that the budget bill supported tackling illegal immigration, but Valley County Commissioner Sherry Maupin asked the congressman what was going to be done to improve pathways for legal immigration. 
“Idaho does need workers,” Maupin said. “The illegal immigration issue has been so large for the last four years that we need to reform legal immigration.” 
Fulcher cited the past Farm Workforce Modernization Act, which would have provided a legal pathway for agricultural workers to receive temporary status with the option to eventually become a permanent resident. The bill passed the House in 2021, with Fulcher voting against it. 
He said Tuesday the bill stalled because the “border was opened up” under the policies of former President Joe Biden. Fulcher said the bill, which has been re-introduced this year with the support of Simpson, would be a likely starting point for potential reforms.

(Getty Images)For Wisconsinites who care about access to birth control, a new scorecard published Wednesday offers a mix of good and bad news.
On the plus side, Wisconsin’s Medicaid program covers the cost of contraception for people with incomes up to just over 300% of the federal poverty line, according to the Population Reference Bureau. State law also requires insurers to cover the cost of prescription contraceptives.
On the down side, Wisconsin law allows health insurance plans to require a patient co-payment, the Population Reference Bureau reports. And the state also hasn’t enacted legislation that allows more health care professionals to issue birth control prescriptions.
The Population Reference Bureau is a nonprofit, nonpartisan policy and research organization that describes its mission as improving people’s health and well-being through policies and practices rooted in scientific evidence.
Wednesday the bureau published its first-ever scorecard assessing contraceptive access for all 50 states and the District of Columbia.
Reviewing a collection of policies that address affordability,  availability and the environment of health care, the scorecard rates each state as protective, restrictive or mixed on contraception access. 
“Nearly 35% of Americans or 121 million people currently live in a state that actively restricts access to contraception through their policies,” said Cathryn Streifel, senior program director for the organization, in a briefing for reporters Tuesday. “This patchwork of policies creates a system where reproductive health care access depends on where you live.”
Broad access to contraception “is essential to helping people live with more freedom, health and possibility,” Streifel said — allowing people to have reproductive autonomy, making it possible for them to complete education and join the workforce, and contributing to economic stability. Contraception also reduces the risks for maternal and infant mortality and helps reduce public health costs, she added.
“We are at a moment where understanding state policy landscapes matters more than ever, because state policies are really shaping the reality of contraceptive access on the ground — especially because the federal protections are crumbling,” Streifel said.
Christine Power, a senior policy advisor with the organization, said the scorecard can help policymakers, advocates and the general public understand where each state stands.
The goal is “to ensure that this contraceptive policy is more transparent and actionable and to highlight both progress and gaps in access across the country,” Power said.
The scorecard rates 16 states and D.C. as protective for contraception access and 16 as restrictive. Wisconsin is one of 18 states with a mixed scorecard.
Wisconsin’s protective policies include the Medicaid coverage for family planning services. In addition, the state requires that hospital emergency rooms provide access to emergency contraception.
Wisconsin’s laws on sex education get a mixed rating. Positive points include  requiring medically accurate curricula, not requiring parental consent and not limiting sex ed to abstinence only. On the negative side, school districts are not required to offer sex ed.
The scorecard rates the state’s failure to fully expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act as restrictive, along with the failure to expand contraceptive prescription authority to more health providers. A bill that would allow pharmacists to prescribe birth control pills has passed the Wisconsin Assembly and is awaiting a vote in the state Senate.
On several other issues that the scorecard includes, Wisconsin has no policy.
The state doesn’t require insurers to cover an extended supply of contraceptives beyond three months, which increases a state’s score for being protective. Wisconsin also has no policies explicitly allowing minors to independently access contraceptive services or restricting them from doing so.
“Ten states restrict most minors from independently accessing contraceptive services,” said Power. “This policy creates additional hurdles for young people seeking to make informed decisions about their reproductive health, potentially leading to delayed care, unintended pregnancies, and negative long-term health outcomes.”
Wisconsin law is silent on whether health care providers or facilities can refuse to provide contraceptive services on religious or moral grounds. In other states, laws permitting that refusal are rated as restrictive.
The scorecard doesn’t rank the 50 states, but it does single out those with the highest scores for protection as well as those with the most restrictive policy framework.
Washington and California are the two states with the most protective contraception policies, Power said, while Kansas had the lowest score, with a mix of restrictive policies and the absence of any policy.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — A unanimous settlement agreement filed Tuesday at the Kansas Corporation Commission raises Evergy Kansas residential base rates by 9.6%.
A residential customer using about 900 kilowatt hours will see a net increase of about $9 per month on their bill, said Evergy spokeswoman Gina Penzig. That would be in addition to the recent KCC approval to build two natural gas plants and a solar plant, which is expected to increase residential rates 8.6%.
The next move is in the hands of the three-member KCC board, which will begin evidentiary hearings on the rate case Monday. The board is required to sign off on the unanimous agreement and may make changes.
Multiple parties intervening in the case signed off on the agreement, including attorneys representing industrial consumers, school districts, Walmart and businesses. 
The parties went into two days of discussions July 8 with vastly different opinions on how much Evergy Kansas Central should receive. The company asked for a $196.4 million rate increase, while intervenors’ proposals ranged from $115 million to $134.7 million. 
The parties reached agreement on a $128 million rate increase, which raises the base rates on schools and churches by 9.2% and on industrial customers by 8.4%. The settlement sets the return on equity for investors at 9.7%.
Jim Zakoura, president of the Kansas Industrial Consumers Group, represented the organization’s membership in the settlement meetings. While agreeing to the increase in rates, he raised concerns about how Evergy customers are seeing rates go up consistently.
“While we worked hard, along with others in the case, to reduce the amount of Evergy’s rate increase, because Kansas law permits increases to be based on spending levels by electric utilities, a rate increase on retail ratepayers could not be prevented,” Zakoura said in a statement.
He said recent increases are problematic, pointing to a rate increase of 9.3% attached to the company’s plan to build two natural gas plants and a solar plant, as well as general rate increases that pumped up rates 18% in less than two years.
“This is ‘rate shock’ not seen by Kansans since Wolf Creek began operation in 1985,” Zakoura said. “The extraordinarily high spending levels of Evergy, and the extraordinarily high spending levels directed by the Southwest Power Pool, will continue to require even higher retail electric rates for EKC retail ratepayers in the future.”
The Southwest Power Pool is the regional transmission organization that ensures reliable power supplies and infrastructure.
As news of the proposed settlement agreement circulated, research analyst Ross Fowler, of Bank of America Securities, sent out an email about Evergy stock.
“This settlement is relatively favorable, with an increase in ROE to 9.7% (vs. 9.4% prior), similar capital structure, and a significant portion of the company’s ask (65%),” he said. “Overall, this highlights that Kansas, a previously contentious regulatory environment, is getting better.”
Penzig said the company since its formation in 2018, when Westar Energy and Kansas City Power & Light merged, has kept rate increases “well below the rate of inflation.” The company was not allowed to ask for any rate increases for five years after the merger. 
“Evergy and parties to our rate case reached a constructive agreement that allows recovery of investments made to provide reliable service to our Evergy Kansas Central customers,” Penzig said. “We continue to make our costs more competitive while investing in infrastructure needed to ensure reliable service and support growth in our communities.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/P1090640-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-16 18:08:30.565476

Article Summary

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi raised the most money in the first quarter of fundraising for the 2026 Illinois Democratic primary for U.S. Senate and has already launched a TV ad.
Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton received money from some of the most politically connected donors in state politics, from Gov. JB Pritzker to lobbyists and owners of Chicago sports teams.
U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly had the lowest fundraising total but has more than $2 million available.
Ten other candidates in both parties have also filed federal campaign committees but did not report substantial contributions.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


TV advertising has already begun in Illinois' 2026 Democrat primary for U.S. Senate, and new fundraising numbers released Tuesday show the race is shaping up to be expensive.

The quarterly reports submitted to the Federal Elections Commission shed light on how candidates are spending money as well as who is contributing to them. Donations are pouring in for U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly and Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton — the three most high-profile Democrats so far to launch their campaign.

Gov. JB Pritzker has already put his thumb on the scale of the race, endorsing Stratton a day after she launched her campaign in April. But the billionaire governor has a financial stake in the contest as well.

Pritzker contributed $3,500 to Stratton’s primary campaign, and another $3,500 earmarked for the general election. It’s the maximum amount allowed in an election cycle for an individual contribution under federal rules, meaning he can’t contribute anything close to the $300 million he’s dumped into his own campaigns for governor.

Pritzker can still find other avenues to financially support Stratton later, such as through a dark money political action committee he launched in 2023. And he wasn’t the only Pritzker to donate to Stratton. His wife, MK, his two adult children, and his cousins Adam, John, Gigi and Jennifer, all contributed the maximum $7,000. Jennifer Pritzker is a former supporter of President Donald Trump who has more recently supported Democratic candidates.

Kelly vs. Pritzker round 3

The race has also set a third battle between a Pritzker ally and Kelly.

Underlying the contest is Kelly’s past history as chair of the Democratic Party of Illinois. She was elected party chair in 2021 against Pritzker backed candidate and Chicago Ald. Michelle Harris to replace Mike Madigan who bowed out of the job after losing the speakership that year. But the following year, Kelly ended her bid for reelection as party chair after it became clear she would not have enough support to beat State Rep. Lisa Hernandez, D-Cicero, for the leadership role. Hernandez was also backed by Pritzker.

Kelly, of Matteson, argued a lot of people on the party’s state central committee “were sad to see me go.”

“The people in the party, they know me, they know the work that I’ve done,” Kelly told Capitol News Illinois last week. “Despite what happened, I’ve still been an effective leader. I’m the only one that’s been an effective leader on every level of government and has delivered on every level.”

Kelly says money isn’t going to decide the race.

“They have a lot of money, but you know what, I’m just using every opportunity to tell my story and I don’t feel like I need the most money in the race to win the race because I feel like I have an excellent story to tell,” Kelly said.

Between her two campaign committees for her U.S. House seat and a new committee for her Senate bid, Kelly raised $565,775 from April 1 through June 30 and has $2 million in her campaign accounts.

Her donors include a lengthy list of corporate political action committees, many local officials in her 2nd Congressional District, and some notable names in Illinois government. They include former state Sen. Jacqueline Collins, Chicago Fire Department Commissioner Annette Nance-Holt and Cook County Clerk Monica Gordon. Gordon also contributed to Stratton’s campaign.

Stratton’s contributions

Stratton’s cash balance of $666,416 is the smallest in the race, as it is her first time running for federal office and first time running for office alone since she was a state representative in 2016. She raised just over $1 million since launching her campaign in late April.

Stratton has pledged not to take any money from corporate political action committees, though Krishnamoorthi and Kelly have received such donations. She returned a contribution from the central Illinois energy company Marquis Energy’s PAC, although accepted contributions from several Marquis family members who hold top leadership positions at the company, according to FEC filings.

The rest of her list of donors is a “who's who” of Illinois Democrats.

Stratton has touted many endorsements from members of the General Assembly in recent days and 12 have contributed to her campaign. The list also includes many Lake County Democrats, including State’s Attorney Eric Rinehart, Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering, and county party chair Lauren Beth Gash.

Stratton also received support from owners of most of the city’s sports teams: Cubs co-owner Laura Ricketts and her wife; White Sox and Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf, along with his son and Bulls President Michael Reinsdorf; and Blackhawks CEO Danny Wirtz.

Other donors come from all sectors of state politics, including Sen. Tammy Duckworth, former legislators, high-profile lobbyists and consultants, Pritzker’s top political advisor, business executives, and lawyers at Chicago's top law firms.

Some donors also hold positions in state government, including Department of Human Rights Director Jim Bennett and the Department of Labor's top attorney, Deborah Baker.

Stratton has also formed her own political action committee called “Level Up.” Fundraising numbers for the committee have not yet been released as political action committees follow a different reporting schedule than campaigns.

Krishnamoorthi continues strong fundraising

Krishnamoorthi, of Schaumburg, has been one of the most prolific fundraisers in Congress, reporting millions of dollars in contributions every quarter. His first months running for Senate were no different.

Krishnamoorthi raised just shy of $3 million between his House campaign account and new Senate campaign account. Candidates running for a new federal office are generally allowed to transfer funds from their old campaign to their new campaign. In total, Krishnamoorthi has $21 million on hand.

“I'm just blessed to have a lot of individual donors throughout Illinois and elsewhere who believe in my mission,” Krishnamoorthi told Capitol News Illinois.

The March 17, 2026, primary is still eight months away, but Krishnamoorthi launched the election cycle’s first TV ad on Tuesday, which cost $500,000 for the first week, according to his campaign. It’s airing in TV markets around the state and on digital platforms.

The 30-second segment serves as an introduction of Krishnamoorthi, who currently represents the 8th Congressional District in the northwest suburbs. It portrays him as a fighter against “bullies,” which is how he describes Trump.

“When I see underdogs hurt by a rigged system, I fight back ... Bullies like Trump can call us names, but you can just call me Raja,” Krishnamoorthi says in the ad, playing off his “just call me Raja” slogan that has been a hallmark of his TV advertisements since he first ran for Congress in 2016.

Most of Krishnamoorthi’s fundraising came from individual donors and less than $200,000 was from political action committees. But unlike his opponents, he had very few donors who are involved in state politics. One of the most notable names contributing to his campaign was Vinai Thummalapally, a former ambassador to Belize.

Other candidates 

Six Republicans have filed as candidates with the Federal Elections Commission but did not raise substantial amounts of money. They include Casey Chlebek, a former IT professional who is active in Polish-American civic groups; Douglas Bennett, who ran unsuccessfully in the 10th Congressional District in 2018; Air Force veteran John Goodman; Pamela Denise Long, an occupational therapist and former political commentator for Newsweek; former Illinois International Port District board member Cary Capparelli, and Westchester resident Panagioti Bartzis.

On the Democrat side, four other candidates have filed with the FEC: Kevin Ryan, a Marine veteran and diplomat; Christopher Swann, a program manager for Feeding America; Carmi resident Stan Leavell, and Awisi Bustos, CEO of the Illinois Alliance of Boys and Girls Clubs.

Bustos is daughter-in-law of former U.S. Rep. Cheri Bustos, who represented the 17th Congressional District for 10 years. Cheri Bustos is not supporting Awisi Bustos’ campaign amid an ongoing divorce case, the D.C. insider newsletter Punchbowl reported.

Fire officials are developing a strategy to protect values while providing for safety of firefighters and the public,” a Wednesday afternoon update from the Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1 said about the Turner Gulch fire.

The fire was caused by lightning on July 10. Winds have stoked the blaze in recent days.
There will be a community meeting about the fire at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the Gateway Community Center at 3270 D½ Road. The meeting will also be livestreamed on the Turner Gulch and Wright Draw Fires incident Facebook page.



The Mesa County Sheriff’s Office ordered evacuations on Tuesday afternoon between mile markers 131 and 134 along Highway 141. Evacuees can get resources and housing help at the Clifton Community Campus. Those who need help sheltering large animals should call 970-778-0161.
There is an ongoing air quality health advisory for Mesa, Garfield, Eagle, Pitkin, Lake, Delta, Gunnison, Chaffee, Montrose, San Miguel and Ouray Counties. The Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment recommends staying indoors or limiting outdoor activity when moderate to heavy smoke is present.
The South Rim fire at Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park is at 4,160 acres as of Wednesday afternoon. The park remains closed to visitors.
The Snowbelly fire in the Dominguez Canyon Wilderness Area in Delta and Mesa counties is at 2,274 acres and was 13% contained late Wednesday morning.

The search warrant affidavit alleges that the companies being funded by the program — which are supposed to provide housing assistance to vulnerable populations — took millions in Medicaid money while providing few services. KARE 11 spoke to one client who never met anyone from their service provider, Pristine Health, despite the fact that the company had billed Medicaid 46 times for its services. 
Minnesota first launched the program in 2020, estimating that it would cost $2.6 million per year. Claims exploded, however, reaching more than $104 million by 2024, according to the search warrant affidavit.  
The housing stabilization investigation is just the latest suspected fraud across a range of Minnesota safety net programs in recent years, from pandemic-era food aid to services for autistic children to transportation of patients to health care providers. The pattern is consistent: A new program or an increase in funding for an existing program — often lightly regulated — leads to an explosion of providers and billings.
Dozens of housing stabilization providers were already being investigated in May, KARE 11 reported. Legislators increased requirements for housing stabilization agencies in response to fraud concerns, including mandating further documentation of services and limits on hours.

Prosecutors are calling on a federal judge to reject a request from attorneys of Teresa Youngblut to delay their decision-making process as they consider whether to bring charges that carry the death penalty in the fatal shooting of a U.S. border patrol agent in Vermont. 
Youngblut’s attorney submitted a filing last month in federal court in Burlington seeking additional time from a deadline of this later this month to offer mitigating evidence on their client’s behalf. 
Prosecutors responded in a 17-page filing this week that Judge Christina Reiss should not grant Youngblut’s defense team an extension from the July 28 deadline the prosecution had set.

Granting the defense’s request, the prosecutors wrote, would “violate the separation of power” principles and “infringe on the Executive Branch’s exclusive prosecutorial discretion in deciding whether (to) charge a death eligible offense or to seek the death penalty in this case.”
The government process to determine whether to seek the death penalty “is an internal process in which the defendant has no cognizable right to participate beyond the Executive Branch’s invitation,” the prosecutors added.
Reiss has yet to rule on the matter as of Wednesday afternoon.
Youngblut, 21, of Washington, who was also hurt in the Jan. 20 shootout in northern Vermont, has been held in custody since receiving treatment for injuries at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire.
Youngblut has already been charged with federal firearms and assault offenses stemming from the shootout on Interstate 91 in Coventry that killed U.S Border Patrol Agent David Maland. According to court filings, Maland conducted a traffic stop that afternoon on a vehicle Youngblut had been driving.
During that traffic stop, according to charging documents, Youngblut came out of the vehicle and opened fire, leading to an exchange of gunfire with law enforcement at the scene. 
Maland was killed in the shootout, as was Felix Bauckholt, a German national who was a passenger in the vehicle Youngblut was driving. 
Youngblut has not been specifically charged with firing the shot that killed Maland. Federal authorities leading the investigation into the fatal shooting have refused to confirm who fired the fatal shot that killed Maland. 
Prosecutors in their latest filing this week provided a similar summary of the shootout as they have in past court submissions, and again did not directly state that Youngblut fired the fatal shot. Instead, prosecutors wrote, as they have in the past, that he was killed in an “exchange of gunfire.” 
Youngblut and Bauckholt allegedly had ties to a group of people known as the “Zizians.” Members of the group have been connected to several other homicides across the country, including in California and Pennsylvania.
Youngblut’s defense team has argued that a meeting called for by the prosecution for them to meet with the U.S Attorney General’s Capital Case Review Committee was too soon. They asked that the meeting be pushed back until at least January 2026. 
That committee screens cases and makes recommendations to the U.S. Attorney General’s Office on whether to seek charges that carry the death penalty. 
Prosecutors cited in their response the case of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who was convicted and sentenced to death for the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing that left three people dead and hundreds injured.
In that case, prosecutors wrote, attorneys for Tsarnaev asked for additional time to submit mitigating evidence ahead of a death penalty decision.
“In denying the defendant’s request” in that case, the prosecutors wrote, “the court recognized that the death penalty protocol’s inclusion of an opportunity for the defendant to submit information and materials for consideration in the Department’s internal deliberations was ‘prudent policy, but is not required by any constitutional, statutory, or decisional rule of law.’”
Prosecutors in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for Vermont who are handling the case, through a spokesperson, declined comment on the latest filing Wednesday. 
Steven Barth, an attorney for Youngblut, could not be reached for comment Wednesday.

(Photo by Shaun Chornobroff/SC Daily Gazette)The long list of candidates seeking to challenge sitting U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham continues to shift.
A week after Democrat Brandon Brown announced he would run, a different Democrat, Lee Johnson, suspended his campaign.
This brings the total field to seven challengers from the two major parties — two Republicans and five Democrats — according to federal elections filings.
“As the Democratic primary has taken shape, it has become clear that now is the time for unity,” Johnson wrote in a statement Wednesday halting his two-month-long run.
“This was not an easy decision. But as Democrats prepare to challenge Lindsey Graham in 2026, the best thing I can do to help in that fight is support the candidate our party selects,” the Upstate engineer and businessman added.
His campaign spent about $117,000 during his short bid, after he loaned himself $500,000 for the launch and raised $67,000, according to a July 15 filing.
Meanwhile, Brown entered the race with a pledge to fight against tariffs enacted by the Trump administration and cuts to Medicaid.
Brown, of Taylors, has worked in recruitment and fundraising for several historically Black colleges and universities, including Claflin University, Jackson State University in Mississippi, and Paine College in Augusta, Georgia.
Brown also worked on former President Joe Biden’s first presidential campaign against Barak Obama in 2006. And in 2004, he ran to represent South Carolina’s 4th Congressional District covering the Upstate. He lost out to former Republican Rep. Bob Inglis, who won with 70% of the vote.
Former SC Lt. Gov. Bauer challenging U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham: ‘I am the real Trump guy’

All candidates taking on Graham are going up against his major fundraising capacity. Graham has already raised and spent more than $2 million in the past three months, according to his campaign filings. That leaves him with a war chest of more than $15.6 million, almost matching what he had on hand at end of last quarter.
In 2020, Graham easily defeated three GOP challengers before taking on Democrat Jaime Harrison, who lost by double digits in what was then the most expensive U.S. Senate race in history.
Greenville businessman Mark Lynch, owner of Jeff Lynch Appliance Center, launched his campaign in February to challenge Graham in the GOP primary. After putting $5 million of his own money into the campaign and raising nearly $200,000, the Republican has so far spent his donors’ funds and is running TV ads to boost his profile.
Democrat Annie Andrews, a pediatrician in the Lowcountry, has raised $1.2 million to date and spent nearly half of that on campaign expenses.
Democrat Kyle Freeman has spent $25,000 of his own money, with just $650 cash left on hand.
The other announced challengers, including former Lt. Gov. Andre Bauer, have not yet filed financial reports with the Federal Election Commission.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5375-1024x689.jpg,,,2025-07-16 18:08:30.565476

(Photo by Anne-Marie Caruso and courtesy of NorthJersey.com)A federal appeals court has halted the deportation of a New Jersey imam who has been in the United States since 1996, and accused the federal government of overstepping its authority by trying to rescind his green card after missing its deadline to do so.
The U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals said in a 2-1 ruling on Tuesday that it has “grave concerns” with the Board of Immigration Appeals ignoring judges’ factfinding, flouting its own regulations, and penalizing the imam, Mohammad Qatanani, for “quintessential First Amendment activity.” But it found an even more fundamental problem: the immigration appeals board attempted to revoke Qatanani’s legal status after missing a deadline.
“To permit an agency to expand its power in the face of a congressional limitation on its jurisdiction would be to grant to the agency power to override Congress,” Judge Arianna J. Freeman wrote in the majority opinion, joined by Judge Cheryl Ann Krause.
The ruling is a win for Qatanani, a longtime imam of the Islamic Center of Passaic County in Paterson whose legal battle to remain in the country has spanned more than two decades.
In 1993, prior to immigrating to the United States, Qatanani was detained, beaten, and interrogated by the Israeli military in the West Bank. A military court convicted him of being a member of Hamas, and he served three months in prison.
Qatanani arrived here in 1996 on an HI-B visa — which allows skilled workers to work in the United States — and applied for permanent legal status in 1999. On that application, he checked a box saying he had not been arrested or imprisoned for violating a law or ordinance in or outside the United States.
The federal government denied his application for lawful status in 2006, citing his conviction in Israel and saying he had made a material misrepresentation.
Immigration courts twice rejected the government’s move to remove Qatanani, stating the Israeli court documents were “highly questionable” with “very low evidentiary weight,” and that they found it perplexing and “remarkable” that the Israeli military would convict a member of Hamas, then release him after three months and renew his West Bank residency card. Those courts also cited a distinction between arrest and administrative detention under Israeli military court regulations in effect in 1993 in the West Bank.
Federal officials seeking Qatanani’s deportation have cited a speech he gave during a Times Square rally in December 2017. Qatanani in those remarks stated his opposition to President Trump’s push to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. He also issued a call for a “new intifada.”
Those comments equated to a call for violence, federal officials said. Qatanani said he was not advocating violence and only promotes peaceful methods of political opposition. Immigration courts sided with Qatanani.
In April 2020, after a second immigration court granted Qatanani legal status, the government had 30 days to appeal the decision. It did not.
Four months later, the Department of Homeland Security filed an appeal, and the Board of Immigration Appeals sought to undo the most recent ruling granting Qatanani permanent legal status. Qatanani then appealed.
Freeman wrote that the immigration appeals board’s move to rescind Qatanani’s legal status was an “end-run” around procedures authorized by Congress.
Permitting the appeals board to rescind status outside of the process Congress provided would also violate due process protections offered to noncitizens with status, along with subjecting them to live in a constant state of insecurity, the ruling says.
“It would eliminate the security that attends LPR status, undermining Qatanani’s ability to rely on his status to make decisions about home, family, community, and career in this country,” Freeman wrote.
She noted that the court is unaware of any other cases besides this one in which the appeals board attempted to make such a decision after the Department of Homeland Security failed to file a timely appeal. Further challenges to lawful protected resident status should go through Congress’s designated rescission procedures, she wrote, rather than agency workarounds.
She stressed the board’s stated authority to retroactively nullify Qatanani’s lawful status “runs afoul of the well-settled principles of finality and due process.”
Judge Paul B. Matey, in a dissent, criticized the majority for what he characterized as judicial overreach, warning the decision would strip immigration authorities of powers to protect the United States and undermine executive powers.
“Due regard for the political questions inherent in immigration leaves no room for judicial policing over policy,” he wrote.

Ron DeSantis in Tampa on July 16, 2025. (Photo by Mitch Perry/Florida Phoenix)The state of Florida has a new chief financial officer, and the Republican Party of Florida has a new schism in its ranks leading to next year’s primary election for that seat.
That’s apparent now that, as anticipated, Gov. Ron DeSantis on Wednesday appointed Hernando Republican state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia to serve as Florida’s next chief financial officer. The position had been vacant for the past three-and-a-half months after former CFO Jimmy Patronis stepped down upon his election to Congress in Florida’s First Congressional District on April 1.
An extremely close ally of the governor, Ingoglia was always the inside pick for the governor to fill the position. In choosing him, DeSantis bypassed Sarasota Republican state Sen. Joe Gruters, who has previously declared his candidacy for the seat, which is up for election in 2026. Ingolia already has the backing of Donald Trump, making him the early front runner for the nomination.
DeSantis said he wanted someone in the job who holds conservative principles and is “dedicated to the mission.” He extolled Ingoglia’s conservative record on issues like illegal immigration, voting integrity, and cracking down on human trafficking.
Who is Blaise Ingoglia?
Ingoglia is a native New Yorker and homebuilder who moved to Spring Hill (about 50 miles north of Tampa) in the mid-1990s. He was elected to the Florida House in 2014 and simultaneously served as Republican Party of Florida chairman from 2015 to 2019. He has been in the Senate since 2022.
He began his remarks by saying that he had told DeSantis some time ago that he had been considering a run for higher office and that the governor had predicted it would be the CFO spot.
“The governor knows how much I care about spending,” he said. “He knows how much I care about spending less and having better outcomes, and sometimes that is the opposite of what government does. But that’s never stopped me. I have a history of calling out wasteful spending, whether it was Democrats or Republicans. Because I truly believe that government is accountable to the people and our job is that we deliver that promise.”
Ingoglia has already appeared with DeSantis on several occasions this year in roundtable discussions pushing for property tax reform, and said that will continue over the next year. “I’m going to work hand and glove, side by side with this governor to make sure that we get rid of property taxes on homestead exemption and offer real property tax relief to the people of the state of Florida,” he said.
Sounding already like a candidate making his case before the voters, Ingoglia said that he would continue to work on the property insurance issues that are a big part of his job description, as well as housing affordability.
“If an insurance company does not do what they say they are going to do and contractually obligated to do, I am going to call you out,” he threatened. “I am going to make sure that people know that the CFO will stand with people against unscrupulous insurance companies who are not doing what they are supposed to be doing.”
What the CFO does
The chief financial officer of Florida is one of three Cabinet-level positions in state government, along with the attorney general and agriculture commissioner, and goes up for election every four years. Together, they help the governor administer a number of state agencies.
The CFO is the statutory head of the Department of Financial Services, which oversees more than a dozen state agencies, including the State Fire Marshal, Consumer Services, and Inspector General. The position pays $140,000 a year.
Patronis had served as Florida’s CFO from the time he was appointed by then-Gov. Rick Scott in 2017 until March 31, 2025, when he resigned a day ahead of his successful election to Congress. Since then, the seat has stood empty. That void bothered Patronis, who told Matt Gaetz’ talk-show last month that he was concerned.
“I watched every single dollar, I could audit every single transaction, I could question any finances anywhere in the state if it’s taxpayer related,” Patronis said. “Without a CFO in place, who in the hell is doing the business of the people?”
Taking questions from reporters after the announcement, DeSantis pounced when asked why he didn’t pick the already Trump-endorsed Gruters for the position.
“Blaise has done what the voters who’ve elected us expect,” the governor said. “Joe Gruters has taken major positions that are totally contrary from what our voter base wants to do. So when it comes to making an appointment, I have to go on the record. I can tell you that if Blaise supported the [House Speaker Daniel] Perez/Gruters [immigration] amnesty bill? He would not be standing on this stage today. That’s just the truth. And I like him personally, but it doesn’t matter — it’s all about the record.”
To make his point, DeSantis avowed that even if George Washington rose from the dead and patted him on the shoulder and said he should appoint Gruters to the CFO spot, he wouldn’t be able to do it.
“My response would be, ‘No, I can’t do that without betraying the voters that elected me to lead the state in a conservative direction,'” he said.
Among the votes and issues that DeSantis recounted were Gruters’ vote for the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act in 2018, which Ingoglia opposed and that included provisions such as raising the age to purchase a long gun from 18 to 21; adding a three-day wait period between the purchase and delivery of a firearm (or until the background check is completed); and a red-flag law preventing persons at a high risk from harming themselves or others from possessing firearms. (Second Amendment advocates have maintained that provision is unconstitutional).
DeSantis also noted Gruters’ opposition to a 2023 bill that eviscerated many of Florida’s public sector unions, and his support for the 2024 proposed state constitutional amendment that would have legalized recreational cannabis.
“Gruters sided with the mega-weed company Trulieve and was joining with liberal Democrats to try to do it, so his record is contrary to what we’ve told the voters what we would do.”
Gruters vs. Ingoglia
The Gruters campaign declined an opportunity to respond to DeSantis’ remarks, but made their biggest statement the day before the press conference, issuing a press release reporting that they were hiring two of Trump’s top political advisers — 2024 campaign co-manager Chris LaCivita and pollster Tony Fabrizio.
“The choice between a MAGA-first patriot and a Never-Trumper is never really a choice,” said LaCivita, noting that Ingoglia did not endorse Trump in 2016 or 2024, when he was strongly backing DeSantis for the Republican nomination for president. “I’ve worked with Joe Gruters for years and can say that  few have done more in Florida to advance the America First agenda.”
Gruters is a Sarasota CPA who also served as the Republican Party of Florida chair, succeeding Ingoglia in leading the state party from 2019 until 2023. He was initially elected to the Florida House in 2016 and to the state Senate in 2018.
A public opinion survey conducted earlier this week of 763 Republican voters by St. Pete Polls showed Gruters crushing Ingoglia in a head-to-head matchup by nearly 50 percentage points, 60%-10%, with 30% undecided. Frank William Collige and Benjamin Horbowy have also filed to enter the Republican CFO primary, according to the Division of Elections. No Democrat has entered the race yet.
Fentrice Driskell, the Florida House Democratic Leader, issued a statement following DeSantis’ appointment of Ingoglia.
“Floridians deserve a CFO who will stand up to the insurance companies and help make property insurance more affordable,” she said. “Instead, Ron DeSantis is appointing a Tallahassee politician more loyal to him than to the people. I believe Blaise Ingoglia will talk tough but continue the tradition of giving the insurance companies everything they ask for while Florida’s working families and seniors pay the price.”
She went on to note that while Ingoglia says he wants to fight wasteful spending, he was “gleefully cheerleading the $450 million Everglades detention camp” last weekend.
“He also has a long history in the legislature of working to make it harder to vote and promoting partisan stunts like trying to outlaw the Democratic Party,” she added.

Organizers expect about 70,000 fans for the three-day WNBA All-Star Weekend, and about 88,000 across the Indiana Black Expo’s 11-day Summer Celebration, WISH TV reported.
“We are going to take every additional precaution to ensure” the basketball game is safe, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun assured reporters. “Hoosiers and visitors alike can know it’s going to be a place where they’re going to enjoy the weekend, and thanks to our own Indiana State Police … we will make sure that that happens.”
The festivities approach shortly after a bloody Independence Day weekend. At least 30 people were shot, five fatally, according to the Indianapolis Star.
Braun blamed Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett and Prosecutor Ryan Mears, both Democrats. He declined to say if he’d spoken with either about his concerns or offer examples.

“I’m not going to go into the details of that. I think you can extrapolate that broadly,” he told reporters. “I think the prosecutor has not taken up cases that the police bring to them, and the proof is in how things are being done. So it’s up to them if the state’s going to come in and start making these decisions or having a collaboration.”
Braun noted that the recent and upcoming state police deployments stemmed from Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department requests. That department has also amped up enforcement of a youth curfew downtown after the deadly shootings.
“Officers of the IMPD, when they had to call out for help, when it sounded like the shootout at the O.K. Corral here a few weeks ago, (state police) were gracious to come in, and it did the job, but that’s not the way it should be done,” Braun said.
Scott said he wouldn’t share “any details of our operational plans” for the weekend beyond “a significant increase in the number of troopers patrolling downtown Indianapolis.”
Governor’s office spokeswoman Molly Craft said they don’t have an anticipated cost, but that Indiana State Police will cover the tab.

(Perry Bennett | West Virginia Legislative Photography)A West Virginia Republican lawmaker is denying that he authored a letter to the state’s congressional delegation about the need for federal flood aid for the northern part of the state. 
Del. Charles Sheedy Sr., R-Marshall, is the second West Virginia Republican lawmaker this summer to say his social media account had been compromised, resulting in a statement he didn’t make. 
The letter allegedly from Sheedy was reported by the TV news station WTRF Tuesday and was posted Monday by Charles Sheedy’s personal to the Facebook group “Marshall County WV Republican Club.” It questioned why Ohio and Marion counties have not yet received a disaster declaration from the federal government a month after flooding swept through the area, killing nine people. 
“Constituents in District 7 are asking why President Trump has not issued a FEMA Disaster Declaration for Ohio and Marion Counties?” the letter says. It contained multiple typos. “My constituents are also yours and they deserve an answer since approximately 78% of all West Virginians that voted did so for President Trump. It is very apparent that the President does not need West Virginia now that he is in office for one term.”
Then, it raised concerns that the lack of declaration could lead to Republicans losing seats.
“Our very elections in 2026 and beyond depend on the timely issuance of this deceleration and Republican seats could be lost,” the letter said. “This will cost our Delegate districts, Senate Districts, your Federal Districts needed representation to accomplish our work to secure the region, state, and nation.”
Reached via email Tuesday, Sheedy responded that he did not write the letter. 
A Facebook account with the name Delegate Sheedy posted, “Apparently my page has been hacked. I have changed my password and am assured it will not happen again by FB. This is my letterhead. The other I was shown is old and no longer in use.” The account has now been deleted.
Sheedy told West Virginia Watch that he did not write the letter and has deleted his “delegate account,” referring to his professional Facebook account. There were two versions of the letter with slight formatting differences and different lists of committees that Sheedy serves on in the House of Delegates.
However, a spokesperson for Gov. Patrick Morrisey — one of the recipients of the letter — confirmed they received a version of the letter from Sheedy’s official legislative email account.
In an email Wednesday, Ann Ali, deputy chief of staff and communications director for the state House of Delegates, said that House Speaker Roger Hanshaw, R-Clay, and House leadership were not aware of any hacking or impersonation situation Sheedy may have experienced. 
She said the House’s Legislative Automated Systems Division — similar to an information technology department — said Sheedy had not reached out for assistance. The department did a safety check for Sheedy’s accounts for suspicious activity and did not find anything problematic, she said.
Sheedy’s denial came after Democrats in the Legislature criticized the letter for its focus on politics and the election while Wheeling-area residents are still mucking out homes and trying to salvage belongings as they await federal aid.
Del. Shawn Fluharty, a Democratic lawmaker who represents Ohio County, expressed doubt that Sheedy’s account was hacked. 
“If he got hacked, then I’m an astronaut,” Fluharty said. “I think what happened was he intended to say something positive, and he actually said the quiet part out loud. He and many others are more concerned with maintaining their power and Republican seats in the Legislature.”
Second House Republican claims hacking behind controversial comments 
Sheedy, who was elected to the House in 2022, is the second state lawmaker recently to say that someone had hacked his social media account. 
It’s against the law to impersonate a law enforcement official or public official. 
Del. Ian T. Masters, R-Berkeley, told the Eastern Panhandle’s WRNR radio station earlier this month his Instagram account was used by someone else to write an antisemitic comment. Masters said he gave his phone to someone he had “known for a long while and cared about and was trying to help.” 
The comment was first reported on by West Virginia Watch. 
As of Wednesday afternoon, the letter remained posted on a Facebook account in a group called “Marshall County WV Republican Club.” A story containing the letter also remained on WTRF’s website, despite Sheedy saying he didn’t write it. 
When West Virginia Watch asked Sheedy if he had reached out to the station, he said no and that he does “not know where they got the story from.”
He also told West Virginia Watch, “From now on people will have to see me as usual when I attend; city council, county commission, senior citizen, VFD, and various other meetings which I engage in weekly.”
Sheedy did not respond to an email with further questions about his being hacked. 
Fluharty criticized Sheedy and other Republicans for voting down a Democrat budget amendment that would have provided $50 million to the state’s flood resiliency fund. 
“Now it’s coming back to bite them all in the ass,” he said. “And you know, not just limited to him, but our state failed to properly fund that previously. [Former Gov.] Jim Justice said we should put $100 million into it, and then Democrats attempted this past session to put $50 million dollars into it. It was shot down largely along party lines.”
Morrisey formally requested a federal disaster declaration for Marion and Ohio counties June 20, but the Trump administration has yet to grant the declaration. Disaster declarations allow affected areas assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, depending on the circumstances. 
The governor told reporters last week that he would continue to push federal officials for a declaration.

(Photo via Google Earth)A lawsuit between two health care providers is shedding new light on the scuttled sale of an eastern Iowa assisted living facility to a troubled company that runs substance-abuse treatment centers.
Shellsburg Associates, an Iowa company based in Benton County, is suing Landmark Recovery of Louisville, a company based in Kentucky, in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Iowa.
Shellsburg Associates was formed in the mid-1990s when it created Rock Ridge Residential & Assisted Living Care Center in the town of Shellsburg. State records indicate that at one time, Rock Ridge had 54 resident rooms, plus self-contained apartments, and offered on-site nursing care along with a doctor’s office and a helicopter pad that could be used to help transport residents to hospitals in Cedar Rapids, 19 miles to the east.
According to the lawsuit, Rock Ridge “suffered numerous financial setbacks” tied to the construction of competing residential care facilities that offered a continuum of care from independent living to full skilled-nursing care.
In addition, the lawsuit claims, the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected Rock Ridge and the industry, resulting in high fatality rates and a resulting decline in occupancy. Rock Ridge, the lawsuit claims, had “difficulty in retaining and paying its nursing and certified nursing assistant staff,” and the home’s occupancy dropped to only 12 residents in the facility with zero residents in the apartments.
Rock Ridge collected governmental financial assistance in the form of Paycheck Protection Program loans and other pandemic-related benefits, but the lawsuit claims “the funds were insufficient to maintain operations.” At one point, the lawsuit alleges, one of Shellsburg Associates’ shareholder owners was providing nursing services to residents without pay, while the corporation’s president was providing administrative, maintenance and janitorial services without pay.
Shellsburg Associates then fell behind in payments to its primary lender, Bank of the West, and considered filing for bankruptcy but decided instead to pursue a sale of the facility while “winding down the corporation,” the lawsuit alleges.
In October 2021, Shellsburg Associates allegedly entered into an agreement with Senior Care Realty to market Rock Ridge. In May 2022, Shellsburg Associates agreed to sell the property for $1.25 million to Landmark Recovery, which planned to establish a substance-abuse treatment program there.
The closing on the real estate transaction was scheduled for Oct. 19, 2022, with Landmark Recovery allegedly assuring Shellsburg Associates the sale would be completed as planned and asserting there were no financing or other issues that would delay the sale.
According to the lawsuit, the owners of Rock Ridge vacated the building, assisted the remaining residents in relocating to other facilities, and cleared the buildings of any remaining personal property equipment so that Landmark Recovery could immediately take possession of the property at the closing.
However, the lawsuit claims, three hours before the scheduled closing, Landmark Recovery notified Shellsburg Associates by email that the sale would not be completed. That decision, the lawsuit alleges, resulted in Shellsburg Associates’ inability to satisfy its obligations to Bank of the West, which proceeded to foreclose on the property. The real estate and care facility wound up being sold through a sheriff’s sale for an amount that the plaintiff says was “significantly lower” than what Landmark Recovery had agreed to pay.
When Shellsburg Associates attempted to collect money from Landmark Recovery for the damages it had incurred, the latter allegedly asserted that any such claims would have to be submitted to an arbitrator. Shellsburg Associates claims it then initiated an arbitration proceeding but Landmark Recovery refused to respond to the arbitration notices or to participate in the arbitration proceedings.
The lawsuit is seeking unspecified damages for fraudulent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation and breach of contract.
When asked about the lawsuit, representatives of Landmark Recovery directed the Iowa Capital Dispatch to the company’s corporate office and provided a phone number to a line that was disconnected.
Landmark Recovery has experienced a number of financial and regulatory problems in recent years.
In 2023, Indiana’s Division of Mental Health and Addiction shuttered three of the company’s Indiana facilities after three patients died in a single week at one of the company’s treatment centers. Company officials told Behavioral Health Business the closures led to a cashflow issue that resulted in two other Landmark Recovery facilities – one in Nevada, and one in Oklahoma – losing their lease.
In January 2025, former Landmark patients and staff told Indiana television station WTHR that severe understaffing and neglect had contributed to injuries and deaths at two of the company’s Indiana rehab centers.
In February 2025, police alleged a female patient at a Landmark treatment center in Louisville, Kentucky, was strangled by another patient who is now charged with murder.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Rock-Ridge-Assisted-Living.jpg,,,2025-07-16 17:11:49.800771

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)The state’s largest family planning provider is suing the Trump administration over the “big beautiful bill,” which excludes reproductive health care centers from accepting Medicaid.
That means about half of Maine Family Planning’s patients who rely on Medicaid won’t be able to use their health insurance to pay for services such as cancer screenings, annual checkups, primary care or birth control due to a provision in the newly passed law. 
That provision only applies to nonprofit healthcare centers that offer abortions, but existing federal law already bans Medicaid from covering abortions. Both Maine Family Planning and Planned Parenthood, the two organizations blocked from accepting Medicaid reimbursements, have now sued the federal government in separate lawsuits.
“Without intervention from the courts, we will be forced to stop providing life saving health care to thousands of Mainers,” said Olivia Pennington, director of advocacy and community engagement for Maine Family Planning in an interview. “At this point, the courts are our best hope.”
The MFP lawsuit came a week after a federal judge temporarily blocked the provision from applying to Planned Parenthood, making the organization once again able to accept Medicaid reimbursements so long as the block is in place. The MFP case names the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and its Administrator Dr. Mehmet Oz as defendants, and asks for emergency relief.
For now, MFP has already had to turn down some new primary care patients on Medicaid at some of its locations, Pennington said. The centers, many of which serve rural areas and healthcare deserts, are still largely seeing patients on Medicaid, although they are not billing those claims yet, in hopes that they will be able to seek federal reimbursements after the provision is blocked by the court, according to Pennington. 
But if the courts do not rule in favor of the family planning provider, the 18 MFP health centers across the state would stop seeing patients on Medicaid as soon as October 31, she said. That would mean a loss of about $1.9 million per year that the organization currently receives through Medicaid reimbursements. 
“If we can’t serve them anymore, our clinics are at risk,” Pennington said. 
The trickle effect could be devastating on hospitals in the area, Pennington said, because there are already parts of the state where the local hospital does not perform certain procedures. For example, some hospitals are sending all of their cervical cancer biopsy patients to a Maine Family Planning health center.
“These Medicaid cuts will have a much larger impact on the entire health care ecosystem of our state,” she said.
“If our clinics close, rural hospitals will continue to close, straining the rest of the system and leading to longer wait times to access care. Without Maine Family Planning, the infrastructure of our whole state network will crumble, and our patients will be left without help.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-16 20:49:27+00:00,CT Mirror,"Lamont urges CT residents to keep using health centers, despite Trump policy shift","Jenna Carlesso, Janhavi Munde and Keith M. Phaneuf",,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/16/ct-community-health-centers-trump-policy/,Lamont encouraged everyone to seek care at CT community health centers after Trump admin. banned funding from serving undocumented immigrants.,"Days after the Donald J. Trump administration announced that undocumented immigrants will no longer have access to certain federal benefits, including funding that supports care at community health centers, Gov. Ned Lamont encouraged all residents to continue seeking medical treatment at Connecticut’s health centers.
“This is what the federally qualified health centers do — we take care of you, no questions asked,” he said Wednesday morning at a state Capitol press conference. “I want everybody out there to know — please go take advantage of these centers. Make sure you take care of your health. It’s important for you, and it’s important for the overall community.”
Lamont said he worries about “some of the storm clouds out there” following the Trump administration’s policy change.
“We’re doing our best to keep you out of the emergency room, keep you out of more expensive care at the hospital and we’re taking care of people, no questions asked,” he said.
Federally qualified health centers across Connecticut are facing uncertainty about whether they can continue serving undocumented residents — a key patient base — following a recent move by the Trump administration to reverse a decades-old policy that gave people without permanent legal status access to certain federal benefits, including care at community health centers, behavioral health programs and Head Start.
State GOP lawmakers said the move appeared to be an attempt to avoid spending federal funds on undocumented citizens’ medical care.
“Per the administration, they have stated that these efforts are aimed at protecting taxpayer-funded benefits and vital resources for American citizens,” Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, said in a joint statement. “There does not seem to be any indication that someone who has illegal status cannot seek medical services at a federally qualified health center. The difference now is that they would have to pay for that service and the taxpayers would not be on the hook for their care.”
But leaders of the state’s federally qualified health centers say the money received through the federal Health Center Program — which is among the more than a dozen initiatives affected by the new policy — supports staffing, electronic medical records and overhead at community health centers. Uninsured patients currently pay according to an income-based sliding fee scale.
“The federal government could interpret it to say, if you’re using any federal money in your health center, you may not serve undocumented people,” said Deb Polon, chief strategy officer for the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut. “Many of the facilities have been built partially with federal funds, so maybe they’re going to say, ‘Your facility is essentially a federal facility, and you can’t serve undocumented people in that facility.’ There are so many different possible interpretations.”
For now, the FQHCs are continuing to serve everyone who shows up for care while they await further information from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Polun said.
Connecticut has 17 federally qualified health centers with more than 300 facilities. The centers serve about 440,000 people annually statewide, including more than 70,000 who are uninsured.
Of those, officials estimate that anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 patients per year are undocumented residents. The health centers don’t have a more precise number because employees do not inquire about patients’ immigration statuses, Polun said.
Legislative leaders on Wednesday criticized the Trump administration’s recent notification on community health centers.
“The latest pronouncement from the federal government this week about targeting any entity that provides services to undocumented students is a very grave potential hit,” Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney, D-New Haven, said. “Fair Haven [Community Health Care in New Haven], I know, is determined to find a way to continue to serve all of its patients and to not abandon anyone.
“What is happening is a health crisis around our country,” Looney said.
House Speaker Matthew Ritter, D-Hartford, called the Trump administration’s decision, “a really stupid policy.”
“When you cut primary care, people still need it. They just go to the emergency room to get it, and then you pay for it in your health care insurance or hospitals have more uncompensated care,” Ritter said. “It’s a very backward system. The notion that somehow the federal government is going to save all this money by denying people access and denying patients — whether they be documented or undocumented, the people you care for — they’re just going to find a way to get other care or put it off until it’s more expensive.”
Without access to primary care at community health centers, Polun has said, more people will put off treatment and end up in hospital emergency departments when medical care is badly needed.
“We’ve already had patients fearful of becoming detained or deported, so we’ve seen a change in some of the behaviors — more cancelations, more, ‘Can we switch this to telehealth instead of coming in?’ This is one more obstacle, one more barrier to them being able to access health care,” she said.
The new policy could mean having to ask for and verify patients’ immigration statuses at facilities and turn away people who receive coverage through the state’s HUSKY for immigrants program, which offers government-sponsored health benefits to certain undocumented residents, officials said. As of April, 15,600 kids in Connecticut were enrolled in the program.
Aside from undocumented immigrants, access to care could also be rolled back for children covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, refugees and individuals granted asylum under the new rule, health officials said.
On Wednesday, state leaders touted new investments they are making in federally qualified health centers.
The new budget that legislators enacted in early June calls for the state to invest at least an additional $5 million in the health centers this fiscal year. That grows to at least $12 million next year and $26.4 million by 2027-28.

That added state spending, in turn, would leverage extra federal Medicaid dollars for the industry. The total new investment would top $15 million this fiscal year, $36 million 12 months from now, and reach $80 million by 2027-28.
That $80 million infusion represents a nearly 23% increase above the roughly $350 million in state and federal Medicaid dollars Connecticut dedicated to health centers during the fiscal year that ended June 30.
State officials have expressed fears about maintaining this support for health centers given huge cuts in federal Medicaid and other assistance ordered earlier this month by Congress and Trump.
But Lamont and the General Assembly also have prepared to supplant some of those lost federal dollars with state funds, redirecting about $600 million from a program to reduce pension debt. Legislative leaders expect to call a special session in early fall to decide how much of those dollars and other state resources should be used to offset cutbacks in federal aid.
Despite the new state investments, lawmakers said they are bracing for more Trump administration efforts to restrict health care access.
“While this is a great day for celebration,” Looney said, “recent headlines from Washington indicate there are definitely dark days ahead.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/2023_0719_SR_Medicaid_048-scaled.jpeg,,,2025-07-16 17:11:49.800771

(Photo by Kayla Bartkowski/Getty Images)Attorney General Keith Ellison is joining a lawsuit with 19 other states to prevent the Trump administration from shutting down a FEMA grant program. More than a third of Minnesota’s counties were expected to receive funding from the program, called Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC), before it ended. 
BRIC provides funding for state and local jurisdictions to take preventative measures against disasters. This includes projects like floodwalls, tornado shelters and soil remediation projects. Coastal regions have received the most funding in recent years due to their vulnerability to disasters.
According to the complaint, 34 Minnesota counties planned to use the funds to update hazard mitigation plans that identify and address disaster risks. These plans are required when local governments seek to qualify for assistance after a disaster. 
“Preparing for natural disasters ahead of time doesn’t just save money and property, it saves lives,” Ellison said in a press release. “The Trump Administration’s decision to shut down a crucial disaster preparedness program is foolish, cruel, and unlawful. 
The Trump administration terminated BRIC on April 4, impacting disaster mitigation efforts across the country. 
“The BRIC program was yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters,” a FEMA spokesperson said in a statement that’s been since taken offline. 
BRIC was established after the passage of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 during the first Trump administration. Predecessors to the program arose from bipartisan efforts nearly 30 years ago that sought to increase disaster preparedness. A 2019 study found that every dollar the federal government spends on mitigation results in an estimated $6 of savings. 
Ellison’s lawsuit argues that the executive branch doesn’t have the power to terminate funds appropriated by Congress. It also states that the decision violates the Constitution’s appointment clause — the FEMA administrator who cut the program, Cameron Hamilton, wasn’t appointed by Trump or confirmed by the Senate. 
This case marks the 29th lawsuit Ellison has filed against the Trump administration, according to Ellison’s office. Many of the cases argue Trump has acted unconstitutionally by usurping Congress’ power of the purse. Recent lawsuits have involved cuts to Department of Education funding and ICE’s access to personal data.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/GettyImages-2215283635-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 17:11:49.800771

(Photos by Robin Opsahl/Iowa Capital Dispatch; photo illustration via Canva)Several of Iowa’s congressional races are expected to be competitive in 2026 — but incumbent Republicans kept their fundraising leads in most races, according to the latest Federal Election Commission reports.
U.S. Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Zach Nunn, Republicans representing Iowa’s 1st and 3rd districts respectively, are top targets for Democrats aiming to flip the U.S. House in the upcoming election. But FEC filings covering the money spent and raised by candidates from April 1 through June 30 found Miller-Meeks pulled ahead of her potential Democratic challengers — and ahead of fellow Iowa Republicans in fundraising for the second quarter, raising $1.3 million.
Miller-Meeks ended the period with more than $2.05 million cash on hand. In a statement on the fundraising totals, the GOP representative said she was “proud that so many Iowans are stepping up to support our America First fight” by supporting her reelection campaign while Democrats have highlighted her seat as a potential swing district in 2026.

The Iowa Republican won reelection in 2024 by less than 800 votes in her race against Democrat Christina Bohannan, who is running again in 2026.
“In 2024, Democrats outspent me by millions and still lost, Miller-Meeks said. “That’s because Iowans know I’m fighting for them, not for D.C. elites. We’re building the strongest campaign this district has ever seen, and with over $2 million in the bank, we’ll have the resources to fight back, tell the truth, and keep Iowa red.”
Bohannan raised roughly $812,000 in the same period, having raised nearly $927,000 total this election cycle. She thanked her supporters in a news release for supporting her “grassroots campaign” against Miller-Meeks.
“Mariannette Miller-Meeks is beholden to Washington special interests: big drug companies, big oil companies, and big insurance companies,” Bohannan said. “She takes their money–over $4 million from the special interests–and votes their way. Our support comes from hardworking Iowans because they know I’ll fight for them and always put Iowa first.”
There are three Democrats competing to become the 1st District Democratic nominee — Travis Terrell, a University of Iowa Health Care employee, and Bob Krause, a former state lawmaker, did not file FEC reports as of Wednesday, and Taylor Wettach, a former attorney, entered the race after the second quarter reporting period.
David Pautsch, a Republican running in the primary against Miller-Meeks, raised $9,250 in the reporting period.
In Iowa’s 3rd Congressional District, Nunn raised more than $803,352 through his campaign committee. Nunn is ending the quarter with nearly $1.3 million in cash reserves. The incumbent 3rd District representative also reported raising an additional $320,000 through his campaign joint fundraising committee and $15,000 through his leadership Political Action Committee, ending the second quarter with more than $1.1 million total raised.
“I’m deeply grateful to everyone who rallied behind our campaign and chipped in their hard-earned dollars to build upon our mission to keep Iowa’s voice strong in Washington and deliver real results,” Nunn said in a statement. “Together, we’re standing up for lower taxes, safer communities, and a more prosperous future for every Iowa family. I’m ready to keep fighting for commonsense, bipartisan solutions and deliver for Iowa.”
Nunn has pulled ahead of fundraising compared to his Democratic challengers, with state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines, reporting raising $520,800 and Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst at $251,045 in the same period.
Trone Garriott had celebrated her fundraising haul in a message earlier in July, saying in a news release that the more than $520,000 raised since her campaign launch in May is the most money raised by a Democratic challenger in the 3rd District during their first quarter in the race.
“I’m deeply grateful for the support pouring in from across IA-03,” Trone Garriott said in a statement. “I’ve spent my career bringing people together — across faiths, across parties, and across communities — to deliver real results for Iowa families. As a mom, a minister, and a state senator, I know how to listen and how to lead. Iowans are ready for leaders who care more about solving problems than scoring points, and that’s exactly what this campaign is all about.”
While no Democrats had yet entered the race against U.S. Rep. Ashley Hinson before the reporting period ended, the 2nd District Republican raised $853,757 in the most recent FEC reporting period, and ended the period with more than $2.8 million cash on hand. Democrat Kevin Techau, former Iowa commissioner of public safety, was running for the seat but suspended his campaign in June because of a lack of funding. He raised $142,340 in the second quarter, according to FEC reports.
On Tuesday, Democrat Kathy Dolter, former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College, entered the race to take on Hinson. Iowa Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, also said she is considering running for the seat.
U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, in Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, a longtime conservative stronghold, raised less money than the other GOP incumbents in Iowa at just less than $290,000. However, Feenstra may not be running a reelection campaign for the U.S. House — he has an “exploratory” committee launched for Iowa governor, announced after Gov. Kim Reynolds said she will not seek reelection in 2026.
Other Republicans have entered the race to fill Feenstra’s position, including Iowa House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl and farmer Kyle Larsen, who entered the race after the FEC reporting period and Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan, who had not submitted an FEC report as of Wednesday.
Democrats Ashley WolfTornabane and Stephanie Steiner also announced their campaign after the second quarter reporting period ended. Democrat Ryan Melton, who ran unsuccessfully against Feenstra in 2022 and 2024, had announced a campaign for the 4th District earlier in the year but suspended his campaign in June. He had raised $13,525 in the second quarter period, according to FEC reports.
Ernst pulls ahead of competitors in fundraising
U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, Iowa’s incumbent Republican junior senator, also outraised both her Republican and Democratic competitors in the second quarter — despite questions remaining about whether she will run for another term.
Ernst has not formally announced a run for reelection. She has hired a campaign manager and announced she will hold her annual “Roast and Ride” fundraiser in October, but has faced significant criticism in recent months over her statement, “well, we all are going to die,” when responding at a town hall to a person criticizing Medicaid cuts. Some Republicans have also criticized Ernst for her pushback on Trump nominee Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, though she ultimately voted to confirm him to the position.
Though Ernst has not officially stated whether she plans to run for reelection in 2026, Politico reported that some in Washington, D.C. are concerned that she will retire after her current term. Senate Majority Leader John Thune told reporter that he is “doing everything I can to encourage her to run for reelection.”
In the most recent FEC reports, Ernst raised nearly $723,000 in the second quarter. This was behind the $1.1 million she raised during the first reporting period of 2025, from Jan. 1 and March 31, and less than she raised during the second quarter during her 2020 reelection campaign of $1.1 million.
Some of the Democrats aiming to challenge Ernst raised nearly as much as her during the most recent reporting period. Leading the pack is Democrat Nathan Sage, the executive director of Knoxville Chamber of Commerce who announced his campaign in April. He raised roughly $709,000 from April 1 through June 30. He thanked supporters in a social media post for the support.
“That number is mind-boggling,” Sage wrote. “But it proves that this is a people-powered movement, and we’re just getting started.”
State Sen. Zach Wahls, D-Coralville, reported raising more than $656,000 since he announced his campaign in June. Andy Suchorski, an advisor for Wahls’ campaign, highlighted in a memo to supporters that Wahls’ fundraising “outpaces every single one of his opponents,” highlighting that he raised $400,000 in the first 24 hours after launching his campaign.
State Rep. J.D. Scholten, D-Sioux City, has raised over $175,000 in the reporting period. Scholten, who also launched his campaign in June, thanked supporters in a statement and pledged “to be the candidate that leaves no town or community behind as we fix our broken GoFundMe health care system, broken JBS food system, and Dollar General economy that is leaving working class Iowans behind.”
“I’m confident we will have the resources, and I know we have the hustle and Iowa work ethic to win this primary and beat Joni Ernst,” Scholten said. “We believe this election will come down to picking a candidate who can lead the party in all regions of the state and credibly mount the most formidable challenge to Sen. Ernst who has abandoned working class Americans. We believe substance, authenticity, and hard work will be the currency that matters most to Iowans.”
Jim Carlin, a Republican challenging Ernst from the right, reported raising nearly $86,000. Libertarian Thomas Laehn raised $2,684 in the same period.

As of Tuesday, seven people have been diagnosed with measles in Utah County, and three people are in the Southwest Utah Public Health District, according to the Utah Department of Health. 
All of the people who have been infected are unvaccinated, state health officials said in a news release issued Wednesday. 
Measles reaches highest level in 33 years, now in 39 states

The latest case, confirmed Monday, was a person in the Southwest Utah Pubic Health District. State officials said the person “reported self-isolating when they first became ill and is now out of the infectious period.” 
Two others were confirmed July 1 in Utah County. Earlier, on June 27, two others were confirmed in that same county. On June 26, five cases were confirmed, three in Utah County and two in the southwest corner of the state. 
Measles early symptoms show up seven to 14 days after exposure and include fever higher than 102.2 degrees Fahrenheit and a cough, runny nose or red eyes. A rash could appear four days after the fever starts. Health officials recommend that people experiencing these symptoms stay away from others and call health care providers before making a visit to avoid spreading the virus. 
State health officials are urging everyone to ensure they’re protected against measles with the  measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, which is 97% effective against measles after two doses.

Delaware transit officials are bracing for major service disruptions as SEPTA, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, faces a $213 million funding shortfall that could gut commuter rail service between Philadelphia and northern Delaware.
At a July 1 informational webinar hosted by DART (Delaware Transit Corporation), state planners outlined proposed SEPTA service reductions and DART’s potential response—including a new bus bridge to Philadelphia—as they await action from Pennsylvania lawmakers.
Deep cuts coming in two phases
SEPTA’s proposed service cuts will roll out in two phases. The first phase, effective August 2025, includes reduced frequency across all Regional Rail lines, cutting service up to 20%, and specific reductions on the Wilmington/Newark line.
“The midday service would be reduced from hourly to operating every two hours, and there would be some peak and evening service to be eliminated. And one weekend trip would be eliminated,” said DART Deputy Chief Customer Experience Officer Kathy Smith. 
Riders would also face a 21.5% fare increase.
Phase Two, effective January 2026, is even more severe. 
“This would eliminate all service on the Wilmington/Newark rail line. So there would be no rail commuter service within Delaware,” Smith said.
According to SEPTA’s official methodology report, the second phase would eliminate five entire Regional Rail lines—including Wilmington/Newark, Chestnut Hill West, Cynwyd, Paoli/Thorndale, and Trenton—and close 63 stations, representing 44% of SEPTA’s regional rail mileage. All remaining rail and Metro service would end after 9 p.m.
RELATED STORY: Recent SEPTA cuts would shut down Wilmington/Newark line amid massive budget crisis
DART’s contingency: A bus bridge
To mitigate the impact on Delaware commuters, DART is developing a direct peak-hour bus service to Philadelphia from Newark, Wilmington, and Claymont stations.
“There would be a direct commute from the Newark station to 30th Street Station in downtown Philadelphia,” said DART Senior Planner David Dooley.
 Fairplay Station is not currently included in the plan.
While exact timing is still in development, Smith said the service would generally mirror SEPTA’s peak train times: “It would be within the general time range.”
To inform the plan, DART will soon conduct a four-question survey at the three rail stations. 
“We highly encourage you and your employees to take the survey,” Smith said, noting that ambassadors will be on-site during morning and evening rush hours.
Commuter reliance on SEPTA rail
SEPTA rail remains vital for many Delaware workers. A recent one-day sample showed that about 78% of riders travel from Delaware to Pennsylvania, and 22% reverse-commute into the state.
The busiest northbound Claymont train, departing at 7:09 a.m., carries 118 riders, while the 5:23 p.m. southbound return train brings back 102.
Despite recovering from pandemic-era lows, SEPTA ridership remains below 2019 levels. 
“We still have not made it back to 2019,” Smith said. 
Rail alternatives limited
While some asked whether DART could contract with another rail operator, officials explained it’s not feasible.
“Delaware does not have a rail division, so we don’t have conductors or engineers to run the actual trains,” Dooley said. “It’s much more complicated than running the bus service.”
Budget stalemate in Harrisburg threatens transit lifeline
As of mid-July, Pennsylvania remains more than two weeks past its June 30 budget deadline, and the funding outlook for SEPTA remains uncertain. While the Democratic-controlled House passed a $50.6 billion budget on July 14 (including transit funding), it did so without agreement from the Republican-led Senate. 
This partisan divide means SEPTA still has no confirmed state support to close its $213 million budget gap. In response, the agency is moving forward with its “doomsday” budget: service reductions begin August 24, with even deeper cuts—including the elimination of all Delaware commuter rail service—slated for January 1, 2026.
Despite Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro’s efforts to broker a deal, there is currently no timeline for Senate action, leaving the fate of SEPTA—and thousands of regional commuters—in limbo.
In the meantime, DART is preparing to roll out contingency plans such as a bus bridge to Philadelphia and conducting rider surveys at Newark, Wilmington, and Claymont stations to better understand community needs.
“Everything that we are considering will not be happening until January of 2026,” Shields said, “either in the form of a bus bridge or maybe some type of hybrid bus rail service.”
What’s Next?
DART encourages public participation in shaping future service. Public hearings on broader service changes will be held the week of September 15.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/27866968144_681936e3d9_c-1.jpg,,,2025-07-16 17:11:49.800771

Kleine, a former Democrat who switched to the GOP in 2020, had told local legal and political audiences in recent months of his intention to run again.
“My mission has never changed – do what is right,” Kleine said in a statement from his campaign. “And make Douglas County a better and safer place.”
Kleine is a former top prosecutor with the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office and the Douglas County Attorney’s Office and a private attorney.
Kleine’s critics have questioned his willingness to defend some law enforcement actions and his decisions not to prosecute some officers and people.
He has enjoyed the support of local and statewide law enforcement unions. Officers have argued he helps them get dangerous people off the streets.
No Democrats have yet announced bids in the partisan county race.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-16 20:28:31+00:00,CT Mirror,CT aims to get to front of the line in Prospect bankruptcy case,Dave Altimari,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/16/ct-filing-prospect-medical-bankruptcy-case/,A filing by the attorney general’s office is designed to help CT get the $67M in health provider taxes it claims Prospect owes the state.,"The attorney general’s office Wednesday filed a lengthy court brief in the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings involving Prospect Medical Holdings, detailing all of the ways Connecticut has been harmed by the California company’s ownership of three hospitals here.
Attorney General William Tong’s office filed the “proof of claim” in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas, where the bankruptcy claim is pending.
Prospect Medical Holdings filed for bankruptcy earlier this year. The company owns three hospitals in Connecticut: Manchester Hospital, Rockville General Hospital and Waterbury Hospital.
The state of Connecticut is listed as one of the top 30 creditors in the bankruptcy filing. The state claims Prospect owes it more than $67 million in health provider taxes, also known as hospital user fees, which hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers must pay to the state every year based on their revenues. 
The filing on Tuesday aims to buttress the state’s claims as creditors jockey for position with the court. 
The attorney general’s filing includes a draft of a 41-page lawsuit, submitted as a court exhibit, that the office did not file before Prospect’s bankruptcy filing last January.
“We’re making sure that Connecticut’s claims are front and center in the bankruptcy case, by showing the court what we would have sued Prospect for if they hadn’t filed for bankruptcy,” the spokeswoman Elizabeth Benton said Wednesday.
Once Prospect filed for bankruptcy, all legal proceedings against the company were stayed, including a lawsuit by Yale New Haven Health over a failed deal for Yale to buy the three Connecticut hospitals. 
With the sale in limbo, the attorney general has expressed concerns about the levels of care in the three hospitals.
“The AG has said previously that the main priority has been ensuring patient care and safety and the transfer of the hospitals to responsible new owners. If at any point we believed litigation was the best way to achieve that, we would not have hesitated to file,” Benton said.
Tong’s filing alleges that “Prospect always knew it would strip-mine Connecticut’s hospitals, selling out their past and future for short-term profits.”
Prospect Medical declined to comment on the attorney general’s filing.
The court filing claims that the hospitals were unprepared for a cyberattack in 2023 that rattled operations; that Prospect sold the land the three hospitals are located on for short-term gain that benefitted Prospect’s management and shareholders while investing none of it in the Connecticut hospitals; and that it failed to pay many of its vendors millions of dollars.
“These Defendants took Connecticut’s community hospitals private and then sold the ground out from under them to fund massive investor payouts,” the filing claims. “They got rich deceiving the State’s enforcers; throttling its healthcare infrastructure; compromising the most private information of its residents; stiffing vendors; shortchanging the State through unpaid taxes; and endangering residents through compromising on vital medical care.”
Prospect Medical Holdings, which also owns facilities in California, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island, filed for Chapter 11 in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Northern Texas to “proceed on a strategic pathway to realign its organizational focus outside of California,” according to a company statement.
Prospect had not paid health provider taxes to the state dating back to March 2022, according to three liens filed by the Department of Revenue Services against Prospect Medical last January. Manchester-based Legacy ECHN Inc., an organization that controls a multimillion-dollar bequest to Manchester Memorial Hospital from a local philanthropist, is the only other organization from Connecticut listed in the filing’s top 30 creditors.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Manchester-Memorial-Hospital-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 17:11:49.800771

Kelly Armstrong testifies on highway infrastructure during a meeting of the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works in Washington, D.C., on July 16, 2025. (Screenshot from Senate webcast)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong highlighted the need for permitting reform and flexibility for states to administer federal transportation funding during a U.S. Senate committee hearing in Washington, D.C.
Armstrong provided a state’s perspective Wednesday on the Surface Transportation Reauthorization Act, which provides federal funding to states to maintain highways, roads and other transportation projects. The act was funded through the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act in 2021, and will expire Sept. 30, 2026.
He told federal lawmakers the roads in North Dakota are not only for the use of local residents but the entire nation as the state provides for the agriculture and energy demands of the country.
“The movement of people and goods from the coasts across North Dakota and other rural states benefits people and businesses at both ends,” Armstrong told members of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.
Armstrong, who testified on behalf of the National Governors Association, said federal grant funding is important, but permitting requirements can be cumbersome and cause delays, increasing project costs.
For example, Armstrong highlighted a $30 million federal grant the North Dakota Department of Transportation received for a rail underpass in Grand Forks. The grant was awarded in June 2023, but the department is still awaiting those dollars two years later, Armstrong said. This year the state Legislature approved $20 million in state funding for the project because of the cost increase associated with the two-year delay, Armstrong said.
“We would take less money from the federal government every single day, if we could get a shovel in the ground faster,” he said.
He added that each state has different needs and environmental concerns when it comes to infrastructure, which means states need more flexibility in administering federal funds.
The panel included Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego, who said the city recently had 31 straight days with temperatures over 110 degrees. Armstrong added that North Dakota has a shortened construction season with temperatures that can reach as low as 60 below zero.
Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., a member of the committee, said funding for the highway system is structured around a gas tax that provides funds to make infrastructure improvements, but electric and hybrid vehicles have created unequal participation in that system.
North Dakota House, Senate at odds over proposed gas tax increase

“The pay-to-use system is what our highway system is built on,” Cramer said. He added even combustion engines are using less gas today than years ago.
Armstrong cautioned federal lawmakers against using a miles-driven funding formula because it would disadvantage states like North Dakota and Wyoming that typically require drivers to log more miles based on the distances between population centers.
“If you can deploy the money faster and allow us to do things faster, that’s what I think is the easiest version for adequate funding, because we don’t need as much,” Armstrong said.
North Dakota lawmakers this year considered raising the state gas tax for the first time in 20 years, which supporters said was needed to keep up with the rising cost of road construction projects. The Legislature ultimately rejected increasing the tax. 
Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., ranking member on the committee, raised concerns about recent funds approved by Congress that were paused by President Donald Trump’s administration, such as dollars for education. He said any bipartisan bill requires trust that the funding will be implemented as Congress has directed.
“If we are going to have to continue to live through this selective refusal to release appropriated, obligated funds … that’s a huge deterrent to getting this done,” Whitehouse said. 
Armstrong, a Republican and former member of Congress, also attended a White House bill signing Wednesday afternoon. President Trump signed the HALT Fentanyl Act, which will list fentanyl-related substances as Schedule 1 drugs, such as heroin. Armstrong was a co-sponsor of a similar bill that was introduced in Congress in 2022.

Tanya Storer stand beside Gov. Jim Pillen as he signs four bills on improving government efficiencies. (Erin Bamer/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Gov. Jim Pillen ceremonially signed four bills Wednesday that he said would increase government efficiencies, previewing his intent to tighten Nebraska’s belt even further. 
The bills Pillen highlighted help “clean out the closets,” as he put it, by either eliminating outdated mandates or increasing accountability measures. All are in the process of being implemented after Pillen signed them into law earlier this year. 
The governor, who has announced a run for reelection in 2026, said government efficiency has been a top priority for him, and he repeated his pledge Wednesday to “run government like a business.”
Pillen has asked state agencies to submit recommendations of how they would reduce general fund spending by 10% next year, as first reported by the Lincoln Journal Star. That equates to at least a $500 million cut across state government. 
The news comes after continued concerns about Nebraska’s economic stability, due partly to recent changes in federal spending. Passage of the federal budget reconciliation package has prompted worries about the possibility of future budget cuts in Nebraska due to the legislation’s adjustments to Medicaid. 
Nebraska ends fiscal year $86 million short on expected tax revenues

Tuesday, the Nebraska Department of Revenue also released the state’s general fund receipts for June, revealing that tax revenues fell $86 million short of predictions for the overall fiscal year. The revisions leave another projected deficit in the state’s current biennial budget, according to Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent, after lawmakers spent last session filling a separate budget hole. 
Pillen denied seeing any economic signals that led to him seeking the cuts. He said his cabinet members stand by his vision for shrinking government and noted that spending cuts have been a longtime goal for him. 
“For all of us in business, it’s a walk in the park,” Pillen said of cutting budgets. “We do it all the time. We do it every day. It’s a little bit revolutionary for government.”
Former Gov. Dave Heineman, in an interview with the Nebraska Examiner on Wednesday, said he could think of no reason for seeking such a steep cut without an economic downturn on the horizon. He said he’s seen some signs of a slowdown in Nebraska’s agricultural economy. 
It’s either that, or a response to the coming federal budget cuts, Heineman said.

A 10% budget cut is unprecedented, especially without any economic contributors, Heineman said. When he was governor during the Great Recession, he said he signed off on a budget that cut general fund spending roughly 4.8%. It held funding flat for K-12 and higher education. 
Pillen indicated that there are mistakes he has made as governor that he hopes to correct through the cuts. For example, he listed an initiative he led that sought to reduce the number of full-time employees working for Nebraska, which only led agencies to seek out more expensive contracted services instead. 
“If you ask for the wrong measurement, you go down the wrong path,” Pillen said. 
This isn’t the first time Pillen has asked state agencies to look for areas to cut. Heineman said he may be running out of room to cut without reducing services. He predicted that staffing cuts may be Pillen’s biggest opportunity to lower state spending. 
“Personnel is the key issue that drives most budgets,” Heineman said. 
Passed efficiency bills
On Wednesday, Pillen ceremoniously signed Legislative Bill 346, which was introduced by Speaker of the Legislature John Arch of La Vista at Pillen’s request. The law eliminates no less than 20 boards, commissions and other government groups and reassigns the duties of at least 16 more to other existing groups.

Arch said he enthusiastically agreed to introduce the bill for Pillen, arguing that the state should consistently review such groups to ensure they’re still needed. He said maintaining them without a proven value is a waste of taxpayer money. 
“So much in government is easy to start, much harder to stop,” Arch said. 
Another law Pillen touted was LB 376 from the Health and Human Services Committee. It will eliminate 28 required reports by the Nebraska Department of Health and Human Services, add sunset dates to two more and modernize another six, according to DHHS CEO Steve Corsi. 
Corsi said the 28 eliminated reports are “outdated,” and essentially waste staff time. Before the bill, Corsi claimed the department would send an average of one report to the Nebraska Legislature every other day, totaling over 1,800 pages per year. 
“I doubt that those reports were often getting read, or used,” Corsi said. 
Additionally, Corsi said the law removes a mandate that all Nebraska counties provide the department with office space. 
Pillen also signed LB 660, introduced by State Sen. Bob Andersen of Omaha, which the senator said will improve tracking of federal funding flowing into the state, and protect Nebraska’s infrastructure from foreign surveillance. 
The bill includes a provision first proposed by Sen. Tanya Storer of Whitman meant to improve the method for submitting a public comment or legal complaint on a proposed government rule or regulation.

(Photo courtesy of the American Wild Horse Campaign)President Donald Trump’s effort to eliminate longstanding protections preventing the slaughter of America’s wild horses hit a snag this week when the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations included language in an Interior Dept. funding bill that reaffirmed the protections.
Trump’s budget proposal to slash funding for the Bureau of Land Management’s Wild Horse and Burro program by 25% would have allowed the slaughter of some 64,000 federal protected wild horses in government holding facilities.
“The action by the House Appropriations Committee, in response to our June 11, 2025, letter, to again prohibit the slaughter of wild horses corrects an omission in the President’s Budget Request,” U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said in a statement to the Current.
Trump’s proposal “would have also allowed for the large-scale transfer of wild horses and burros to foreign countries such as Canada and Mexico, where horse slaughter facilities continue to operate,” the American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC) said in a news release.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The effort mirrored Trump’s 2017 budget, which initially called for a 30% cut to the program’s funding and the elimination of protections against slaughter. Congress restored the protections against killing the animals and augmented funding.
The House bill appropriates $144 million to the BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program.
The measure “reaffirms Congressional intent to prohibit slaughter and reflects the values of the American people,” Suzanne Roy, executive director of AWHC, said in a news release.
Legislation introduced by Titus last week calls for the BLM to employ humane roundup techniques.
“Wild horses need to be protected from slaughter but also from helicopter roundups that can injure and kill them,” Titus said. “What is needed now is action by Congress on my legislation to eliminate the use of helicopters in BLM wild horse roundups and require a report to explore the benefits of alternative methods for humanely gathering horses, such as employing traditional cowboys.”
In the last five years, the government has spent at least $36.7 million on roundups, according to Titus, including more than $6 million paid in one year to helicopter roundup contractors.
“Scientific research has shown that more humane and cost-effective alternatives, like fertility control, are equally effective in controlling equine populations,” Titus said in a news release. “The BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program, however, currently spends less than four percent of its budget on these methods.”

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Twenty-eight cities and counties including Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”

The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County.
Hennepin has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

Joni Ernst (R-Iowa) (left) and Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) (right) at a rally in Grand Rapids on Oct. 16, 2024. | Kyle DavidsonAs U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers fights off accusations of misleading potential voters on his fundraising efforts over the last quarter, the numbers show potential cracks in his campaign and could open the door for another challenger on the Republican side to jump in.
Rogers reported that he raised nearly $1.5 million, but those figures were brought in by two separate committees – one for his campaign and another from a joint fundraising committee, the Detroit News reported. 
Through his campaign over the past three month reporting period, Rogers raised nearly $745,000, while the joint fundraising committee, Team Rogers, raised approximately $780,000, Federal Election Commission filings show. That leaves him with about $1.1 million cash on hand at the close of the period.
Although Michigan media has kept a hawk’s eye on fundraising, other outlets, like the conservative Washington Examiner, also noted the discrepancy. The outlet initially reported him as having raised $1.5 million but later updated its piece to reflect that the $745,000 his campaign raised lagged behind each of his Democratic opponents in the race.
Still, Rogers’ campaign doubled down in a statement and said his actual fundraising total was the aforementioned $1.5 million.
“Chuck Schumer and his Democrat cronies are so scared of Mike Rogers that they’re to convince you that $745,170 and $778,615 don’t equal $1.523 million,” said campaign spokesperson Alyssa Brouillet in a statement. “The Left will do anything to district from the fact that Mike Rogers outraised their candidate, Haley Stevens. And reporters might be falling for their lies, but Michigan voters won’t.”
With Rogers as the Republicans’ semi-official anointed candidate with zero clear primary challengers, Joanna Rodriguez, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, also jumped in the fray on social media to defend Rogers’ fundraising claims.

Because they’re right.
Multiple campaign reporters clearly need a lesson in campaign finance & common sense.
What A CANDIDATE raises into a joint fundraising committee that benefits THE CANDIDATE & a committee that endorsed THE CANDIDATE was in fact raised by… THE CANDIDATE! https://t.co/SNq9l6TuMt

Meanwhile, the Democrats in the race were sailing ahead of Rogers in that regard. State Sen. Mallory McMorrow (D-Royal Oak) was the most successful of the lot over the past reporting period, raising $2.1 million, campaign finance filings show. She spent $1.3 million over the reporting period ending on June 30 and has $826,912 cash on hand.
That’s good news for McMorrow, who is up against U.S. Rep. Haley Stevens (D-Birmingham), former Michigan House Speaker Joe Tate (D-Detroit) and Abdul El-Sayed, the former Wayne County health director and a 2018 primary gubernatorial primary candidate.
McMorrow praised her campaign’s efforts, and claimed she did it “without a single dime of corporate PAC dollars.”

Holy crap. It’s official. Of those who have posted, we outraised every other candidate in the Michigan Senate field, Dem AND Republican. WE did that. We did it together, and without a single DIME of corporate PAC dollars. Thank you thank you thank you. pic.twitter.com/OrpuEeDy9u
— Mallory McMorrow (@MalloryMcMorrow) July 15, 2025

El-Sayed was a close second in the fundraising push, raising $1.8 million and having spent nearly $700,000 during the reporting period, leaving him with $1.1 million cash on hand.
Stevens is viewed by some as a frontrunner in the race, and that apparently includes Rogers’ campaign as she was mentioned specifically in statements issued Wednesday related to his fundraising.
Still, Stevens this period came in third behind McMorrow and El-Sayed. She reported raising $1.3 million, but Gongwer News Service, a Michigan-based political insider, reported that she also transferred $1.5 million from her U.S. House account, which is allowed under federal campaign finance rules. Stevens has $1.9 million cash on hand.
Tate was running well behind the other Democrats on the U.S. Senate side, raising just $192,771 and leaving him with just $70,212 in the bank.
Although McMorrow jumped for joy on social media, Chris Gustafson, communications director for the Republican Senate Leadership Fund, wrote on X that McMorrow’s cash on hand was less than Rogers’ and that her cash burn rate in the second quarter was 62%, spending more than $1.2 million largely on digital fundraising.
“There’s of course a time and place for digital prospecting, but the middle of a brutal primary election is usually not it,” Gustafson said. “Someone is definitely generating revenue right now, but it’s not McMorrow’s campaign.”

Important context: Despite raising $2.1m, New Jersey native Mallory McMorrow only has $827k in the bank, $1m less than Rogers and Stevens, and $300k less than Abdul.
Why? She had an astonishing 62% burn rate in Q2, spending over $1.2m, largely on digital fundraising. https://t.co/bIYbNYPtS4

Door now wider than ever for Huizenga to jump in
As the Democrats in the race focus on each other and as Rogers focuses on them, the window of opportunity was never better for an undeclared potential candidate who has been mulling over a decision on whether to challenge Rogers: Republican U.S. Rep. Bill Huizenga of Holland Township.
Huizenga has been rumored to have been staffing up and gearing for a Senate run but has yet to jump in. He did make a trip out to Mackinaw City as the keynote speaker at a Straits Area Lincoln Day event in June that revved up Michigan’s Republican faithful, but stopped short of announcing there.
Although his latest fundraising efforts reported for the most recent period were directed at his U.S. House campaign, he raised slightly more than Rogers with nearly $746,700, campaign finance records show. Huizenga also reportedly has more cash on hand than Rogers with $1.4 million to the declared candidate’s $1.1 million.
That money could easily be transferred to a U.S. Senate committee if he decides to jump in.
Huizenga’s campaign was noticeably silent as the attention was on Rogers’ lagging numbers.
Those watching the race, however, noted that the numbers speak for themselves on whether a Huizenga versus Rogers matchup could be competitive, and whether Huizenga had momentum to give the Democratic opponents some resistance.
Speaking to Michigan Advance on Wednesday, Republican political consultant Dennis Lennox said Rogers was clearly outraised when contextualizing a potential horse race between the two candidates, especially considering that it was apparent Rogers had fudged some of his numbers.
“It’s not cheating, it’s fair, but it’s not totally accurate,” Lennox said. “It’s pretty incredible that a congressman, who hasn’t announced that he’s running and has been pretty much the victim of political intimidation at the highest levels outside of the White House, outraised someone who all but has the endorsement of the Republican establishment.”
That said, Rogers was running a better campaign this cycle in its early throes than he had when he ran against current U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly), Lennox said.
“But, despite having basically all of the stars aligned in his favor, the only thing he’s missing is a Trump endorsement. He can’t raise the kind of money – which means he can’t generate the kind of actual enthusiasm that you need – to win a race,” Lennox said of Rogers. “Republicans who are backing Mike Rogers, and Republicans who somehow think Mike Rogers can win, should be pretty scared by the fundraising numbers coming out of the Democratic candidates.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/PA169132-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-16 16:19:48.281659

Josh Shapiro called out the agency for ending an all-purpose pre-disaster mitigation program named Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities.,"Chantal's floodwaters left significant damage to Camp Easter Rd. and N.C. 2 in Southern Pines, NC on July 8, 2025. (Photo courtesy of NCDOT)North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson joined a coalition of states in suing the Trump administration Wednesday for ending a Federal Emergency Management Agency program that was designed to help prepare for natural disasters.
Democratic attorneys general from 19 states and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro called out the agency for ending an all-purpose pre-disaster mitigation program named Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC.
FEMA has selected about 2,000 projects to receive roughly $4.5 billion in BRIC funding over the past four years, according to the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs accused FEMA of acting unlawfully and violating “core separation of powers principles” by shutting down BRIC, going against Congress’ “statutory direction that Defendants must prioritize mitigation and are specifically barred from substantially reducing FEMA’s mitigation functions.”
Specifically, the states identify Cameron Hamilton as responsible for terminating BRIC in April after Trump appointed him as the acting director of FEMA.
“Neither Mr. Hamilton nor his successor, David Richardson, were lawfully appointed to run FEMA, and they therefore lack the authority to shut down the BRIC program,” the complaint reads.
The lawsuit follows flooding in North Carolina and neighboring states from Tropical Storm Chantal, as well as storms killing more than 130 people in Texas and unprecedented flooding across other areas of the country.
A report originally published by Inside Climate News and republished Wednesday by NC Newsline revealed that Hillsborough, North Carolina — a town that received serious flooding from Chantal — was in line to receive millions of dollars in BRIC funding that would have helped it better withstand such a disaster before FEMA cancelled the project. All told, ICN reported that 40 North Carolina governments had been owed $121 million in BRIC funding before the cutoff.
“This was not FEMA’s money to cancel, this was Congress’ money. Congress not only approved the money, but they specifically told FEMA this is how they wanted them to spend the money,” Jackson told Spectrum News. “It was not FEMA’s authority to cancel these projects.”
Coastal communities have received the largest allocations of this funding over the past four years, according to the lawsuit. This includes states like California, Louisiana, Texas, New York, Florida, and North Carolina.
Other states filing the lawsuit along with North Carolina are Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Chantal-flooding-SouthernPines2-NCDOT-1024x701.jpg,,,2025-07-16 16:19:48.281659

A new report found travel time and costs for abortion care jumped for residents of states that ban abortions. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)Travel costs for abortions and delays in care have increased in the wake of state abortion bans, according to a new study published in the American Journal of Public Health.
Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco surveyed more than 800 people across 14 states that implemented bans on abortion after the U.S. Supreme Court’s June 2022 decision that dismantled the constitutional right to abortion.
“Our research shows that the Dobbs decision has increased the cost of abortion and slowed people down, but it hasn’t decreased their determination to get that care,” said Diana Greene Foster, a professor at UCSF and the lead author of the study.
The states covered by the study banned abortion during the research time frame, from June 2022 through June 2024: Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
For people from those states, travel time, overnight stays and travel costs associated with seeking an abortion increased after bans were in place, Greene and her colleagues at UCSF’s Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health program found.
GOP lawmakers push to charge women with homicide for seeking abortions

Travel time for residents from abortion-ban states increased from 2.8 hours to 11.3 hours, compared with abortion access before a ban, and travel costs increased from $179 to $372. More than half of respondents said their abortion care required an overnight hotel stay, compared with 5% before an abortion ban.
About 8 in 10 people who contacted an abortion clinic or call center reported traveling to another state for an abortion, the UCSF researchers found. Just 3% reported continuing their pregnancy to birth.
Last year, 155,000 people traveled out of state for abortion care, according to a June report from the Guttmacher Institute, a research and policy organization focused on advancing reproductive rights.
Currently, 12 states have a total ban on abortion, while four more ban abortion after six weeks’ gestation, before many women know they are pregnant, according to the most recent Guttmacher data.
Republican lawmakers in some states have tried to clamp down on abortion travel in recent years. Idaho and Tennessee have both passed laws that make it a crime to help a pregnant minor travel to get a legal abortion without parental consent, while several other states have considered similar legislation. Most of Idaho’s law has been blocked by a judge, as has Tennessee’s.

However, attorneys for the State of Montana […]","The Cascade County Courthouse in Great Falls, Montana (Photo by Darrell Ehrlick of the Daily Montanan).In 2022, a Cascade County jury awarded a young woman and her guardian more than $16 million against the Montana Department of Public Health and Human Services for not properly investigating and halting abuse that will leave her dependent on constant care for the rest of her life.
However, attorneys for the State of Montana appealed that jury’s decision, arguing the trial court judge, Cascade County District Court Judge Elizabeth Best, had made several mistakes during the trial. The Montana Supreme Court ultimately agreed with state attorneys, vacated the jury’s decision and sent it back to the court for decision-making by a new jury.
On Monday night, a Cascade County jury reconsidered the case in light of the Supreme Court’s decision and found that the DPHHS was still responsible for Seraphina Wilson’s injuries, which jurors said should have reasonably been predicted after reports and medical evidence of child abuse. It awarded her $11.2 million.
“The jury’s verdict is an important measure of accountability for what happened to Sera,” said Raph Graybill, one of Wilson’s attorneys. “The verdict also recognizes the importance of properly investigating child abuse and protecting children when abuse has occurred.”
Graybill told the Daily Montanan Wilson’s condition requires around-the-clock care, and she was left blind with a severe traumatic brain injury because of the abuse. The jury’s award will go to help cover those future costs.
A spokeswoman for the DPHHS said it has no comment on the case when contacted Wednesday.
Court documents detail the abuse of Wilson, at the hands of her father’s girlfriend, Alicia J. Hocter, who is serving a 30-year-sentence in the Montana Women’s Prison for the injuries. Hocter picked up a 6-month old Wilson when she was crying, slammed her head against the side of the crib multiple times before throwing her back into a crib.
However, the documents also show that DPHHS had received several reports prior to the incident, including a doctor who examined the infant in the emergency department of Benefis hospital in Great Falls. The physician, according to court records, found multiple bruises on her belly that Wilson’s father could not explain. A caseworker with the DPHHS investigated the home where Hocter and he lived, noting that it just barely met minimal standards, and the case worker suggested they clean.
Court records also show that at least twice more DPHHS received concerned phone calls about a child crying for long periods of time, the smell of marijuana coming from the apartment, and her father, who left Wilson alone, unattended in her car seat, while he went to visit Hocter while she was giving birth at a hospital.
Attorneys for the State of Montana had argued that it could not have reasonably predicted the child abuse would happen, and therefore shouldn’t be held liable. But on Tuesday, the second jury concluded that the state was negligent in failing to protect Wilson and that that negligence resulted in the cause of injuries.
The jury’s $11.2 million award is based on several different categories:

$2.45 million for Wilson’s “impaired course of life”
$875,000 for pain and suffering.
$6 million for future attendant care
$650,000 for future medical costs
$1.1 million for loss of future earning capacity
$162,500 for past attendant care.

The trial lasted for a week, and Wilson was also represented by Larry Anderson of the Anderson Law Firm.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/IMG-3720-scaled-e1744406607973-1024x643.jpg,,,2025-07-16 16:19:48.281659

The man, whose name has been lost to time, was the victim of a lynching – one of several hundred Black people killed at the hands of white mobs in the Mississippi Delta in the first half of the 20th century.
Local Black sharecroppers were afraid to cut the man down. But Silas Kelly wasn’t. The wealthy Black landowner took the body to his home to prepare for burial. The idea for Delta Burial Corp. was born. 
Now 100 years later, the funeral home’s mission is the same: provide dignified burials for locals in the Mississippi Delta, regardless of status and income.
Without help from nearby banks, Kelly and his Black colleagues in business and farming pooled their money to form a company. To this day, it remains a business managed entirely by Black stockholders.
Black mourners who sought a standard burial previously had to visit white funeral homes that subjected them to subpar service and inflated costs.

In an oral history, Greenville native and funeral home director Beatrice Huddleston recounted how sharecropper neighbors were often forced to tear plywood from their shacks for a makeshift coffin.
With local wages in mind, Delta Burial offered services on a sliding scale or with small monthly premiums throughout the Jim Crow era, the AIDS epidemic, floods and wars. Its leaders have provided sanctuary for civil rights organizers, hosted burial society galas and organized countless celebrations of life.
The funeral home’s longtime mortician, Woodrow “Champ” Jackson, embalmed Emmett Till’s body at his previous job – and assisted in the transport of the teenager’s body to Chicago. Jackson mentored several morticians who have passed through the Marks funeral home’s screened door.
Today, much of Delta Burial’s clientele still comes from Quitman County, along with southern Tunica County, Coahoma County and Tallahatchie County. Through the business’ inclusion in the National Mortuary program, the funeral home prepares bodies from as far as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and even East Africa.
This month, Delta Burial Corp. celebrates its 100th year serving Mississippi Delta families. Manuel Killibrew, the corporation’s latest president, credits the firm’s longevity with “reaching out to the community” and “good service.”
A community undertaker
When his father fell ill, Killibrew assisted him on house calls to collect burial insurance. He grew accustomed to his father’s route and soon took it over. He came to appreciate the conversations in neighbors’ living rooms. Every month, he would bring his report and cash to what 55 years later would be his office.
After receiving a large insurance payout from a car accident, he bought his first two shares in the company. He later became general manager and president.
Some aspects of the business haven’t changed. He still makes house calls, visiting grieving families and discussing funeral packages. He still has to negotiate with pastors to keep their sermons and services short enough to make the reserved time at the cemetery.

While the same sales agents for casket companies and vaults still call Killibrew, they now all work for the same company. Many of his suppliers have consolidated, which means higher prices. Memphis, Tennessee, and the Mississippi towns of Canton and Batesville used to have their own casket factories.
Killibrew, who says integrity and fairness are guiding principles, welcomes regulations in the death care industry.
State law requires funeral home directors to show families the actual costs of caskets, vaults, embalming and other services and products. The directors must deposit 85% of money from prearranged funeral contracts into a trust. The money is only released to the funeral home after the service is completed.
At Delta Burial, families have been shown actual prices of products and services as long as Killibrew has led the company. 
He said customers often ask for credit so they can pay expenses over time.
“But we don’t turn anybody down,” Killibrew said. “Some bring money every month. Some don’t. But I know we are blessed. We were founded on a religious foundation.”
“You make more on one family and lose more on another. So you still hang on,” he added.
He said a majority of Delta Burial funerals cost $3,000 to $6,000, which is well below the state average of roughly $8,000. He said he has only sold a $10,000 funeral roughly four or five times in his career. 
Families are selecting cremation more than in the past for financial reasons. Even Mississippi, which has the lowest cremation rate in the country, saw a 31% increase in cremations from 2019 to 2023, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health.
In his garage, between two Mercedes-Benz hearses, Killibrew pointed to a 4-foot stack of wooden box slats. The most affordable option available for a traditional burial is for his team to assemble a wooden coffin on-site.
“But some still like the show,” he said.
Some families are willing to pay a couple hundred to a thousand extra for a horse-drawn carriage procession. Some opt to rent the Cadillac hearse, which he recently bought in Atlanta for $134,000.
The ancestors
Delta Burial leadership and staff played a discrete role in the civil rights movement. For many morticians who were already embedded in the community, activism was an extension of their service.
On Feb. 2, 1962, former Delta Burial President John Melchor was sentenced to six months in jail for organizing a boycott against white business owners. Two other nearby funeral home directors were sentenced, too. Melchor’s bond was set at $1,500, which would be roughly $16,000 today.
Melchor also hosted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at his home in Clarksdale. The two spoke on the telephone frequently and strategized on how to register Black voters in the Delta.
“Until they are stopped, our money, our tax money, will go to the White Citizens’ Council. To be free, you and I must pay and give,” Melchor wrote in a letter to Mississippi pastors and community organizers dated Feb. 14, 1961.

He was fundraising for legal challenges to school segregation cases and cases involving the imprisonment of civil rights activists.
Melchor’s wealth and business success were seen as a threat by his white peers. The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, a state agency that spied on civil rights activists, kept more than a dozen files on him.
Like other Delta funeral home directors, Melchor’s business suffered as a result of his activism. The Sovereignty Commission connived with local law enforcement to jail his embalmers for operating without a license. While it was standard to leave the license at a business and not in a hearse, law enforcement still fined Melchor and his peers for the misdemeanor when they weren’t at their mortuaries.
Ginise Clement, Melchor’s niece, remembers the family’s first home, which was connected to the morgue and funeral home. She could see from the window in the dining room the caskets lined up. The smell of formaldehyde and embalming fluid would waft through the side door.
She remembers the fear she felt visiting. When she was still a child, Melchor walked her into the morgue to confront her fear.
“You have to be afraid of the live people because those are the ones that can harm you,” Clement remembers John Melchor telling her.
“Sometimes, they would,” she added.
Clement remembers the frequent death threats the family would receive over the telephone. She remembers the strange cars that would follow the family home. She remembers the harassment Melchor’s wife, Ollie Mae, received from administrators at the school where she worked.
“These people were fierce,”  Clement said of her aunt and uncle. “I would’ve been scared to death.”
A good day’s work
On Friday evening, mourners departed the funeral home’s chapel for their trucks and cars. The day’s visitation drew to a close. Inside, bouquets of flowers hugged a black casket and colorful lights cast the room in shades of purple.
Shelton Leonard, a 65-year employee with Delta Burial, shut the lid on the casket and wheeled it into a storage room. In another room was the casket with a young woman. Two services were set for the next day.

“I go out of my way to provide service for people,” Shelton said. “I think that’s what it’s about: helping people.”
As the sun set on Marks, creating pink and orange streaks in the big Delta sky, a red pickup, an ATV, a golf cart and two more cars pulled up to a corner near the funeral home. Ulysses Hentz and his brother, Phillip, gathered with neighborhood friends. 
They shared tributes to Killibrew and Delta Burial. Killibrew was a teacher for 33 years in the county public schools. He has also represented them on the Quitman County Board of Supervisors for 42 years.
For residents of Marks and Quitman County, economic development has been slow. But Delta Burial has stood as a beacon of success.
Most jobs are out of the county. FedEx has three buses that transport locals to work at its warehouse in Memphis. Others work at the prison in Tutwiler or commute to the many businesses in Southaven. 
Crenshaw Rubber Factory, an oil meter, a jean manufacturing factory and a garment mill have all closed in recent decades, taking jobs and families with them. The police department has changed locations at least three times in the last 100 years. But Delta Burial has remained in the same location. 
“It’s the oldest business in the community. Black or white. It’s a pillar of the community,” said Ulysses Hentz, whose grandfather’s funeral was recently arranged by Delta Burial.

The funeral home’s longtime mortician, Woodrow “Champ” Jackson, embalmed Emmett Till’s body at his previous job – and assisted in the transport of the teenager’s body to Chicago. Jackson mentored several morticians who have passed through the Marks funeral home’s screened door.
Today, much of Delta Burial’s clientele still comes from Quitman County, along with southern Tunica County, Coahoma County and Tallahatchie County. Through the business’ inclusion in the National Mortuary program, the funeral home prepares bodies from as far as Los Angeles, Chicago, New York and even East Africa.
This month, Delta Burial Corp. celebrates its 100th year serving Mississippi Delta families. Manuel Killibrew, the corporation’s latest president, credits the firm’s longevity with “reaching out to the community” and “good service.”
A community undertaker
When his father fell ill, Killibrew assisted him on house calls to collect burial insurance. He grew accustomed to his father’s route and soon took it over. He came to appreciate the conversations in neighbors’ living rooms. Every month, he would bring his report and cash to what 55 years later would be his office.
After receiving a large insurance payout from a car accident, he bought his first two shares in the company. He later became general manager and president.
Some aspects of the business haven’t changed. He still makes house calls, visiting grieving families and discussing funeral packages. He still has to negotiate with pastors to keep their sermons and services short enough to make the reserved time at the cemetery.

While the same sales agents for casket companies and vaults still call Killibrew, they now all work for the same company. Many of his suppliers have consolidated, which means higher prices. Memphis, Tennessee, and the Mississippi towns of Canton and Batesville used to have their own casket factories.
Killibrew, who says integrity and fairness are guiding principles, welcomes regulations in the death care industry.
State law requires funeral home directors to show families the actual costs of caskets, vaults, embalming and other services and products. The directors must deposit 85% of money from prearranged funeral contracts into a trust. The money is only released to the funeral home after the service is completed.
At Delta Burial, families have been shown actual prices of products and services as long as Killibrew has led the company. 
He said customers often ask for credit so they can pay expenses over time.
“But we don’t turn anybody down,” Killibrew said. “Some bring money every month. Some don’t. But I know we are blessed. We were founded on a religious foundation.”
“You make more on one family and lose more on another. So you still hang on,” he added.
He said a majority of Delta Burial funerals cost $3,000 to $6,000, which is well below the state average of roughly $8,000. He said he has only sold a $10,000 funeral roughly four or five times in his career. 
Families are selecting cremation more than in the past for financial reasons. Even Mississippi, which has the lowest cremation rate in the country, saw a 31% increase in cremations from 2019 to 2023, according to the Mississippi State Department of Health.
In his garage, between two Mercedes-Benz hearses, Killibrew pointed to a 4-foot stack of wooden box slats. The most affordable option available for a traditional burial is for his team to assemble a wooden coffin on-site.
“But some still like the show,” he said.
Some families are willing to pay a couple hundred to a thousand extra for a horse-drawn carriage procession. Some opt to rent the Cadillac hearse, which he recently bought in Atlanta for $134,000.
The ancestors
Delta Burial leadership and staff played a discrete role in the civil rights movement. For many morticians who were already embedded in the community, activism was an extension of their service.
On Feb. 2, 1962, former Delta Burial President John Melchor was sentenced to six months in jail for organizing a boycott against white business owners. Two other nearby funeral home directors were sentenced, too. Melchor’s bond was set at $1,500, which would be roughly $16,000 today.
Melchor also hosted the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. at his home in Clarksdale. The two spoke on the telephone frequently and strategized on how to register Black voters in the Delta.
“Until they are stopped, our money, our tax money, will go to the White Citizens’ Council. To be free, you and I must pay and give,” Melchor wrote in a letter to Mississippi pastors and community organizers dated Feb. 14, 1961.

He was fundraising for legal challenges to school segregation cases and cases involving the imprisonment of civil rights activists.
Melchor’s wealth and business success were seen as a threat by his white peers. The Mississippi Sovereignty Commission, a state agency that spied on civil rights activists, kept more than a dozen files on him.
Like other Delta funeral home directors, Melchor’s business suffered as a result of his activism. The Sovereignty Commission connived with local law enforcement to jail his embalmers for operating without a license. While it was standard to leave the license at a business and not in a hearse, law enforcement still fined Melchor and his peers for the misdemeanor when they weren’t at their mortuaries.
Ginise Clement, Melchor’s niece, remembers the family’s first home, which was connected to the morgue and funeral home. She could see from the window in the dining room the caskets lined up. The smell of formaldehyde and embalming fluid would waft through the side door.
She remembers the fear she felt visiting. When she was still a child, Melchor walked her into the morgue to confront her fear.
“You have to be afraid of the live people because those are the ones that can harm you,” Clement remembers John Melchor telling her.
“Sometimes, they would,” she added.
Clement remembers the frequent death threats the family would receive over the telephone. She remembers the strange cars that would follow the family home. She remembers the harassment Melchor’s wife, Ollie Mae, received from administrators at the school where she worked.
“These people were fierce,”  Clement said of her aunt and uncle. “I would’ve been scared to death.”
A good day’s work
On Friday evening, mourners departed the funeral home’s chapel for their trucks and cars. The day’s visitation drew to a close. Inside, bouquets of flowers hugged a black casket and colorful lights cast the room in shades of purple.
Shelton Leonard, a 65-year employee with Delta Burial, shut the lid on the casket and wheeled it into a storage room. In another room was the casket with a young woman. Two services were set for the next day.

“I go out of my way to provide service for people,” Shelton said. “I think that’s what it’s about: helping people.”
As the sun set on Marks, creating pink and orange streaks in the big Delta sky, a red pickup, an ATV, a golf cart and two more cars pulled up to a corner near the funeral home. Ulysses Hentz and his brother, Phillip, gathered with neighborhood friends. 
They shared tributes to Killibrew and Delta Burial. Killibrew was a teacher for 33 years in the county public schools. He has also represented them on the Quitman County Board of Supervisors for 42 years.
For residents of Marks and Quitman County, economic development has been slow. But Delta Burial has stood as a beacon of success.
Most jobs are out of the county. FedEx has three buses that transport locals to work at its warehouse in Memphis. Others work at the prison in Tutwiler or commute to the many businesses in Southaven. 
Crenshaw Rubber Factory, an oil meter, a jean manufacturing factory and a garment mill have all closed in recent decades, taking jobs and families with them. The police department has changed locations at least three times in the last 100 years. But Delta Burial has remained in the same location. 
“It’s the oldest business in the community. Black or white. It’s a pillar of the community,” said Ulysses Hentz, whose grandfather’s funeral was recently arranged by Delta Burial.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – A man who faced execution nine times and had his conviction vacated by the U.S. Supreme Court is asking a judge to enforce what he says is an agreement between him and the state’s attorney general that could set him free immediately.
But while Oklahoma Attorney General Gentner Drummond’s office acknowledges that there were discussions about a plea deal with Richard Glossip, they said no formalized agreement was reached.
Glossip’s attorneys though said Drummond in 2023 agreed to let the then-death row inmate plead guilty to accessory after the fact and receive a 45-year sentence in connection with the 1997 killing of Oklahoma City motel owner Barry Van Treese, according to court documents filed Wednesday. 
With good time credits, Glossip would be eligible for immediate release, his legal team said.
In return, Glossip, who was twice convicted and sentenced to death for paying another man to kill his boss, would not seek damages from the state, the filing said.
The agreement is an enforceable lawful contract, the filing argues.
Glossip’s attorneys said the plea agreement was agreed upon before the U.S. Supreme Court decided to consider the case. In February, the nation’s highest court determined Glossip’s constitutional rights were violated because prosecutors withheld evidence that would have aided his defense.
The nation’s high court vacated the conviction, a move Drummond supported.
Last month, Drummond said Glossip would not face the death penalty, but would be re-prosecuted with non-capital murder charges. He was seeking a life sentence, Drummond said then.
Drummond’s office said in court filings Wednesday that it wasn’t until June 28, four months after the nation’s high court ruled, that Glossip’s lead attorney suggested there was a binding agreement. They said it was never executed.
A plea bargain is not binding on either party unless and until the court accepts it, the state argued.
“Contrary to defense counsel’s abrupt, new theory, the parties have never reached a plea agreement in this matter,” the state’s filing said. “Defense counsel premises the existence of a supposedly binding agreement on an email exchange between himself and Attorney General Drummond on April 1, 2023.” 
In addition, Drummond could not have lawfully approved a plea agreement without consulting the victim’s family, the state’s filing said.
The victim’s family has criticized Drummond for advocating for clemency and his handling of the case. Drummond said although he didn’t think Glossip was innocent, he didn’t get a fair trial.
The Oklahoma Pardon and Parole Board in 2023 declined to recommend clemency. Glossip is being held in the Oklahoma County jail after being transported from Oklahoma State Penitentiary, while awaiting a new trial.
The man who confessed to beating Van Treese to death, Justin Sneed, is serving life without the possibility of parole. Sneed has said Glossip paid him to kill Van Treese.

Connecticut ranks sixth in the nation for aerospace and defense jobs, employing over 113,000 people in 2023.
That’s more than states like Georgia and New York. Connecticut ranks even higher in economic impact: the state generated $63.8 billion in industry revenue — the fifth highest in the country — and contributed more than $25 billion to the U.S. economy through aerospace alone.
Connecticut brought in nearly $2 billion in state and local tax revenue from aerospace activity, ranking third nationwide, behind only California and Arizona.
So while larger states like Texas, Washington and California may lead in total employment, few states achieve as much economic return per job. With aerospace manufacturers Pratt & Whitney and Sikorsky headquartered in East Hartford and Stratford, respectively, Connecticut is positioned to remain a top state for the industry.

LINCOLN, Nebraska — Nebraska state leaders filed a lawsuit against Colorado on Wednesday seeking to have the U.S. Supreme Court assert the Cornhusker State’s century-old water rights to the South Platte River that crosses state lines.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, announcing the legal action at a news conference with Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and other state and local officials, said, “Every drop of water matters.”
Pillen and Hilgers accused Colorado officials of siphoning off more and more water every day, even as Nebraska had been “nice” with Colorado, which has seen increases in housing, agricultural and business development along the waterway.
“We’re here to put our gloves on,” Pillen said, to defend what he called a “multi-generation investment” afforded under the South Platte River Compact that took effect in 1926.

“We’re going to fight like heck. We’re going to get every drop of water,” Pillen continued Wednesday. “We’ve been losing to Colorado on this issue for too long. It’s time we win.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called Wednesday’s lawsuit “unfortunate” and said Pillen and Hilgers “put politics above farming communities and the regional agricultural economy.”
“The failure to look for reasonable solutions and to turn to litigation is both unfortunate and predictable given the misguided effort driving the proposed canal,” Weiser said in a statement.
 ‘They want everything’

Hilgers said his team had exercised all options in communications with Weiser’s office before filing the 55-page complaint before the U.S. Supreme Court.
The complaint accuses Colorado of violating the interstate compact between Colorado and Nebraska, which was ratified in the states in 1923 and enacted federally in 1926. Under the agreement, Nebraska is entitled to at least 120 cubic feet of water per second each day of the summer, during irrigation season.

Hilgers said it’s hard to say precisely how long more water than allowed has been taken and that it’s getting worse, an assertion Colorado officials denied in 2022. So far this summer, Hilgers said, Nebraska has gotten its mandated water flows about half the time, averaging 75 cubic feet per second of water daily.
Nebraska’s Western Irrigation District was also recently forced to shut off the majority of its surface water irrigation due to a lack of water from the South Platte River, despite the compact, according to the lawsuit.
Pillen said Colorado is storing more water for its “upstream economy,” which he said comes at the expense of Colorado and Nebraska farmers, with Nebraska’s western neighbors having “no interest in anything being fair and just.”
“They want absolutely everything, they’re even stealing the water from their own farmers, for crying out loud,” Pillen told reporters.
 ‘All-front war’

The interstate compact also allows Nebraska to construct the “Perkins County Canal,” a major water project through Keith County and into Colorado that would allow Nebraska to divert at least 500 cubic feet of water per second in the winter, during non-irrigation season.
Nebraska is also afforded “eminent domain” over some Colorado land to build the canal, meaning the state could seize private land if needed.

State lawmakers, to the tune of more than $600 million, have approved funding to build a canal up to 1,000 cubic feet of water per second to capture more water flow in above-average water years. Nebraska officials say newly captured water would flow statewide and is not just focused on western Nebraska.
According to the court filing, Nebraska officials in January tried to purchase land from landowners in Sedgwick County, Colorado, at 115% of fair market value, deals that ultimately fell through. Nebraska pledged to take land “only if the parties failed to reach amicable terms.”
Hilgers said the situation escalated to an “all-front war” in the past year, with Hilgers and Pillen accusing Colorado officials of stepping up opposition, including through local Colorado landowners.
 Nebraska-Colorado ‘impasse’ reached

Hilgers said he and his team have had many conversations with their Colorado counterparts but are at an “impasse,” largely over the project’s scope, including canal size, location and Nebraska’s eminent domain rights, a provision Weiser has said he is ready to challenge Nebraska on.

The eminent domain provisions are believed to be one of a kind among any interstate compacts in the nation’s history, according to Hilgers.
“There is no alternative forum capable of fully resolving the claims Nebraska asserts against Colorado, which are of such seriousness and dignity as to justify the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction,” the complaint to the Supreme Court states.
Weiser said that if the Supreme Court does greenlight the “wasteful project,” it will force Colorado water users to build additional projects to lessen the impact of the canal. He encouraged “collaboration and collaboration, rather than litigation,” which could lead to a “durable and thoughtful solution” that increases regional resiliency and agricultural strength.
In 2022, a spokesperson for Colorado Gov. Jared Polis called the project a “canal to nowhere” and a “boondoggle.”
Polis on Wednesday called the lawsuit “meritless” and said the state had continued to meet with Nebraska in “good faith” despite its efforts to intimidate some Colorado landowners. He reasserted that his state has always complied with the South Platte River Compact.
“This escalation by Nebraska is needless, and Colorado will take all steps necessary to aggressively defend Colorado water users, landowners, and our rural economy,” Polis said in a statement.
Pillen, asked whether he had talked to Polis about the canal or lawsuit, said plainly: “No.”
“The bottom line: He and I do not agree one iota. And there’s no sense in further conversations,” Pillen said. “I’m not playing goober politics on this. We’re going to fight for Nebraska.”

Former Gov. Pete Ricketts, now a Republican U.S. senator for Nebraska, unearthed and reinvigorated the compact in 2022 with Hilgers, the then-speaker of the Legislature.
Hilgers said it was probably always “inevitable” that the U.S. Supreme Court would decide the issue. He acknowledged that while a minority of state senators have tried to claw back funding for the Perkins County Canal, he anticipated that future efforts to do so would continue to fail.
 ‘The future of Nebraska’

Jesse Bradley, director of the newly merged Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment as of July 1, said his team would continue to move forward with the project, parallel to the litigation, estimating that permitting and design would finish by 2028 for construction to begin.
The hope is that water will flow through the new canal no later than 2032.
“This is critical to the future of Nebraska,” Bradley said. “We will continue to push forward aggressively.”
Also joining Wednesday’s news conference were representatives of the Nebraska Public Power District, Central Platte Natural Resources District, Central Nebraska Power and Irrigation District, Twin Platte Natural Resources District, the Nebraska Western Irrigation District, the South Platte Natural Resources District and the state’s chief water officer, Matt Manning.
Hilgers estimated the state lawsuit could cost a couple of million dollars, including hiring outside experts or legal counsel, and take three to five years before the Supreme Court decides.
Pillen said Nebraska would not “save pennies” on the project and would have the “A Team 100% of the time” to win, “not a shadow of a doubt.”
Weiser estimated that “when the dust finally settles,” more than a billion dollars would be spent over a possible decade of litigation, and “no one in Nebraska or Colorado will be better off.”
Hilgers said he’s thankful the U.S. Supreme Court will decide the issue.
“We could maybe not get everything we want in front of the Supreme Court. But if we don’t file, we will lose. Period, full stop,” Hilgers said. “And what we will lose will so far outstrip the cost of this particular project that will really be a ‘shame on us’ moment if we don’t actually follow through.”

(Photo provided by Northeastern State University/via KOSU)A new effort to strengthen behavioral health services in rural Oklahoma is underway, thanks to a $2.3 million grant awarded to Northeastern State University’s School of Social Work by the Health Resources and Services Administration.
Over the course of four years, the grant will provide $25,000 living stipends for 60 Master of Social Work students during their final semester of school. Selected students will also gain access to evidence-based training and opportunities to attend professional conferences and workshops.
“We want them to enter the workforce with strong clinical skills, a trauma-informed approach, and a deep understanding of the unique needs of the population they serve,” said Eun-Jun Bang, NSU’s social work department chair and MSW program director.
Bang said he hopes the grant will encourage more Oklahoma students to pursue a social work education, ultimately strengthening the state’s number of behavioral health professionals, especially in rural and medically underserved areas.
Currently, the federal government designates all 77 of Oklahoma’s counties as having mental health professional shortages. Oklahoma also has a higher suicide rate than most other states, and it’s increasing faster than the national average. A study by the nonpartisan policy group Healthy Minds found more than half of the Oklahomans who needed mental health treatment in 2022 didn’t get it.
Three years ago, Bang and a team of three NSU professors partnered with local nonprofits and health care organizations to determine how the shortage impacted northeastern Oklahoma. They found unresolved trauma and substance abuse disorders were among the most pressing mental health needs in their community.
The outgrowth of that research was a two-year grant proposal process – that included early mornings and meetings over the holidays.
Despite their devotion to the cause, Professor Samuel Asante said he had all but lost hope they’d be picked, given the current uncertainty surrounding many federal grants and recent significant cuts in mental health funding across the country. He said he was surprised when Bang called him with news of the award, but is thrilled they are being given a chance to make a difference.
“Having the opportunity to train students so that they can go back and give back to the community to help their fellow citizens, to help, sometimes even family members who are dealing with the issues of trauma and substance use,” Asante said. “That, to me, is huge.”
To be eligible to receive a stipend and be part of NSU’s newly funded program, social work students will have to maintain a certain GPA, go through a separate application process and express interest in working with rural and Indigenous populations, where provider shortages are the most severe. Bang said preference will be given to those who demonstrate financial need.
Professor Allison Mason, who also helped apply for the grant, said the money students receive is designed intentionally to be a stipend, not a scholarship, so students can focus fully on professional development without the added stress of working multiple jobs or taking on debt.
“That allows them to have more freedom to and more support to go into these very rural communities where it’s been hard to place students,” Mason said. “Not because they don’t want to, but because they fiscally can’t afford to.”
Bang said NSU has received significant support from the local community, partnering with groups like Brockport Research Institute, Cherokee Nation Behavioral Health Services, Family and Children’s Services and Green Country Behavioral Health Services.
“We’re not only getting help from our community agencies, we also [will] provide support for those agencies,” he said.
Partnering staff will be able to attend some training at no or reduced cost. And hopefully, credentialed students will become valued members of the same continuum of care after graduation.
“This has truly been a labor of love for the four of us over the past two years,” Mason wrote in an email to the team. “We worked through holidays and early mornings to bring the Rural Recovery and Resilience Social Work Program to life, and we are both deeply grateful and humbled to have received funding for this important initiative.”

Free.,"Thousands of delayed federal transportation grants will get paid out, secretary pledges",Jacob Fischler,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/thousands-delayed-federal-transportation-grants-will-get-paid-out-secretary-pledges,,"WASHINGTON — U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy urged patience Wednesday from Democratic and Republican members of the U.S. House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee who asked about a backlog of approved grants the department has yet to pay out to state and local governments.Duffy, in his first appearance before the panel, said former President Joe Biden’s Transportation Department approved an unprecedented 3,200 grants between Election Day 2024 and President Donald Trump’s inauguration in January 2025. Duffy told the panel his department was working to send out the remaining 1,300 grants, but that the task would take time.He added that his hope was to complete the review by late summer or early fall.“We have been left 3,200 grants — that is a historic number — from the last administration,” he said in response to a question from ranking Democrat Rick Larsen of Washington. “I know you all want your grants, but I don't think everyone recognizes the workload that was left to us.”Duffy also promoted the inclusion in Republicans’ budget reconciliation law of $12.5 billion to overhaul the nation’s air traffic control system, calling it a “down payment” on a $31.5 billion need. He called on Congress to fund the remaining $19 billion.The air traffic control system has been targeted for reforms and technical upgrades for years. Renewed urgency on the issue came this year after a deadly crash near Washington Reagan National Airport in Northern Virginia during Duffy’s first full day on the job.'Leaving construction jobs on the table'Larsen pressed Duffy on the delayed grants, and several members of both parties also asked about the status of grants to projects in their districts.“I urge you to get on with the review of the remainder of these grants, because we're leaving construction jobs on the table without these grants going out the door,” Larsen said. “Holding up these grants stalls badly needed job training, construction investments, and we need to get them going on that.”Duffy said the department processed more grants in the first three months of the year than previous administrations had during the same period, but acknowledged that members of Congress and state transportation departments still wanted faster movement.“I know that's not enough for everybody,” he said. “Everyone wants their grants right now, and so we are working diligently to do that as quickly as possible.”But some Democrats also complained about seven grants that had been canceled outright. Six of the seven were in Democratic states, California Democrat John Garamendi said. The seventh was a grant to the University of New Orleans, he said.The projects appeared to be targeted because their titles included words related to diversity, equity and inclusion, Garamendi said.Duffy said those grants departed from what the department’s priorities should be, such as decreasing the 40,000 traffic deaths per year.“The racial stuff, as opposed to keeping people safe, that’s my drive,” Duffy said.Air traffic control modernizationDuffy noted many members of the panel did not vote for the reconciliation law that extended 2017 tax cuts while slashing spending on Medicaid and nutrition assistance programs. No Democrats voted for the law.But he said he thought everyone on the committee would have supported the $12.5 billion for air traffic control.Chairman Sam Graves, a Missouri Republican, praised the provision.“This funding will allow the administration to immediately get to work to replace critical telecommunications infrastructure and radar systems, invest in runway safety and airport surveillance projects and replace antiquated air traffic control facilities,” Graves said.That initial payment would be insufficient to the total need of the system, Duffy said.“We are going to need more money from the Congress than this $12.5 billion,” he said. “We will need more to do it. No offense to anybody, but the way Congress spends money, we're talking $31.5 billion to do the full project. And my hope is that we'll have an additional conversation about how we can do that. And I think time is of the essence.”Electric vehiclesDemocrats said they wanted to restore funding, provided in the bipartisan 2021 infrastructure law, for electric vehicle, or EV, chargers.Republicans said that money could be better spent on other priorities, such as dedicated parking spaces for truckers, an issue raised by Rep. Rick Crawford of Arkansas. Crawford, a former chair of the panel’s Highways and Transit Subcommittee, applauded the department’s recent move to redirect $275 million for truck parking.“Our nation was not and is still not at a point where rapid rollouts of charging infrastructure is a pressing issue,” Crawford said. “In contrast, our trucking industry is certainly not in a position where transitioning to electrification is a priority, but we do need parking.”Duffy told the panel that the Biden administration’s rules for building EV charging were part of the reason why relatively few electric vehicle chargers had been built. He told Wisconsin Republican Tony Wied and New Hampshire Democrat Chris Pappas that the previous administration’s requirements regarding social justice and climate requirements in contracts delayed construction.“There were so many rules about how the money could be spent, and it was polluted with ideas of the DEI and all the green work, which made it really challenging for states to build,” he said.Duffy, a former House member from Wisconsin, said he would carry out laws passed by Congress, including funding for EV charging, even though he disagreed with it. But he also said he supported Trump’s attempt to revoke funding.Pappas told Duffy his state was ready for the new guidelines.“We’re ready to put shovels in the ground in New Hampshire,” Pappas said.",,,,2025-07-16 16:19:48.281659

(Photo via Google Earth)If it seems like the local news you read and watch doesn’t cover the breadth of issues, and doesn’t cover them as well as they used to, you’re not imagining it.
A new study details a shocking decline in the number of journalists covering local news today, compared to 20 years ago.
In 2002, there were an average of 40 local journalists per 100,000 U.S. residents. In 2025, that number fell to 8.2 local journalists per 100,000 residents. That huge drop off means we aren’t getting the coverage of school boards, city councils and boards of supervisors that we used to.
The study is a collaboration between two organizations, Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News. Muck Rack is a company that connects public relations professionals with journalists. Rebuild Local News is a non-profit advocating for public policies to strengthen local news coverage around the country.
The study, which you can find here, has some stunning conclusions.

There are 1,000 counties in the United States, fully one-third of all counties, that don’t have one local journalist.
The decline doesn’t affect only rural areas. There are significant declines in some of America’s biggest cities, too. The study shows Iowa, although suffering a huge decline in numbers of journalists, is not nearly as bad as many other states.
Some of the least-covered areas are fast-growing counties adjacent to big metro areas. That’s true in Iowa, too, which I’ll show below.

We’ve been reading for years about layoffs in the news industry, but the study concludes “the data shows that the nation has a shortage of local journalists that is more severe and more widespread than previously thought.”
Some interesting Iowa numbers:



Statewide in 2002, there were 44 journalists per 100,000 residents. Today, that number is 14, less than one-third the number two decades ago. That won’t come as a surprise to anyone running a local newsroom, and it won’t come as a surprise to you, either. We simply don’t get the sustained coverage of local decision-makers like we used to. There are no longer “beat” reporters covering city hall, the school board and the board of supervisors. That results in citizens who aren’t as well-informed as they used to be, particularly when they go to vote. IF they go to vote.
Still, Iowa’s 14 journalists per 100,000 residents is enough to rank us 10th best out of the 50 states and the District of Columbia. It’s not good here, but it’s worse most other places.
The Iowa county with the most journalists for its population is Fayette County, up in northeast Iowa with the towns of West Union and Oelwein.
The Iowa county in last place with the fewest journalists per residents is Pocahontas County in north-central Iowa.
 Iowa’s largest county, Polk, which 20 years ago had 297 journalists per 100,000 residents, now has 35 per 100,000.
As I mentioned above, fast-growing counties near metro areas have some of the most deficient local news coverage. That’s true for Dallas County, one of the fastest growing counties in the country. It has only 2.9 local journalists per 100,000 residents. Des Moines-based reporters might get to Dallas County, but only for certain kinds of stories. As the study says about these counties in general, “Murders might get covered; school board meetings, don’t hold your breath.”

What’s it mean for you, for journalism, and for America?


What’s it all mean for you, the discerning news consumer? It means you’re not as informed as you used to be. You’re simply not getting the depth of coverage that you used to. It means you must work a little harder to find out what’s really going on in your community. Subscribe to the local paper if you can, watch the news, but also read digital news products like Iowa Capital Dispatch, Axios Des Moines and Substack columns that meet your needs.


For an old-school journalist like me, these numbers are depressing. It means there are fewer genuine content providers knocking on doors and digging into documents at city hall. There is way too much repackaging of news that comes from other sources – like those TV news stories I see in Des Moines all the time that come from Cedar Rapids or Sioux City. Those are time-fillers, but don’t really affect the lives of central Iowa viewers.
What’s it all mean for society? To fill the information vacuum, people are forced to get information from social media, where conspiracy theories thrive and misinformation abounds. In my view, this is a major reason why we have too many Americans voting for the truly incompetent people running our country right now. If Americans were better armed with facts, they wouldn’t buy the lies the Trump administration spews 24 hours a day.
Want to make America great again? We need to hire some real reporters and fix American journalism.

(Photo by Will Steinfeld/New Hampshire Bulletin)It’s not hard to see.
The thread running through much of the Republican political agenda is an overall low opinion of the American people. So low, in fact, that many of the GOP’s pursuits could accurately be described as misanthropic. 
That’s not how Republicans see it, mind you. What they see in themselves and their political leaders is a righteousness forever under threat from amorphous, morally corrupt forces. Many on the right truly believe that community teachers want nothing more than to manipulate young minds, even if that perception is fully at odds with their own public school experiences and observations. In defiance of the data, they are certain that immigrants are primarily to blame for American drug overdoses, violent crime, the housing shortage — take your pick. They just know (who needs evidence?) that crucial programs like Medicaid and SNAP are rife with “waste, fraud, and abuse.” Lifesaving vaccines are actually a hoax, they say, and doctors are the perps. The climate is not changing. Joe Biden did not win in 2020. Mass shooters are actors. Protesters are paid.
They know they are being lied to, and they’re not wrong. But they are wrong about the source and nature of the lies. The real truth is everywhere and unhidden — a political purloined letter that, in its stubborn invisibility, is undermining state and national well-being.
The question, then, is where to look so you might see.
On Tuesday, Gov. Kelly Ayotte signed 101 bills into law and vetoed seven. Many of the bills on which the governor took action aren’t particularly indicative of the divisive era in which we live. Every session includes measures that carry broad support and even when there’s a partisan split aren’t necessarily controversial, and this session was no exception. Other bills, though, fully represent the paranoia of these times and various dog-with-a-bone Republican fixations. One bill signed by Ayotte prohibits mandatory mask policies in schools, which is just the latest example of the GOP’s expedient abandonment of the “local control” they so claim to cherish. Another continues the chipping away at the foundation of public education, this time by moving the state toward a destructive embrace of open enrollment.
But Ayotte’s vetoes are in some ways more telling than the bills she signed. So large is the contingent of misanthropic New Hampshire Republicans that the governor, to her credit, had to put the kibosh on several of their darker pursuits. A book ban passed by House and Senate Republicans crossed a line for Ayotte, who rightfully said in her veto message that the state should not “engage in the role of addressing questions of literary value and appropriateness.” Another vetoed bill, an anti-trans measure that actually qualifies as pro-discrimination, was deemed by the governor to be “overly broad and impractical to enforce, potentially creating an exclusionary environment for some of our citizens.”
Ayotte’s veto messages also professed support for the efficacy of vaccines and the importance of the Youth Risk Behavior Survey to public health efforts.
In a season of very few wins for the left, Tuesday was a better day than most. But House Democrats are apparently so focused on the next election that the best they could muster in celebration was a statement reading, in part, “We’re grateful that today New Hampshire chose to protect the rights and dignity of our transgender neighbors.”
“New Hampshire” didn’t choose on Tuesday, the governor did. To pretend otherwise — and to take such great pains to avoid saying her name — makes Democrats look petty. The confrontation between left and right should be a battle of ideas about how to best serve the people of the state, but statements like the one released Tuesday reduce everything to the political. Voters see through that stuff, and they know it doesn’t serve them even a little bit. 
It was yet another unforced error for a party that should have more confidence that it sees rightly on a great number of issues.
One day, and I really believe this, Republican voters will start to question the solidity of two major pillars of their party’s platform. The first pillar is the collective nonsense of the policies and perceptions like those I mentioned above, which give shape to the false premises on which America’s current president and a great number of New Hampshire state senators and representatives were elected. McCarthyism has always had a way of devouring itself and that pattern should repeat — and hopefully not too late. Soon, enough people will recognize that vaccines are not the enemy, nor are immigrants, transgender people, teachers, scientists, and all of the other boogeymen Republicans persecute in order to tap into blooms of hatred, all in an effort to expand power and reach.
But the most muscular enemy of the American people is the second pillar of Republican policy: old-fashioned, exploitative greed.
If Democrats want to serve the people of New Hampshire and find electoral success at the same time, they should absolutely keep fighting against the darkness of that first pillar. That means standing up — unfailingly and boldly — for trans kids, migrants, and anyone else who the bullies choose to punch down on. At the same time, they must do what they can to make sure voters keep their eyes on that second pillar.
When I talk about the confrontation of ideas between right and left, that’s what I mean. What unites Ayotte, President Donald Trump, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson, New Hampshire House and Senate leaders, and countless “right-leaning” think tanks is a belief that making wealthy people and corporations wealthier will ultimately serve the lower and middle classes. We are promised a trickling down that has never, and will never, happen. I suspect plenty of working-class Republican voters could see that if they cared to look. You don’t have to read much analysis of New Hampshire’s tax decisions over the last decade or the president’s “big beautiful bill” to see who those policies were ultimately designed for. The electoral strength of  Republicans is centered on their ability to sell voters on a host of false causes for their very real struggles. Again, the truth is all out in the open if you care to look.
What is the greater impediment to relative prosperity for a working-class resident of New Hampshire? Immigrants with the wrong papers or the high cost of housing? 
What poses the greater threat to a young family of modest means? Is it a transgender girl playing high school soccer or a health care system that puts profits ahead of people?
And here’s one more: If tax-cutting policies that help make wealthy people wealthier will eventually bolster the lower and middle classes, why has the opposite been the case since the 1980s, when Republicans began that effort in earnest?
That Republicans — often in lockstep on the first pillar but always in lockstep on the second — keep winning elections is really pretty remarkable. When you think about it.",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/votingayottecolumn-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-16 15:07:23.821267

“Since taking office, one of my top priorities has been constituent services and this new initiative will allow consumers to make more informed decisions,” Morales said. “We’re putting the power of data in the hands of the people—free of charge.”
One of Morales’ duties is running the Auto Dealer Services Division.
A free vehicle history report can reveal hidden problems or accidents that might not be disclosed when purchasing a used car. It can also be used before selling a vehicle, to save potential buyers the hassle. 
Each report includes information such as a summary of vehicle ownership, collision or damage history, title flags, odometer rollbacks or discrepancies, repossession records, outstanding manufacture recalls, any service visits or known repairs and the AutoCheck Score. 
Buyers and sellers will be able to access up to five free vehicle history reports per year. Typically, Experian reports are priced between $29.99 and $59.99 each. 
Several other businesses approved by the National Motor Vehicle Information System provide vehicle condition and history information reports but typically also charge a cost. 
While individual Hoosiers won’t pay for the reports, they aren’t free to the state. The secretary’s of state office signed a contract with Experian at a rate of $2.38 per report. The company will bill the state $23,800 per month with a true up at the end of the 14-month term. That totals more than $332,000. The contract took effect in January and runs through February 2026.

(David Espejo/Stock photo via Getty Images)Agencies in at least 28 states and the District of Columbia have issued guidance on the use of artificial intelligence in K-12 schools.
More than half of the states have created school policies to define artificial intelligence, develop best practices for using AI systems and more, according to a report from AI for Education, an advocacy group that provides AI literacy training for educators.
Despite efforts by the Trump administration to loosen federal and state AI rules in hopes of boosting innovation, teachers and students need a lot of state-level guidance for navigating the fast-moving technology, said Amanda Bickerstaff, the CEO and co-founder of AI for Education.
“What most people think about when it comes to AI adoption in the schools is academic integrity,” she said. “One of the biggest concerns that we’ve seen — and one of the reasons why there’s been a push towards AI guidance, both at the district and state level — is to provide some safety guidelines around responsible use and to create opportunities for people to know what is appropriate.”
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

North Carolina, which last year became one of the first states to issue AI guidance for schools, set out to study and define generative artificial intelligence for potential uses in the classroom. The policy also includes resources for students and teachers interested in learning how to interact with AI models successfully.
In addition to classroom guidance, some states emphasize ethical considerations for certain AI models. Following Georgia’s initial framework in January, the state shared additional guidance in June outlining ethical principles educators should consider before adopting the technology.
This year, Maine, Missouri, Nevada and New Mexico also released guidelines for AI in schools.
In the absence of regulations at the federal level, states are filling a critical gap, said Maddy Dwyer, a policy analyst for the Equity in Civic Technology team at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit working to advance civil rights in the digital age.
While most state AI guidance for schools focuses on the potential benefits, risks and need for human oversight, Dwyer wrote in a recent blog post that many of the frameworks are missing out on critical AI topics, such as community engagement and deepfakes, or manipulated photos and videos.
“I think that states being able to fill the gap that is currently there is a critical piece to making sure that the use of AI is serving kids and their needs, and enhancing their educational experiences rather than detracting from them,” she said.

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Kansas has the nation’s most restrictive policies for accessing contraceptives, resulting in health disparities for low-income and uninsured residents, a new report found.
Population Reference Bureau, a research-based nonprofit that focuses on health and well-being, released its first scorecard on contraceptive policies on Wednesday. The report evaluates every state on nine policies that deal with affordability, access and the environment of care.
Kansas is one of 16 states that restrict access to contraceptives, the report found. Kansas was considered the worst because of a combination of restrictive policies and significant policy voids, said Cathryn Streifel, a senior program director at PRB.
“Broad access to contraception is essential to helping people live with more freedom, health and possibility,” Streifel said. “Contraceptive access supports reproductive autonomy, which is a fundamental human right. When people are able to plan their pregnancies, they are more likely to complete their education and participate in the workforce, which leads to economic stability for themselves and their families.”
Streifel said the deterioration of federal policies, including changes to Medicaid in the president’s “big, beautiful bill” that will strip health insurance from 17 million Americans, means state-level policies are more important than ever in shaping access to contraception.
The report faults Kansas for failing to expand Medicaid coverage to more low-income families and for excluding family planning services. The state also doesn’t require insurers to pay for prescription or over-the-counter contraception.
“This means that many individuals, particularly those who are low-income or uninsured, face significant financial barriers to accessing contraception, which can ultimately limit their ability to plan and control their reproductive health,” said Christine Power, a senior policy adviser at PRB.
Kansas policy doesn’t allow pharmacists to prescribe contraceptives. There is no extended supply of contraceptives in the state, and emergency rooms are not required to offer emergency contraceptives, which can be urgent after sexual assault.
  Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat, says barriers to contraceptives amount to “outright discrimination” against women and girls. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Additionally, Kansas law doesn’t require medically accurate curricula in sex education in public schools, and state law explicitly allows medical providers and pharmacists to refuse to provide contraceptive services based on religious or moral beliefs.
Minors in Kansas can consent to medical care only if they are deemed mature enough by a health care provider.
“This policy creates additional hurdles for young people seeking to make informed decisions about their reproductive health, potentially leading to delayed care, unintended pregnancies and negative long-term health outcomes,” Power said.
The report found 16 states, led by California and Washington, have policies that protect access to contraceptives. The other 18 states have mixed policies.
Rep. Susan Ruiz, a Shawnee Democrat who serves as the ranking minority member on the House Health and Human Services Committee, said the Legislature should be open to making changes in state policy that allow for easier access to contraception, and noted that it would lead to fewer residents seeking an abortion. But, she said, religious views were likely to get in the way.
The result, she said, is that the policies amount to “outright discrimination” against women and girls.
“Where is all of the outrage regarding the lack of sex education for men, for boys, and not holding them more responsible for their sexual health, their sexual activities?” Ruiz said. “It’s always the women. It’s always the girls. So women once again have the burden of being the ones always having to be responsible for sexual reproduction and having access to health resources.”
Robert Stiles, CEO of the Community Care Network of Kansas, said community health centers and clinics within the network are required to provide family planning services because they receive federal grants. He said those facilities could see more people depend on them for care because of federal cuts to Medicaid.
“We’re aware that that may place more burden on health centers or our member clinics that are serving everyone, even if they’re uninsured, regardless of the ability to pay for their care,” Stiles said.",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/P4100385-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-16 15:07:23.821267

(Courtesy photo, Upper Missouri Waterkeeper and Dan Armstrong)Rivers in southwestern Montana face dangerously high temperatures in summer months, spelling trouble for native trout populations, according to a report presented by Save Wild Trout and Upper Missouri Waterkeeper on Monday night in Helena.
The Jefferson River Basin Abiotic Monitoring 2023–2024 study, produced in part by Kyle Flynn, a scientist and engineer with KF2 Consulting, in partnership with Save Wild Trout, sought to determine the causes why fish have died at an alarming rate in the Jefferson River Basin. 
Flynn stressed there are likely multiple factors at play in regards to serious river health issues in the the Big Hole, Jefferson, Beaverhead and Ruby Rivers, but the collected data readings were generally bad.
“Not a great check for any of our rivers,” Flynn said during his presentation.
The study included more than 350 miles of thermal imaging flights via helicopter as well as long-term data collection from in the river itself. The study looked at temperature and oxygen saturation in the water, as well as acidity and streamflow.
Trout in the Jefferson River Basin begin to struggle when water temperatures rise to 70 degrees and an increase to 77 degrees, presenters noted, can kill fish within hours. Necrosis, or when body cells begin to die, has also been observed in some fish. 
The report also noted conditions were worse on the Jefferson River in 2024 than they were in 2023, and that that river is of major concern.
“The Jefferson River exhibited the most consistent and widespread exceedances of thermal thresholds of all the systems that were monitored, with many sites surpassing the 25°C (77°F) upper incipient lethal temperature for salmonids, and several sites having water temperature over 26.7°C (80°F) in 2024,” the report states.
However the report also noted that 2024 was unusually hot and dry, “representing near worst-case regulatory assumptions and conditions.”
  The Jefferson River Basin is pictured. (Graphic from Jefferson River Basin Abiotic Monitoring 2023–2024 study)
Even so, the report stated the “available data is of great utility as it provides a compelling argument that thermal and nutrient assimilative capacities in each river are exceeded.”
The study raised additional concerns about the oxygen content of water. Algae blooms have been observed in a number of western Montana rivers and they suck up oxygen, which aquatic plants, as well as fish, need. The report noted instances of oxygen levels in rivers getting extremely low, especially at night when plants most need it.
Flynn previously worked for the Montana Department of Environmental Quality and has taught at Carroll College.
“In the end, we want to take the data and evaluate against certain thresholds that might cause injury to fish or fish health,” Flynn said.
A main reason for the study is to direct protection efforts, stressed Save Wild Trout’s Brian Wheeler and Upper Missouri Waterkeeper executive director Guy Alsentzer during the presentation. 
“We can also target and prioritize where and how much we do our restoration efforts,” Alsentzer said. “That has to be done at that macro level, and we have to use the best available science to do it.”
Aerial thermal imaging flights conducted in mid-July of last year showed where the river was hot and where it was not. Combined with data collected from small sensors (occasionally camouflaged to ward off vandalism) the hope is to find areas of respite for aquatic life and protect those.
Data will hopefully be used to help shape policy, Wheeler and Alsentzer said, who also expressed some frustration with state agencies. There are data gaps, they said, and they’re not being filled by different agencies.
“The entire reason that this study is happening is because our state government has failed to do its job to monitor these rivers, and therefore what we are left with is something of a pickle,” Alsentzer said Monday night. “We are left with a dearth of data that now we’re trying to solve and plug those holes.”
Alsentzer also said the Department of Environmental Quality and the legislature were playing “dirty politics” over, “concentrations of nutrients that are allowable in Montana’s rivers,” saying they’re breaking federal law. Water quality laws have been a major point of discussion in the state legislature for the past several sessions.
The DEQ, in a statement, said “non-point source pollution” is leading cause of water quality issues in Montana.
“The Jefferson River Watershed is no different. Because this type of pollution lacks a single, identifiable source, it requires proactive management,” DEQ spokesperson Madison McGeffers wrote in an email. “The Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) tackles nonpoint source pollution through programs like its Nonpoint Source Program and partnerships with local watershed groups.”
Additionally, the DEQ statement said the agency is working with the Jefferson River Watershed Council on developing a Watershed Restoration Plan that will allow for increased federal funds through the Environmental Protection Agency.
DEQ has also been involved in the issue in other ways, McGeffers noted.
“Currently, DEQ has developed 91 Total Maximum Daily Loads (TMDLs) ‘pollution diets” for the Big Hole River and its tributaries, targeting pollutants like nutrients and sediment,” McGeffers wrote. “In 2009, DEQ identified riparian restoration as the most effective strategy for reducing sediment, temperature, and nutrient pollution in the upper Big Hole Valley.”
More work by the environmental groups going forward, including nutrient sampling, Flynn wrote in an email on Tuesday. Montana Fish Wildlife and Parks is also in the midst of its own fish mortality study in concert with Montana State.
In a comment on Tuesday, Montana FWP said they are studying the issue.
“These studies look to evaluate all the impacts in the respective systems on fish health from a disease standpoint, fish mortality and what influences it, fish recruitment and survivability to include what’s happening in the tributaries,” Greg Lemon, a division administrator within FWP wrote. “And to also gauge the angling efforts and what impacts that has on fish within the system.”
Additionally, Lemon wrote, FWP said they “welcome” input and feedback from those passionate about Montana’s rivers and that they want to work with a variety of groups.
“In a much broader sense, we believe that tackling issues affecting these rivers is best done in collaboration, including partners like Save Wild Trout and other partners, and that remains our focus,” Brown wrote.
Wheeler said the hope is the data is helpful to decision makers.
“We want to provide state agencies with data to build that historic record, and we want to give chemical context to the biological issues being faced by the fisheries in the Jefferson Basin right now,” Wheeler said. “And we also want to promote accountability and proper redemptive action when we’re not meeting those thresholds to protect these beneficial uses.”

Dear Reader,
At VTDigger, we believe the future of our state depends on more than public service journalism — it also requires investing in the next generation of news readers. That’s why your donation to VTDigger will do double duty today: supporting independent journalism and delivering a new children’s book to a Vermont child.

Donate & send a book

This week, we’re partnering with the Children’s Literacy Foundation (CLiF), a Vermont-based nonprofit that has brought books, author visits and interactive literacy programs to more than 350,000 children in local communities with the fewest resources. Often a book from CLiF is the first new book a child has ever owned.
Every donation we receive by Saturday will send a book directly to a Vermont child through CLiF. Our goal is to send 350 books from 350 community-minded VTDigger readers.
Reading is the foundation of community participation and civic engagement. Every child deserves access to stories, facts and ideas that expand their world. But in many Vermont homes, new children’s books are a luxury. Your gift today helps close that gap.
We’re so grateful to the 76 readers who have already stepped up and we only have a few days to inspire 274 more donors to help us reach our goal. Every gift, no matter the size, brings us closer to delivering both trusted news and the gift of reading to Vermont families.

,New Jersey Monitor,2025-07-16 18:32:22+00:00,New Jersey Monitor,NJ hospitals lose court battle challenging charity care,Nikita Biryukov,,,,,https://newjerseymonitor.com/2025/07/16/hospitals-lose-court-battle-challenging-charity-care/,"Forcing hospitals to accept patients who can't pay for care may not be fair, but it's not unlawful, the court rules.","Forcing hospitals to accept patients who can't pay for care may not be fair, but it's not unlawful, the court rules. (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)New Jersey law requiring hospitals to provide care to patients who cannot pay is constitutional despite the fact that the state does not reimburse them for all — or even most of — the costs associated with charity care, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday.
Charity care is not an unconstitutional taking, the court unanimously ruled, rejecting hospitals’ arguments that a law requiring they use their facilities, supplies, and services in exchange for subsidies that are less than their cost violates state and federal protections against government seizures of private property for public use without just compensation.
“Hospitals remain free to challenge their annual subsidy allocations through administrative channels and to lobby the Legislature to make policy changes that would address more broadly the concerns they raise,” Justice Douglas Fasciale wrote for a unanimous court. “But the charity care program does not run afoul of the Takings Clause.”
Reimbursements under charity care work on a sliding scale and base payments on the ratio of a hospital’s charity care revenue and its overall revenue. The 10 hospitals with the highest ratios can receive up to 96% reimbursement.
Beginning with the 11th hospital, the reimbursement rate decreases by two percentage points, to a statutory minimum of 43%, though the state in filings acknowledged that those reimbursement rates sometimes fell as low as 1%.
But even a 96% reimbursement may not cover most of a hospital’s expenses. The reimbursements are based on Medicaid rates rather than rates actually charged by hospitals, and law allows the state to reimburse at no less than 75% of Medicaid rates.
“The amounts of the subsidy over the years the program has been in place have frequently failed to even cover the basic cost of the care,” said Jim Robertson, chair of the health care department at Greenbaum, Rowe, Smith & Davis LLP, which represented the plaintiffs.
The justices found hospitals do not suffer a taking when dispensing medical supplies to charity care patients because hospitals maintain control over their property and supplies, dispensing their resources based on their own judgment of patient needs.
Fasciale noted a 2015 U.S. Supreme Court ruling called Horne v. Department of Agriculture that found the federal government could not require California raisin farmers to cede a portion of their crop to the government free of charge — but he added that hospitals face no such requirement in this case.
“If plaintiffs were required to hand over boxes of bandages or to surrender medical devices to the government or a third party, which could then sell or 23 dispose of those bandages or devices at will, this case would fall neatly into Horne’s analysis,” he wrote.
 Justice Douglas M.Fasciale wrote the unanimous decision upholding the constitutionality of charity care. (Ed Murray for New Jersey Monitor)
The ruling acknowledges comparisons to an earlier case, cited by hospitals, in which the court suggested reimbursement rates for attorneys charged with representing indigent clients in municipal court, but the justices said attorneys’ role as officers of the court made that case distinct. 
The court said requiring hospitals to bear the burdens created by charity care patients may not be fair, but said that, unlike with attorneys, it lacks the authority to tweak charity care reimbursement rates set by state lawmakers.
“We have no authority to propose, as a matter of policy, what a fair-though-not-constitutionally-mandated ratio of burden-bearing would be with respect to hospital services. That question is for the Legislature,” Fasciale wrote.
The state’s existing charity care formula, the court said, appeared to be the Legislature’s answer.
Hospital facilities likewise did not suffer an unconstitutional taking as a result of charity care, the justices ruled, because hospitals maintained access and control over their property even in the case of charity care patients. As with supplies, hospitals determine which facilities are needed for a given patient’s care, nor are charity care patients given full access or free rein of hospitals’ real property.
“Charity care only limits hospitals’ right to exclude and ability to bill patients who cannot pay for treatment; it does not involve an affirmative ‘right of access’ that would allow any individual to physically invade or occupy the hospital,” Fasciale said.
That analysis applied to “per se” takings, which see a government take property for use by itself or a third party, but the high court said charity care likewise did not amount to a regulatory taking, which limits an owner’s ability to use their property.
Though the court acknowledged charity care harms hospitals economically — the first prong of a three-factor test — they ruled it failed to meet the other two bars.
The second prong addresses whether regulation interferes with investment-backed expectations. The judges said investors in this case could foresee losses as a result of charity care because of the longstanding nature of the state’s charity care requirement and health care’s status as a regulated industry.
Hospitals failed the third prong because the public benefits of charity care outweigh the harm to hospitals, the court said.
The New Jersey high court’s decision may not mark the end of the legal fight over charity care. Robertson said the hospitals were considering appealing the decision to the nation’s high court.
“We believe the Court’s analysis is flawed in determining whether the Charity Care Program constitutes a physical taking and invasion of the hospitals’ property and is contrary to the trend of United States Supreme Court decisions in the last decade finding wrongful physical takings occurring in regulated industries and activities,” he said. “The option of pursuing a petition for certiorari by SCOTUS is under consideration.”

Ron DeSantis met on Tuesday, July 1, at the state's new deportation facility in the middle of the Everglades. (Via governor's X feed)Gov. Ron DeSantis appears to be cooling off, for now at least, on a plan to build a second state-run immigrant detention center at the Florida National Guard training site in Clay County.
The governor won’t consider building another temporary detention facility at the Camp Blanding Joint Training Center until the one in the Everglades reaches capacity, saying during a Wednesday press conference in Tampa that the existing site could easily fit 3,000 to 4,000 people.
“But what I don’t want to do is set up Blanding if, you know, one is 60% full and then the other is 40%,” DeSantis said during the press conference. “I’d rather just channel everyone to [Alligator Alcatraz] since it’s easier.”
Miccosukee Tribe wants to join lawsuit to halt the Everglades immigrant detention center

The governor visited Tampa to appoint Spring Hill Republican state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia as the state’s chief financial officer. He replaces Jimmy Patronis, who now serves in the U.S. House.
Last week, the governor said construction of an immigrant detention center in Camp Blanding would depend on demand from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. But DeSantis’ recent comments marked a shift from the hype with which state officials spoke about it before detainees started arriving at the site at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
The Florida Division of Emergency Management is the state agency in charge of the potential construction in Camp Blanding, which its top official teased during President Donald Trump’s visit to the Everglades detention center.
“I would say right after our wonderful Independence Day, we will be starting construction there in that facility,” DEM director Kevin Guthrie said during a roundtable with Trump on July 1.
Still, DeSantis said the immigrant detention center in the Everglades might reach capacity within the next two weeks.
So far, the state has lacked transparency about the number of people at the detention center, with Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announcing that hundreds would start arriving on July 2.
The most detailed information about the detainees has come from the Miami Herald, which published a list on Sunday of the 750 detainees housed there, including more than 250 people without criminal convictions or pending charges in the country.
Answering questions about the timeline for opening a detention center at Camp Blanding, the governor has emphasized the bidding process for companies. Construction at the airstrip in the Big Cypress National Preserve took eight days and started days after Uthmeier publicly rolled out the plan.
“I don’t want to be creating some structure that can hold 2,000 illegal aliens, and then we end up having, like, 150 there after a week,” DeSantis said Wednesday.
The Jacksonville Immigrant Rights Alliance has organized rallies against the plan for Camp Blanding, and it is planning another one on Saturday.
“We’re tired of political points and political careers being made off of the backs of hard-working Floridians, whether that be our immigrant brothers and sisters that are being persecuted and rounded up, or just the Floridian taxpayers, who are also underwater with bills,” said Maria Garcia-Rodriguez, a lead organizer for the alliance, in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.

(Getty Images)Indiana students continued to make gains in math this spring, but statewide reading scores remained largely unchanged, according to new ILEARN assessment data released Wednesday.
The results, presented at the State Board of Education’s monthly meeting in Indianapolis, show that 42.1% of students in grades three through eight scored at or above proficiency in math on the 2025 ILEARN exam, up more than five percentage points since 2021. 
English/language arts proficiency, however, held steady at 40.6% — up just 0.1 points from last year and essentially flat over the past four years.
Data released by IDOE reported 31.2% of Hoosier students passed both the math and English sections of ILEARN. That’s also slightly up from last year’s spring test results, which showed that 30.8% earned dual passing scores.
“While we are positively moving and improving in math, there is an urgent need to support middle school students in English/language arts,” said Indiana Secretary of Education Katie Jenner. “It is essential that our schools and parents/families continue to work together and stay laser-focused on increasing student learning and success.”
The annual ILEARN assessment is administered by Hoosier schools each spring and serves as Indiana’s primary K-8 standardized test.
Some scores up — others down
Compared to 2024, all grades except third showed math improvement. Eighth-grade students posted the largest year-over-year gain of 3.1%, according to IDOE data.
Third grade proficiency dropped nearly a percentage point, however.
The 2025 results revealed passing math scores for 51.5% of third graders; 49.2% of fourth graders; 41.5% of fifth graders; 39.7% of sixth graders; 35.9% of seventh graders; and 34.5% of eighth graders.
Math proficiency rates have increased in every grade since 2021.
Sixth and eighth grades saw the largest jumps — each up 6.7% — followed by seventh grade, up 5.4%, and fourth grade, up 5.5%. Fifth and third graders saw smaller increases of 2.9% and 2.8%, respectively.


But performance in English/language arts, or ELA, has been mixed. 
While third through sixth graders improved slightly compared to 2021, seventh- and eighth-grade students scored lower than they did four years ago. The most notable drop was among seventh graders, whose ELA proficiency fell 3.2% since 2021 and nearly 4 points from last year. 
The 2025 data showed only 37.8% of seventh graders passed the ELA exam, the lowest passage rate of any grade level.
Overall, ELA scores in most grades shifted within just a one-point range compared to 2024.
Black students posted the largest year-over-year ELA gains, up 0.9%. Black and Hispanic students additionally had the highest growth in math, with both demographic groups increasing scores by 2%.
Students in special education programs also outpaced their general education peers in ELA growth — state data showed a 1.3% boost in performance.
Students receiving free or reduced-price meals saw stronger math gains of 1.4%.
English learners improved in math but saw a 1.1% decline in ELA after making progress the year prior.
A shift in testing strategy
The latest ILEARN scores come as the state prepares to roll out a redesigned test format.
Beginning in the upcoming 2025–26 school year, all Indiana schools will transition to a “through-year” assessment model featuring three checkpoint tests and a shortened summative assessment at the school year’s end. State leaders said the goal is to provide real-time data and allow earlier intervention for struggling students.
Indiana schools get legislative green light to break up ILEARN testing throughout school year

The new system was already piloted in more than 1,350 schools, which administered more than 720,000 checkpoint assessments during the 2024–25 academic year. 
“The new ILEARN Checkpoints, launching statewide in the upcoming school year, will provide a beginning, middle and end-of-year look at student performance,” Jenner said. “This will be key to knowing early and often if a student has mastered certain knowledge or skills, or if they may still be struggling, ensuring the student has increased, personalized support.”
IDOE officials said they’re additionally working to expand both literacy and math interventions statewide. 
Initiatives include literacy-focused teacher training, targeted reading and math tutoring grants for families, and new screeners to identify struggling students in early grades.
New legislation enacted this year — House Enrolled Act 1634 — mandates math screeners for grades K-2 and directs schools to provide targeted support for students not meeting grade-level expectations.
“The literacy and numeracy skills developed in early grades are essential as students begin to explore career options, engage in hands-on learning, and ultimately, make decisions about their next steps after graduation,” Gov. Mike Braun said in a statement. “While we continue to see students growing in math proficiency, this year’s results remind us all of the need to continue our focus in both early and adolescent literacy.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.


Ballot access in ND
To gain ballot access in North Dakota, organizers of a political party need to provide a petition that includes at least 7,000 signatures from qualified electors for approval by the secretary of state.


“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska state leaders filed a lawsuit against Colorado on Wednesday seeking to have the U.S. Supreme Court assert the Cornhusker State’s century-old water rights to the South Platte River that crosses state lines.
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen, announcing the legal action at a news conference with Nebraska Attorney General Mike Hilgers and other state and local officials, said, “Every drop of water matters.” 
Pillen and Hilgers accused Colorado officials of siphoning off more and more water every day, even as Nebraska had been “nice” with Colorado, which has seen increases in housing, agricultural and business development along the waterway.
“We’re here to put our gloves on,” Pillen said, to defend what he called a “multi-generation investment” afforded under the South Platte River Compact that took effect in 1926.

“We’re going to fight like heck. We’re going to get every drop of water,” Pillen continued Wednesday. “We’ve been losing to Colorado on this issue for too long. It’s time we win.”
Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser called Wednesday’s lawsuit “unfortunate” and said Pillen and Hilgers “put politics above farming communities and the regional agricultural economy.”
“The failure to look for reasonable solutions and to turn to litigation is both unfortunate and predictable given the misguided effort driving the proposed canal,” Weiser said in a statement.
‘They want everything’
Hilgers said his team had exercised all options in communications with Weiser’s office before filing the 55-page complaint before the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The complaint accuses Colorado of violating the interstate compact between Colorado and Nebraska, which was ratified in the states in 1923 and enacted federally in 1926. Under the agreement, Nebraska is entitled to at least 120 cubic feet of water per second each day of the summer, during irrigation season.

Hilgers said it’s hard to say precisely how long more water than allowed has been taken and that it’s getting worse, an assertion Colorado officials denied in 2022. So far this summer, Hilgers said, Nebraska has gotten its mandated water flows about half the time, averaging 75 cubic feet per second of water daily.
Nebraska’s Western Irrigation District was also recently forced to shut off the majority of its surface water irrigation due to a lack of water from the South Platte River, despite the compact, according to the lawsuit.
Pillen said Colorado is storing more water for its “upstream economy,” which he said comes at the expense of Colorado and Nebraska farmers, with Nebraska’s western neighbors having “no interest in anything being fair and just.”
“They want absolutely everything, they’re even stealing the water from their own farmers, for crying out loud,” Pillen told reporters.
‘All-front war’
The interstate compact also allows Nebraska to construct the “Perkins County Canal,” a major water project through Keith County and into Colorado that would allow Nebraska to divert at least 500 cubic feet of water per second in the winter, during non-irrigation season. 
Nebraska is also afforded “eminent domain” over some Colorado land to build the canal, meaning the state could seize private land if needed.

State lawmakers, to the tune of more than $600 million, have approved funding to build a canal up to 1,000 cubic feet of water per second to capture more water flow in above-average water years. Nebraska officials say newly captured water would flow statewide and is not just focused on western Nebraska.
According to the court filing, Nebraska officials in January tried to purchase land from landowners in Sedgwick County, Colorado, at 115% of fair market value, deals that ultimately fell through. Nebraska pledged to take land “only if the parties failed to reach amicable terms.”
Hilgers said the situation escalated to an “all-front war” in the past year, with Hilgers and Pillen accusing Colorado officials of stepping up opposition, including through local Colorado landowners.
Nebraska-Colorado ‘impasse’ reached
Hilgers said he and his team have had many conversations with their Colorado counterparts but are at an “impasse,” largely over the project’s scope, including canal size, location and Nebraska’s eminent domain rights, a provision Weiser has said he is ready to challenge Nebraska on.

The eminent domain provisions are believed to be one of a kind among any interstate compacts in the nation’s history, according to Hilgers.
“There is no alternative forum capable of fully resolving the claims Nebraska asserts against Colorado, which are of such seriousness and dignity as to justify the exercise of the court’s jurisdiction,” the complaint to the Supreme Court states.
Weiser said that if the Supreme Court does greenlight the “wasteful project,” it will force Colorado water users to build additional projects to lessen the impact of the canal. He encouraged “collaboration and collaboration, rather than litigation,” which could lead to a “durable and thoughtful solution” that increases regional resiliency and agricultural strength.
In 2022, a spokesperson for Colorado Gov. Jared Polis called the project a “canal to nowhere” and a “boondoggle.”
Polis on Wednesday called the lawsuit “meritless” and said the state had continued to meet with Nebraska in “good faith” despite its efforts to intimidate some Colorado landowners. He reasserted that his state has always complied with the South Platte River Compact.
“This escalation by Nebraska is needless, and Colorado will take all steps necessary to aggressively defend Colorado water users, landowners, and our rural economy,” Polis said in a statement.
Pillen, asked whether he had talked to Polis about the canal or lawsuit, said plainly: “No.”
“The bottom line: He and I do not agree one iota. And there’s no sense in further conversations,” Pillen said. “I’m not playing goober politics on this. We’re going to fight for Nebraska.”

Former Gov. Pete Ricketts, now a Republican U.S. senator for Nebraska, unearthed and reinvigorated the compact in 2022 with Hilgers, the then-speaker of the Legislature.
Hilgers said it was probably always “inevitable” that the U.S. Supreme Court would decide the issue. He acknowledged that while a minority of state senators have tried to claw back funding for the Perkins County Canal, he anticipated that future efforts to do so would continue to fail.
‘The future of Nebraska’
Jesse Bradley, director of the newly merged Nebraska Department of Water, Energy and Environment as of July 1, said his team would continue to move forward with the project, parallel to the litigation, estimating that permitting and design would finish by 2028 for construction to begin.
The hope is that water will flow through the new canal no later than 2032.
“This is critical to the future of Nebraska,” Bradley said. “We will continue to push forward aggressively.”

Also joining Wednesday’s news conference were representatives of the Nebraska Public Power District, Central Platte Natural Resources District, Central Nebraska Power and Irrigation District, Twin Platte Natural Resources District, the Nebraska Western Irrigation District, the South Platte Natural Resources District and the state’s chief water officer, Matt Manning.
Hilgers estimated the state lawsuit could cost a couple of million dollars, including hiring outside experts or legal counsel, and take three to five years before the Supreme Court decides. 
Pillen said Nebraska would not “save pennies” on the project and would have the “A Team 100% of the time” to win, “not a shadow of a doubt.”
Weiser estimated that “when the dust finally settles,” more than a billion dollars would be spent over a possible decade of litigation, and “no one in Nebraska or Colorado will be better off.”
Hilgers said he’s thankful the U.S. Supreme Court will decide the issue.
“We could maybe not get everything we want in front of the Supreme Court. But if we don’t file, we will lose. Period, full stop,” Hilgers said. “And what we will lose will so far outstrip the cost of this particular project that will really be a ‘shame on us’ moment if we don’t actually follow through.”

Founded in 1976, the poverty law advocacy and research center worked “to promote equal justice for all residents of the Commonwealth by serving as an advocate for low income and other vulnerable members of society,” according to its website.  
Now, nearly 50 years later, the organization “has faced increasing challenges sustaining our funding model — particularly in today’s political and philanthropic environment,” said spokesperson Natalie Chambers. 
“The national funding landscape has grown increasingly competitive, especially for organizations that serve immigrants, refugees and undocumented individuals,” Chambers said. “That’s been further complicated by the chilling effect of the current federal administration’s rhetoric and policy priorities, which have made fundraising for this kind of work even more difficult.” 
The center’s remaining 11 staff members will now lose their jobs at the end of the month, Chambers said. The “majority of our team” already lost their jobs earlier this year during a temporary suspension, she said. 
“In many ways, this has felt like a (not-so) perfect storm. Looking back, we know there were changes we needed to make earlier to brace for what’s become an incredibly stormy environment for nonprofits doing justice-centered work,” Chambers said. “Even with strong partners and a mission we deeply believe in, we reached a point where continuing responsibly was no longer possible.” 
Representatives for the center have testified in Frankfort on high profile bills and issues, including legislation to block transgender inmates from using public funds to access certain medical treatments; the omnibus and controversial anti-crime House Bill 5; and legislation to trim the state’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). 
“This decision (to close) was not made lightly,” Shay Hutchinson, KEJC’s executive director, said in a statement. “It reflects the challenging funding landscape facing nonprofit legal advocacy organizations nationwide, not the strength or significance of our mission.”
The center is winding down all its work “responsibly” to make sure partners and clients “experience as little disruption as possible,” according to a Tuesday news release. 
“We’re proud of the impact we’ve made and the partnerships we’ve built,” Hutchinson said. “Though KEJC is closing, the fight for justice in Kentucky continues. We hope our legacy inspires others to carry it forward.”

Demas
This story was originally reported by Orion Rummler of The 19th.  Meet Orion and read more of his reporting on gender, politics and policy.
Millions of Americans are expected to lose health care coverage through President Donald Trump’s “one big, beautiful” tax and spending law — and LGBTQ+ Americans, who rely heavily on social services due to high rates of poverty and disability, are among those who will be most impacted. Experts say that widespread loss of health care, coupled with rising discrimination and fewer workplace protections, will create a worst-case scenario for LGBTQ+ rights.
“These support programs are being cut amid an increased environment of hostility towards LGBTQ+ people,” said Brad Sears, distinguished scholar of law and policy at the Williams Institute at UCLA School of Law. “We’re really seeing this coming together … of different pressures that are going to lead to poverty and unemployment among LGBTQ+ people.”
The law issues extensive cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) — two programs designed for low-income and disabled Americans that many LGBTQ+ people need to survive. LGBTQ+ adults are twice as likely as non-LGBTQ+ adults to use Medicaid as their main insurance, according to the Williams Institute, and are more likely to experience food insecurity and rely on SNAP benefits. Medicaid is also the primary insurance for Americans living with HIV.
Medicaid cuts will profoundly impact disabled LGBTQ+ adults and those with low incomes, according to a recent Williams Institute report, as well as those raising children. People of color, transgender adults, and cisgender lesbian and bisexual women will be especially impacted.
“It’s a sort of death by a thousand cuts,” said Katie Keith, director of the center for health policy and the law at the O’Neill Institute at Georgetown Law.
The law attaches more documentation and a work requirement to Medicaid, while putting more costs on hospitals when patients don’t have insurance and can’t pay. People will lose coverage altogether or have less comprehensive coverage, Keith said.
The law, which goes into effect next December, cuts federal spending on Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program by more than $1 trillion over the next decade. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that 11.8 million Americans will lose health care coverage over the next decade due to the law’s Medicaid cuts. Roughly 1.8 million LGBTQ+ adults use Medicaid as their primary health insurance, including more than 1.2 million lesbian and bisexual women, per the Williams Institute.
The law creates an 80-hours-a-month work requirement in order to access Medicaid — although recipients can volunteer for 80 hours a month instead or enroll in at least a part-time education program. These requirements go into effect in early 2027. Exceptions are granted to disabled adults, pregnant women — the law only refers to women, leaving out pregnant trans men or nonbinary people —  and parents of young children, but experts say it’s unclear how meaningful these exceptions will be and whether patients are aware of them.
“The Congressional Budget Office has really pinpointed work requirements as what’s going to lead to disenrollment,” Sears said. “The red tape, the bureaucracy, disenrolls people who would otherwise be eligible.”
Medicaid recipients will now have to file paperwork every six months to prove that they are working or volunteering for 80 hours a month, or to request an exemption, said Lindsey Dawson, director of LGBTQ health policy at KFF. These requirements, which have never been issued on a national level before, are expected to dramatically reduce Medicaid enrollment, she said. If someone is already navigating difficult circumstances, like an unstable living situation or surviving on minimal income, they probably won’t be able to keep up with additional paperwork.
The 19th spoke with several LGBTQ+ people on Medicaid who doubt that work requirement exceptions for disabled people and parents will help them keep their coverage, even though they qualify for now. They still expect to lose their health care due to the burdens of this new paperwork, or because of how much money hospitals are expected to lose under this new law.
“Why does it have to be like this? It really feels overwhelming, because it doesn’t seem like it should be this hard to make sure that people can go to the doctor,” said Frankie Brletich, a 30-year-old nonbinary person living in Philadelphia.
They know how hard it can be to navigate the red tape of health insurance, prescriptions and doctor’s visits as a disabled person. They expect these new Medicaid work requirements to make it worse, and to ultimately discourage disabled people from seeking out coverage altogether. Under Trump’s new tax law, Brletich has been worried about losing the Medicaid coverage that took them so long to get.
They have been unable to work for over a year, as they experience chronic fatigue, chronic pain and have a history of mental illness. They applied for Medicaid in December when they left their job and didn’t get approved until March this year. In the meantime, they were uninsured. They ran out of psychiatric medications as well as their testosterone prescription, leaving them in a depressive state as their mental health declined. As they left their employer-sponsored private insurance and switched to Medicaid, they had to deal with pharmacy mishaps, change medical providers and get a new therapist.
Soon, they will face even more red tape to access the Medicaid coverage that they sorely need. Meanwhile, they are working with a lawyer to apply for Social Security Disability Insurance, which sends monthly payments to people with a disability that hinders their ability to work. The first time they applied for SSDI, they were denied. They’re appealing that decision.
Although Trump’s new tax and spending law includes exceptions for disabled Americans in its work or volunteer requirements, the law puts the burden of accessing those exceptions onto disabled people like Brletich.
“There’s still the administrative burden of paperwork that is then put on to me to re-up every time and to constantly prove that I am ‘still disabled,’” they said.
The Movement Advancement Project, which tracks LGBTQ+ policy, estimates that between three to five million LGBTQ+ people in the United States have disabilities, including 2 in 5 transgender adults. This group faces steep barriers to health care access, due to medical discrimination and lower rates of health insurance. LGBTQ+ people are also more likely to experience mental health conditions that impact daily life, compared to the general population.
Although these Medicaid cuts will harm many Americans, Keith is especially concerned about how it will impact transgender people, since health care access for this group is being threatened on multiple fronts. Starting in 2026, insurance sold on the individual and small-group marketplace will no longer cover gender-affirming care, which is expected to raise costs overall. In Congress, Republican lawmakers had planned to prohibit Medicaid from covering gender-affirming care for transgender adults and minors altogether, but that provision was dropped in the final version of the spending bill.
“Any time you are fraying the social safety net, as they are doing here, you are inevitably going to hard vulnerable populations, including transgender communities,” Keith said.
Another Medicaid recipient in Washington state told The 19th that she believes carve-outs for work exceptions will still be a significant barrier for disabled Americans. She asked to remain anonymous due to prior experiences receiving death threats for her advocacy as a trans woman.
“If you have a significant disability or multiple disabilities, if somebody cuts you off of your health care and then sends you a letter saying, ‘By the way, there’s this administrative process by which you can get back on’ — it is the people with disabilities that are going to be least able to navigate that system, including me,” she said.
As a disabled woman in her mid-50s with an annual income of about $8,000, she would not be able to see a doctor without Medicaid. She enrolled in Apple Health, the expanded Medicaid program in Washington, in January. Until that point, it had been almost five years since she had had health insurance or seen a doctor.
Due to a combination of factors — depression, severe social anxiety, and chronic pain — applying was too difficult. And she couldn’t see a doctor without insurance, because paying out of pocket was just not possible. So she avoided medical care, and also largely avoided leaving the house. If she loses coverage again, it may take her another four years to re-enroll, she said; that’s how long it took her to navigate the process the first time.
Costs for states to run their Medicaid programs are also expected to rise, Dawson said, as the new law effectively decreases the revenue that states can generate from their programs. Some states may have to shrink their Medicaid programs if they can’t afford to run it under the new law.
“We have not historically seen changes to our health care system that would result in coverage losses like this before,” she said. “It’s really a significant rollback in federal support for health coverage, and I think states will be faced with tough choices.”
Considering the scope of these cuts, Cassidy Vare, a Philadelphia resident who relies on Medicaid coverage for her and her two children, is not feeling confident about the future of health care in Pennsylvania. Since her children are 13 and 5 years old, and she’s currently attending school, she should be exempt from the law’s strict work requirements. Regardless, she is terrified of losing care. Hospitals in the state are expected to lose about $4.5 billion per year over the next decade because of Medicaid cuts, per a local news outlet.
“We have some time to figure out what we’re going to do next, but … a year from now looks kind of scary,” she said. Without Medicaid, Vare would need to drop out of her master’s program to get a job with health insurance — which would disrupt her plan to secure a more stable and high-paying career for her family.
Vare, as well as other Medicaid recipients that The 19th spoke with, had no knowledge of any exemptions for parents in her situation written into the new law until The 19th informed her about it. From her perspective, health care is being taken away, and her family’s future is at stake.
“It looks like Medicaid is going away, even if they’re pretending that it’s still going to exist,” she said. “I don’t know whether my state will be able to cover my insurance or not.”
These fears are not unfounded, Dawson from KFF said. State Medicaid programs may change, and people are expected to lose coverage on a large scale. That said, anyone eligible for Medicaid coverage under the new law should pursue that access however they can, she said.
“When you hear that the federal government itself expects 12 million people to lose insurance coverage, it’s hard not to imagine what will happen if you’re one of those individuals,” she said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/IMG_4522-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-16 14:18:57.524683

The request comes amid new work-or-school requirements for Medicaid enrollees in most other states. (iStock / Getty Images Plus)COLUMBIA — Thousands more people in South Carolina could get Medicaid coverage under a request from the state to expand the program to working low-income parents.
While Gov. Henry McMaster wrote officials in January about the state’s impending request, the state’s Medicaid agency didn’t actually submit it until late last month, after gathering public comments and holding hearings. The submission happened to come in the midst of congressional negotiations over the GOP-pushed federal law signed July 4, which requires adults in states that expanded Medicaid to prove they’re working, going to school or volunteering at least 80 hours each month.
That part of the massive package, slated to begin at the end of 2026, does not apply to South Carolina, according to the state’s Medicaid agency. The Palmetto State is among 10 states that never expanded eligibility to all adults with incomes up to 138% of the federal poverty level, as intended under the 2010 law known as Obamacare.
SC governor asks to expand Medicaid eligibility for working parents

However, South Carolina is still seeking its own, albeit very limited, version of an expansion.
If the Trump administration approves South Carolina’s request, an estimated 11,400 parents with incomes between 67% and 100% of the federal poverty level could be newly covered by Medicaid. And they would have to meet those same 80-hours-per-month requirements as new federal law mandates in most other states. The difference would be that those rules would apply only to South Carolinians newly qualified for coverage.
The goal is to help close a health care coverage gap for those parents, according to the state’s application, submitted June 23. Under existing rules, parents who make more than 67% of the federal poverty line, which is just $21,540 annually for a family of four, can’t get Medicaid coverage. But federal subsidies to buy private insurance on the marketplace don’t kick in until 100% of the poverty line, or $32,150 for that same family of four.
That can discourage people from searching for a higher-paying job out of fear of losing their health insurance, officials wrote in the state’s application.
“This creates a perverse financial incentive for individuals to keep their incomes artificially low for risk of losing healthcare coverage and bearing the full cost of health services,” the application reads.
An estimated 17,700 people would qualify for the program under the changes, according to the state’s application to the federal Medicaid agency. A federal funding formula would limit the actual number to 11,400.
Officials expect hitting that enrollment cap to take five years, according to the application.
The changes wouldn’t apply to people already enrolled in the state’s Medicaid program, including elderly, pregnant and disabled people. Childless adults would remain ineligible for Medicaid in South Carolina’s program, according to the application.
The requirements are similar to those already required for people receiving benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), often called food stamps. People making up to 100% of the federal poverty level can continue qualifying for SNAP if they can prove they’re working up to 80 hours each month, unless they qualify for an exemption.
The overlap was intentional, Medicaid spokesman Jeff Leieritz said previously. If a person is already proving they’re working to get SNAP, they should more easily be able to receive the expanded Medicaid benefits, he said.
As of 2020, 521,660 South Carolinians under the age of 65 were uninsured, according to the most recent data from the state Revenue and Fiscal Affairs Office.
Sue Berkowitz, director of Appleseed Legal Justice Center, said she was glad to see that more people would have access to health care. She worried the program still had too many barriers, since getting a job or volunteering isn’t always easy for people without transportation, people in rural areas with fewer opportunities and people who can’t afford child care, she said.
More exemptions for those situations would allow even more people who fall in that coverage gap to access health care, said Berkowitz, who is part of a group advocating for the state to expand Medicaid.
“Health care shouldn’t be something that’s dangled in front of you or used as a stick” to get people to work, Berkowitz said.
By 2043, SC hospitals could receive $2.4B less to treat Medicaid patients

The program is meant to be narrowly tailored to working families, the Medicaid agency said in the application, addressing similar concerns raised during two public hearings.
“By maintaining a community engagement requirement for participation, the program aims to reinforce the proven link between improved economic self-sufficiency and improved health,” the application reads.
South Carolina has been pursuing similar requirements that people work in order to receive Medicaid benefits for years.
The federal Medicaid agency approved a similar waiver for the state in December 2019, during President Donald Trump’s first term. That version, however, would have applied the work-or-school requirements to all Medicaid enrollees, not just those newly qualified. It was paused when the COVID-19 pandemic began, and the Biden administration later revoked the permission.
McMaster sent a letter to federal officials in January asking them to speed along the state’s forthcoming application. The state Medicaid agency took public comments on the proposal from April 30 to May 31 and held public hearings May 6 and May 13.

The change followed a settlement between NorthWestern and the Montana Consumer Counsel, as well as several large customers including the “Montana Large Customer Group,” a coalition of large businesses including refineries; Walmart; the Northern Cheyenne Tribe; and the University of Montana.
The monopoly utility filed a rate structure in late June that would replace the nearly 17% increase on residential electricity bills NorthWestern enacted in May with a more modest increase. The May increase was done using a rarely-used statute allowing the company to enact their own rate increases without approval, if the PSC has not acted on a requested increase for nine months.
During a July 1 meeting, PSC commissioner Brad Molnar criticized the move by Northwestern to ask for the lower rate increase, after seeking multiple higher increases, as “illusory,” and a “communication tool.”
“They’re getting beat up for what they’ve done, now suddenly they’re good guys,” said Molnar, who along with commissioner Randy Pinocci, voted against the increase.
The rate approved by a 3-2 vote of the PSC would mean the average ratepayer faces a total of $114 per month, down from an expected $118, on the electric portion of their power bill.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/electricity-2048x1366-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 14:18:57.524683

(Photo via Google Earth)A Cedar Rapids nursing home has been fined $13,000 after a series of alleged medication errors.
According to state inspection records, on May 23, 2025, a resident of the Heritage Specialty Care nursing home received, in error, 12 medications that were to have been administered to another resident.
The resident who received the medications later became lethargic and confused and their oxygen saturation levels dropped, inspectors allege. The resident was taken by ambulance to a hospital, where they were admitted to the intensive care unit and treated for medication-type poisoning. The resident was hospitalized for four days, according to the inspectors’ reports.
The nurse who had administered the drugs reportedly told inspectors she had to give medications to 13 residents that day, there were a lot of call-lights on due to residents needing assistance, and she was the only nurse on duty at the time and was being assisted by one nursing assistant.
A few weeks later, on June 4, the facility allegedly failed to properly assess a female resident and intervene after the woman became unresponsive and was sent to the hospital with a blood glucose level of 25 — anything below 54 is considered dangerous, requiring immediate action — after being given insulin without eating their meal.
Inspectors reported that they were unable to observe the resident during their investigation, which took place in early July, because “she was still hospitalized during the investigation.”
In their written findings, the state inspectors said that when they asked Heritage’s director of nursing “what he felt the cause of the error was, he reported he did not think there was an error.”
The hospital involved in the incident reported Heritage Specialty Care for alleged abuse related to neglect that resulted in a hypoglycemic resident, according to state inspectors.
Six days after that incident occurred, on June 10, an employee of Heritage Specialty Care incorrectly administered 12 or 13 units of insulin for a resident rather than the expected 17 units, inspectors reported. The resident soon became unresponsive with a blood glucose level of 25 and was sent to a hospital for treatment, inspectors alleged.
Heritage Specialty Care is part of a chain of nursing homes operated by Care Initiatives of West Des Moines. A company representative said Tuesday that she not able to comment at that time on the state’s findings.



Woman dies after fall, medication error  
An assisted living center where a resident died after a fall and being given the wrong medication has been fined $6,000 by the state.
State inspection records indicated that a female resident of Meadowview Memory Care Village in Cedar Rapids fell to the floor on the evening of Nov. 15, 2024, and was taken to a hospital for an evaluation. The hospital reported no acute medical issues and the resident returned to Meadowview.
The next day, the Meadowview staff reported the resident was groggy and sleepy, and was not eating or walking as she normally would be. The resident also appeared to display weakness on one side and was yelling out in pain while holding her head in her hands and rocking back and forth.
“The screaming/yelling became more intense around 5 p.m.,” inspectors later stated in their report, referencing interviews with the Meadowview staff. Around 6:30 p.m., which was roughly 24 hours after the fall, a nurse realized she had mistakenly given the woman another resident’s medications.
The resident sat in a wheelchair near the nurses’ station, yelling and crying “off and on until around 8:30 p.m., when she began to get drowsy and sleepy,” inspectors reported. Around 9:30 p.m., the inspectors reported, the staff noticed the woman was no longer breathing. A nurse was summoned, did an assessment, and pronounced the woman dead.
According to inspectors, the Linn County medical examiner later reported that he didn’t remember anyone telling him of the medication error while adding that he believed the medications involved would not have caused the woman’s death. The medical examiner indicated he suspected the tenant had a stroke that might have been connected to the fall the day before her death.
The resident’s primary care provider allegedly told inspectors she was not informed the resident was weak on one side, unable to walk, was yelling in pain, and holding her head and rocking back and forth, adding that such behavior could have been symptoms of a stroke. Had she been informed, she reportedly told inspectors, she would have considered sending the resident back to the hospital for a brain scan.
Dallas Urbain, a manager with Meadowview, said the correct administration of medication and the prompt reporting of a patient’s change in condition are among the facility’s highest priorities and any errors that occur are taken seriously. In this instance, she said, corrective action, including staff training, was taken.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Heritage-Specialty-Care-in-Cedar-Rapids.jpg,,,2025-07-16 14:18:57.524683

And while it’s unlikely enough Republicans break with their party to substantially change the bill, key votes will serve as fodder for campaign ads heading into next year’s midterm elections.The Trump administration sent Congress the rescissions request in early June, allowing the White House budget office to legally freeze funding on the programs in the proposal for 45 days.The House voted mostly along party lines later that month to send the rescissions bill to the Senate, where Republican leaders have spent weeks addressing concerns raised by their own lawmakers.At the center of the dispute is how cutting foreign aid for dozens of programs, including those addressing global health and democracy, would affect American influence around the globe.GOP senators also raised qualms during a hearing about how eliminating funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting would impact rural communities and emergency alert systems. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides funding for National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service and hundreds of local stations throughout the country.South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds announced Tuesday he’s secured an agreement with White House budget director Russ Vought to move $9.4 million from an account within the Interior Department to at least two dozen Native American radio stations in multiple states.Those include Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota and Wisconsin, according to Rounds’ office.Republican leaders also agreed to keep funding for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, whole by removing that rescission from the bill. PEPFAR is a global health program to combat HIV/AIDS launched by former President George W. Bush.But those changes didn’t sway every Republican senator to support the bill. Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski voted against moving forward with debate on Tuesday night.Vice President JD Vance casting a tie-breaking vote was the only reason the proposal advanced to the vote-a-rama, which began early Wednesday afternoon. This is a developing story that will be updated.",,,,2025-07-16 14:18:57.524683

(Courtesy of Sioux Falls School District)Teacher contracts were signed in the spring and school district budgets were prepared months ago. But weeks before school starts, South Dakota schools are missing $25.8 million they planned to use for the upcoming school year, according to the state Education Department.
Distribution of congressionally approved funds were paused indefinitely by the U.S. Department of Education on June 30 for review. The department’s decision to withhold $6.8 billion in funds for education triggered alarms nationwide about how the lack of funding will affect hiring of staff as well as student enrichment, after-school and language-learning services.
Trump administration tells states it’s freezing $6.8 billion for K-12 school programs

The funding freeze affects several programs, including Title II-A (educator training and recruitment), Title III-A (English learner support), Title IV-A (student enrichment and after-school programs), migrant education, and adult education and literacy grants.
Sandra Waltman, director of public affairs for the South Dakota Education Association, said school districts are “scrambling” to figure out their budget without the federal funding. That could mean eliminating vacant positions ahead of the school year or dipping into reserves “as long as they can.”
“This undermines the trust the community has in their public schools. This ‘we’re going to give you money but not give you money’ situation makes families question whether their school is going to have the resources to provide an education,” Waltman said. “They might wonder if they should look elsewhere. Maybe that’s the point: to undermine the ability of the public school system to provide support to students who need them.”
Pause could lead to long-term, larger ripple effects
A coalition of Democratic attorneys general and organizations including the National Education Association and National Association for the Advancement of Colored People are challenging the funding freeze in court. The organizations say the administration’s delay is an illegal “impoundment” — a violation of the federal Impoundment Control Act, which bars the executive branch from withholding appropriated funds without congressional approval.


Federal fallout
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


The 1974 Impoundment Control Act lets the president propose canceling funds approved by Congress. Lawmakers have 45 days to approve the request; if they don’t, it’s denied. Meanwhile, agencies can be directed not to spend the funds during that time.
South Dakota Education Secretary Joseph Graves said in an emailed statement to South Dakota Searchlight that the funding could continue “without further interruption” once the federal department completes its review.
“The funding pause means that some schools in South Dakota will need to remain flexible as they prepare for the 2025-26 school year,” Graves said. He added that schools still have access to $57 million in some Title I funds, which are primarily used to support schools with a high percentage of students from low-income families. That available funding is the “lion’s share” of federal K-12 education funding in the state.
Waltman said her organization urged South Dakota congressional delegates to “make it clear to the Trump administration that South Dakota schools need these dollars.”
She said the funding freeze will lead to larger consequences.
“If those dollars aren’t restored and we don’t see meaningful investment from the state and federal level, it’ll be difficult for our schools to sustain,” Waltman said. “They’ll look at reducing staff and cutting programs, and some rural schools will struggle to stay open.”
Huron Superintendent Kraig Steinhoff said that the fear, uncertainty and concern because of the funding freeze is “unfortunate and unnecessary.” 
“It makes people question whether or not education is going to continue to be supported,” Stenhoff said, “and whether teaching is an occupation people should consider staying in.”
How schools are handling the missing funds
Huron relied on more than $760,000 in what are now frozen funds last school year, Steinhoff said, making it one of the largest recipients in the state. Sioux Falls, Rapid City, Oglala Lakota County and Todd County also receive large amounts of frozen funding.
Oglala Lakota, Sioux Falls and Huron use many of their funds for teacher, counselor and instructional coach salaries. 
Sioux Falls, the largest district in the state by number of students, has up to $3.5 million in federal funds affected by the pause.
That’s the equivalent of up to 40 full-time staff, said Kirk Zeeck, Sioux Falls assistant superintendent of academic achievement. About $1.5 million of that funding is used for instructional coaches providing professional development for teachers, including behavioral training and engagement strategies.

Most of the funding on pause at Huron goes toward salaries for extra teachers to reduce the student-to-teacher ratio and staff meant to assist and support students – such as migrant liaisons, summer school staff and paraprofessionals. The funding also goes toward transportation for elementary school students and other programs.
Since staff contracts have already been signed, schools are on the hook to pay for those even though the funding isn’t readily available, Steinhoff added.
For Oglala Lakota County, the paused funding is mostly used to support salaries of instructional coaches and counselors. That includes retention and recruitment bonuses for teachers in one of the most rural and impoverished districts in the state. The annual $1,500 retention bonus is paid out the first pay period of August, said Superintendent Connie Kaltenbach.
“Our district is going to do all we can to ensure we maintain all the funding as best as we can,” Kaltenbach said. “We’ll cinch the belt in other areas.”
If funding isn’t resumed in time, Kaltenbach said the district would likely stop professional development travel and advertising for vacant staff positions. She said she’ll maintain and protect counselor positions in the district “as best we can so students don’t bear the brunt of that.”
Freeze impacts after-school programs: ‘We’re a tool to break the cycle of poverty’
Federal funding for some after-school and summer programs throughout the state is included in the $25.8 million freeze. Those programs, identified as 21st Century Community Learning Centers, are created to provide children, especially low-income students, with a safe place to eat and spend time outside of school areas.
Waltman said families depend on the programs to “fill the gap between after school and when parents can get off work.” 
Frozen federal funding accounts for about 40% of the Boys and Girls Club of the Missouri River, according to Executive Director Pat Breen. The award is $246,741 a year, based on fiscal year 2024’s grant documents.
The organization operates the summer and after-school care program for the Wagner Community School District and Marty Indian School. Students are offered afternoon snacks and a meal each day, and they can stay until 8 p.m. during the school year or between 2 p.m. and 7 p.m. on weekdays during the summer.
The programs serve a combined 160 students per day, with more than 1,000 students rotating in and out of those slots last year.
“This is a vital mission,” Breen said. “We’re all about personal accountability and academic enrichment. We’re a tool to break the cycle of poverty.”
Funding for 21st Century programs will be reimbursed by the state Department of Education through August, according to the department. That’s because, since the grant funds cover projects over a five-year period, the department reserved a portion of last year’s awards to cover existing projects.
There are 25 active centers in South Dakota, according to the department.
Sarah Hanson, managing director for children, youth and families at Volunteers of America Dakotas, said the organization’s Kids Campus Central in Sioux Falls is “operating as normal” through mid-August because of the remaining funding from last year. In addition to the program, the organization’s missing $197,309 grant funded a dedicated Science, Technology, Engineering and Math tutor and transportation home for students whose families can’t pick them up.

Hanson said staff are preparing for the possibility they won’t receive funds in time for the new school year. They’re helping families seek other tuition assistance to help the program replace the frozen funding, including state Child Care Assistance, or scholarships.
“Our hope is that by starting early and being proactive, we can limit the number of families who are impacted,” Hanson said in an emailed statement. “Still, the loss of a funding stream this significant will have real effects.”
Hanson said transportation will be offered during the school year regardless of federal funding, because without it, “many families won’t be able to attend at all.”
Keiz Larson, executive director and CEO of YMCA of Rapid City, said her organization was not granted additional funding through August for two after-school programs in Box Elder and Fall River County because the programs restart in August. The YMCA is missing $147,695 between the two programs, based on fiscal year 2024 grant documents.
The after-school program in Box Elder serves the Douglas School District and Ellsworth Air Force Base with care, homework support and enrichment for students. YMCA is the only licensed elementary after-school and summer care provider in the rural Fall River County area, serving Edgemont. 
If the frozen funding isn’t released by the end of the week, it could permanently jeopardize care for over 120 families in both communities.
“It’s hard to start something back up after you close it,” Larson said.

(Provided by Volvo Cars) Volvo Cars will move production of its most popular vehicle to South Carolina to avoid tariffs that threaten to weaken the automaker’s profits, the company said Wednesday.
Volvo’s $1.2 billion factory in Ridgeville will start building the mid-sized XC60 sport-utility crossover in late 2026.
“As Volvo celebrates its 70th anniversary, the XC60 stands out as a growth driver …” reads a release from the automaker. “With over 2.7 million sold globally, the XC60 has officially surpassed the iconic 240 wagon to become Volvo’s best-selling model of all time.”
Volvo has previously stated its intention to add another car to the production line in Berkeley County, which is operating far below capacity — 13% according to industry estimates.
“Volvo Cars is committed to its long-held strategy of building where we sell — a principle that is more important now than ever,” a spokesperson said in the release. “As part of this strategy, Volvo Cars has previously communicated that it’s considering adding production of another model at our U.S. plant, which has a capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year.”
Volvo has said moving some production to the U.S. would help mute this country’s tariffs of 25% on all imported vehicles.
Hakan Samuelsson, Volvo’s CEO, said adding the XC60 to the Lowcountry plant “will further strengthen its position and attractiveness in the U.S. market while supporting and creating American manufacturing jobs.”
Luis Rezende, president of Volvo Cars Americas, called the XC60 “the right car for this market.”
“It offers the best of Volvo in a versatile size with the powertrain options to suit our U.S. customers,” he said.
The Lowcountry factory currently builds the all-electric EX90 SUV — a model that has been beset by production problems and sagging sales. Volvo sold just 7,797 EX90s globally through the first six months of this year.
By contrast, Volvo tallied 120,407 sales of its XC60 in the first half of 2025 – a 23% year-over-year increase and far more than any of the automaker’s other models. The XC60, currently built in Sweden and China, accounts for nearly two-thirds of all Volvo sales in the U.S. this year.
“As the fourth best-selling luxury plug-in hybrid in the U.S., it’s also an important bridge toward electrification for American drivers,” a spokesperson said. “This milestone builds on nearly a decade of Volvo Cars production in Charleston, marking the next chapter for Volvo’s most iconic nameplate, still a favorite for American drivers seeking comfort, safety, performance and real-world electrification.”
The production shifts follow significant financial problems Volvo announced earlier this week. The automaker said it would take a $1.2 billion cash impairment charge — an accounting term describing the lowered value of an asset — due to escalating tariff costs and delays in introducing new EV models.
The automaker specifically cited the EX90, saying “significant launch delays in the past and subsequent development costs” for that model have diminished its expected profitability. Volvo also said tariffs on the China-made ES90 battery powered hatchback sedan mean it can’t be sold profitably in the U.S.
“We have reassessed volume assumptions for these two cars,” Fredrick Hansson, Volvo’s chief financial officer, said in a statement, adding that “has resulted in a lower than planned lifecycle profitability.”
In May, Volvo announced layoffs of 5% of its Ridgeville workforce of 2,500 — or about 125 people. More recently, the automaker said it will cut about 3,000 white-collar jobs worldwide as part of a $1.9 billion plan to reduce costs.
In addition to slow sales, the EX90 — with a list price topping $80,000 — has received poor reviews because of ongoing software glitches in what Volvo has marketed as its most-connected and technologically advanced vehicle. Consumer Reports, for example, calls the EX90 “an unfinished electric SUV” with “buggy software, inactive features, lit-up warning lights” and “an extraordinary number of issues” that aren’t acceptable on a new car.
In addition to the EX90, the Ridgeville plant is currently building the Polestar 3 SUV for Volvo’s high-performance sister brand. They will continue to be built alongside the XC60, the automaker said.
Volvo, which is based in Sweden but majority-owned by China’s Geely Holding Group, announced plans to build its first and only U.S. plant in Ridgeville in 2015. The automaker, which received more than $200 million in incentives to locate its 2.3 million-square-foot factory off Interstate 26 in the Palmetto State, started production of its first car in 2018.
That first vehicle, the S60 sedan, was discontinued last year as the plant shifted its focus toward production of the EX90.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/volvo-south-carolina-1024x575.jpg,,,2025-07-16 14:18:57.524683

Abigail Spanberger is opening a financial and polling gap in the race for governor, outraising her Republican opponent Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears by nearly 2-to-1 last quarter and entering the final four months of Virginia’s statewide election season with more than triple the cash on hand.
New campaign finance filings show the Democrat raised a record-breaking $10.7 million in the second quarter — including $4.3 million in the final weeks of June — and ended the period with $15.2 million in the bank. Earle-Sears brought in $5.9 million over the same three months, finishing June with $4.5 million on hand.
In total, Spanberger has raised $27 million since launching her campaign in November 2023, while Earle-Sears has raised $11.6 million since last fall.
Spanberger widens lead as Virginia voters prioritize cost of living, personal freedoms

The funding gulf is mirrored in the polls. According to a new survey released Wednesday by Virginia Commonwealth University’s L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, Spanberger leads Earle-Sears 49% to 37% among likely voters — a 12-point advantage that has widened since December, when Spanberger led 45% to 35%.
“Across the commonwealth, Abigail hears from Virginians who are feeling squeezed by high costs, frustrated by the chaos coming out of Washington, and are ready to elect a governor who will put Virginia families first — not blind loyalty to a political party,” said Samson Signori, Spanberger’s campaign manager.
“We are incredibly grateful for this record outpouring of support,” he continued. “Virginians know that as our next governor, Abigail will work every day to lower costs, strengthen our schools, protect Virginia jobs, and keep our communities safe. And over the next four months, our campaign will use every minute to make sure Abigail’s winning message reaches every community in Virginia.”
The $10.7 million Spanberger raised this quarter is the highest amount ever raised in the second quarter of a Virginia gubernatorial election year, according to her campaign. Her dominance helped her secure the Democratic nomination unopposed and build what now appears to be a commanding early lead.
Earle-Sears, meanwhile, has now broken Republican gubernatorial fundraising records in back-to-back quarters. She raised $3.52 million from April 1 to June 5, and another $2.39 million between June 5 and June 30 — the strongest second-quarter total ever reported by a Virginia GOP candidate for governor.
“This kind of grassroots energy is historic — not just for our campaign, but for the future of Virginia,” Earle-Sears said in a statement. “Virginians are ready to Axe the Tax, protect Right-to-Work, and deliver bold, common-sense leadership that puts working families first.”
Her campaign plans to use the funds to scale up field operations, launch advertising across the state, and mobilize what it called “the broadest grassroots coalition in Virginia politics today.”
“No one in this race matches Winsome’s story, her proven record of results, or this kind of support from everyday Virginians,” said campaign spokesperson Peyton Vogel. “She’s the proven winner — and Virginians are ready to make history with her again.”
Spanberger isn’t the only Democrat leading both in dollars and public opinion. 
State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, holds a staggering financial advantage in the race for lieutenant governor. Her campaign has raised $3.47 million this cycle, with $1.28 million cash on hand, compared to Republican nominee John Reid’s $440,809 raised and just $163,082 in the bank.
Hashmi raised $2.4 million during the second quarter alone — more than twice the highest amount previously raised by any Virginia lieutenant governor candidate during an election-year Q2, her campaign said.
The latest VCU poll also shows Hashmi leading Reid 46% to 36%, mirroring the double-digit lead at the top of the ticket.
The lone Republican bright spot in fundraising is Attorney General Jason Miyares, who is running for reelection. Miyares has raised $9.37 million this cycle and has nearly $7 million cash on hand. In contrast, Democratic challenger Jay Jones has brought in $4.9 million and reports $1.24 million on hand.
Miyares raised $4.7 million in just the past 30 days, far outpacing other candidates down-ballot.
National Democrats pour $1M into Jay Jones’ bid to flip Virginia AG seat

Still, the VCU poll gives Jones a narrow lead: 47% to 38%.
Political scientist Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington said the new fundraising and polling numbers paint a clear picture of where each party is focusing its energy — and where the GOP may be shifting its bets.
“These numbers suggest Republicans are looking at this election season through the lens of triage,” Farnsworth said, “and imagining their money can most effectively be spent on the attorney general rather than the other candidates on the ticket.”
He added, “The results so far speak to a Republican vote of little confidence in the ticket this year. Spanberger’s numbers, in contrast, speak to a Democratic optimism for 2025.”
Farnsworth noted that Republicans had previously argued the races would tighten after the General Assembly session and the nomination process ended, but “these numbers don’t reflect all that much of a change.”

Andy Barr for Senate reported more than $1.4 million in total receipts during the quarter to the Federal Election Commission this week, with a balance on hand of $6.1 million as of June 30.
Cameron reported only $385,600 in receipts for the quarter and $532,00 on hand.
A third major candidate, Nate Morris, a wealthy businessman who has never held public office and is already running television ads statewide, did not have to file a campaign finance report for the quarter because he did not register his campaign with the election commission until July 1.
Other candidates could join the race to win the May 2026 primary election to succeed U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell, the former Senate Republican leader who is serving his seventh term and announced early this year he would not seek reelection.

Banking, financial services PACS pony up for Barr
Barr’s campaign bragged of his massive fundraising lead in a press release late Tuesday that said in part, “This fundraising surge, powered by grassroots conservatives across Kentucky, proves we are the campaign best positioned with the momentum to win and deliver for Kentuckians.”
But Barr’s reports indicate his fundraising is mostly powered by his experience raising campaign cash during seven terms in Washington representing Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District and by his committee assignments. Barr is a senior member of the House Financial Services Committee and chair of its Financial Institutions and Monetary Policy Subcommittee. 
Political action committees representing banks and other financial services corporations and associations put up much of the $1,093,500 from traditional PACs that Barr’s campaign raised in the first six months of 2025.
During the same six months, Cameron reported raising just $1,000 from PACs.
Stephen Voss, an associate professor of political science at the University of Kentucky, said earlier this year that most experienced members of Congress, regardless of political affiliation, can expect a steady flow of donations from traditional PACs. “Andy Barr has been influential in the banking and finance sector for years now, and PACs tend to reward longterm relationships,” Voss said.
Traditional PACs — organizations representing corporations, associations, labor unions, political organizations and other groups  — are limited by law to giving no more than $5,000 per election. The limit is effectively $10,000 because a PAC can give $5,000 designated to a candidate’s primary election and $5,000 designated to the general election.
Barr’s campaign committee also got a headstart over Cameron because he was able to roll over nearly $3.7 million from the committee that raised money for his U.S. House elections to his Senate campaign. And about 40% of that money was originally contributed to Barr by PACs.
Moreover, his campaign fund has received more than $815,000 in transfers from a different Barr political committee called Friends of Andy Barr, which is a so-called joint fundraising committee that raises money for Barr-related political committees — and part of that money comes from PACs
Too early to write off Cameron; Barr’s fundraising just ‘astonishingly high’
The Kentucky Lantern asked Barr’s campaign via email whether PAC contributions are the major reason for Barr’s fundraising momentum. The campaign responded with a statement saying in part, “Our momentum is fueled by dozens of major endorsements from federal, state, local, and grassroots leaders. We have $6.1 million on hand, while one opponent has $532K …”
Cameron’s campaign did not immediately reply to an email from the Lantern.
Voss, the political scientist, said Wednesday it’s too early to write Cameron off based on a single quarter’s fundraising. “It is false to suggest that these numbers indicate Cameron is in trouble … or that he lacks the resources to mount a serious campaign for United States Senate.”
The campaign is still in its early phase and that the amount raised to date by Cameron is not unusually low, Voss said.
“It’s not that Cameron’s fundraising has been weak. It hasn’t. It’s that Barr ‘s has been astonishingly high,” Voss said.

Cameron holds high name recognition across Kentucky because of his successful 2019 campaign for Kentucky attorney general, his four years serving in that job, and his competitive race against Democrat Andy Beshear for governor in 2023.
Earlier this year his campaign released a poll showing him with a lead in the race for the GOP Senate nomination.
The candidate who wins Republican President Donald Trump’s endorsement — if he makes one in this race — is expected to have a huge advantage. Each of the three candidates is claiming to be Trump’s strongest supporter and the most capable of helping implement Trump’s agenda. 
Kentucky House Democratic Floor Leader Pamela Stevenson, the only Kentucky Democrat who has announced for U.S. Senate, reported raising $150,000 during the quarter and had almost $49,000 on hand as of June 30.

According to a statement from state Sen. John Cherry (D-Flint), the Sandisk Corporation announced Wednesday that they were scrapping plans to move forward with their planned manufacturing effort in Mundy Township. 
Cherry called the decision “deeply disappointing,” saying the project represented a generational opportunity to restore Genesee County’s as a manufacturing powerhouse. 
He also slammed the Trump administration’s tariff policies as the driver behind the decision, arguing the president’s levies policies have disrupted supply chains and created instability for investors, making it difficult for even the most promising projects to move forward.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“While this pause is a setback, it does not erase the progress we’ve made or the potential that still exists within the Advanced Manufacturing District of Genesee County. We remain committed to attracting transformative investments, supporting skilled trades  and technical careers, and ensuring that Genesee County remains a competitive and compelling destination for advanced manufacturing,” Cherry said. 
However, Michigan Speaker of the House Matt Hall (R-Richland Township) argued the president’s tariffs aren’t to blame and are aimed at punishing companies for offshoring jobs while rewarding companies who build and invest in America. 

“President Trump’s bold leadership is making it easier and more attractive than ever to create jobs in America. We simply need state leaders who are focused on making sure Michigan is the best possible place to build and grow,” Hall said. “That’s why House Republicans will continue to fight at the Capitol to cut unnecessary red tape, reverse the 2023 Democrat tax hike on small business and improve state government services to help as many job creators as possible choose Michigan as a permanent home.”
In April, the University of Pennsylvania’s Penn Wharton Budget Model predicted Trump’s tariffs would reduce the nation’s gross domestic product by 6% in the long run with wages seeing a 5% reduction. According to the model, a middle-income household will see a $22K lifetime loss.

A California-based company set to utilize a Genesee County megasite for a massive semiconductor project has reportedly dropped the effort citing “massive uncertainty” at the federal level.
Michigan Gov. Whitmer in a Wednesday statement said that a company whose preferred site was located in Mundy Township decided against building a semiconductor plant anywhere in the U.S.
“Their board came to this decision amid national economic turmoil, which is at risk of worsening amid threats of even higher tariffs,” Whitmer said. 
State Sen. John Cherry (D-Flint), later identified the company in a statement as Sandisk Corporation.

U.S. Rep. Kristen McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City) – whose 8th Congressional District includes all of Saginaw and Bay counties, almost all of Genesee County and parts of Midland and Tuscola counties – slammed the Trump administration, arguing the project would have brought thousands of jobs to the region.
“This is a gut punch to working families across our region. Trump’s abandonment of long-term investments and chaotic tariff practices are not only raising costs, they just killed 10,000 good-paying jobs,” McDonald Rivet said in a statement. “This could have been a game-changer for mid-Michigan’s economy. We need practical solutions, not chaos and dysfunction that cost us once-in-a-generation opportunities.”

Additionally, the Flint & Genesee Economic Alliance said while they were disappointed by the announcement, they remained 100% committed to attracting an advanced manufacturer to Genesee County.
“The Advanced Manufacturing District of Genesee County is the best site in North America for an advanced manufacturer to locate, and we will continue our important work together to attract a job-creating project that will benefit our region and the entire state for generations to come. We remain convinced that attracting an advanced manufacturer will create thousands of jobs, help boost and launch small businesses, create opportunities for young people and help us enhance national security by bringing our supply chain and jobs back to the U.S.,” Tyler Rossmaessler, executive director of the agency, said
During her keynote address at the 2025 Mackinac Policy Conference, Whitmer set her sights on securing a semiconductor plant and beginning construction by the end of 2026.
“We will continue to compete with other states and countries to bring cutting-edge factories home to Michigan so we can create economic prosperity for workers and communities and lead the next century of advanced manufacturing,” Whitmer said on Wednesday. “While I will keep doing whatever is in my power to build on Michigan’s economic momentum, there is no doubt that national economic uncertainty will make this harder. We will keep bringing people together to get big things done.”
Quentin Messer, CEO of the Michigan Economic Development Corporation said the state’s team can, with confidence say it presented the most compelling site, the most competitive business case and the strongest community impact partnership in the U.S.
“While economic factors outside of the state’s control ultimately proved insurmountable to this greenfield project moving forward in the U.S., we are proud of the tremendous work that resulted in Genesee County being the preferred, and final U.S. location for what would have been a generational semiconductor fab investment,” Messer said. 
The Economic Development Corporation remains on track in its site readiness efforts in Mundy Township, Messer said, with the Flint and Genesee Economic Alliance leading investment and work into making it a premier greenfield site. 
“That momentum remains strong and will continue onward, putting Genesee County in a dynamic position to secure future advanced manufacturing investments that will bring good paying jobs and economic opportunity to our state,” Messer said.

(Photo by Lauren McCauley/ Maine Morning Star)After investigating the recent accusation of multiple Maine citizens voting twice in the same election, the Secretary of State’s office has said it found the claims to be false. 
In a letter to the chair of the Maine Republican Party, Secretary of State Shenna Bellows said the Elections Division in her office found no incidents of dual voting among the list of 51 names accused by the party of voting twice in the same election. 
The investigation from Bellows’ office comes after the Maine GOP released the results of an election integrity investigation it conducted this year that focused on voters who were registered to vote twice. The state party, along with the help of the RNC, found more than 600 voters who registered to vote twice and more than 50 who voted twice in the same election, using an official state voter file provided by the Secretary of State, according to details shared in a June 26 Facebook post. 
Of the 51 names in question, 11 were different people with the same name and another 19 were erroneously recorded by their local municipality as having voted twice but in fact had not, according to a news release from Bellows’ office Wednesday morning. 
The rest of the voters’ records needed minor corrections or other administrative action, but had no record of dual voting. For example, there was an individual accused who voted in the municipal and state elections in June 2024, which are technically separate elections even when held on the same day. 
Bellows said anyone with concerns or evidence of improper voting should bring those to the Department of Secretary of State to investigate in accordance with the Constitution. She went on to say that “it’s not only unfair to the individuals wrongly accused but also an insult to the hardworking state and local election officials to make false accusations of criminal activity.”
The Maine GOP did not respond to a request for comment on Bellows’ letter as of mid-Wednesday. 
The June accusations came less than a year after accusations of non-citizen voting across the country from Republican lawmakers and candidates before the November 2024 election. State lawmakers in Maine joined the chorus after a conservative news outlet published an article alleging six noncitizens are registered to vote in Maine by comparing voter rolls against self-reported status on medical records, which the website refused to turn over to the state’s constitutional officers.
Bellows said at the time that she was committed to investigating the potential violations, but worried that the largely unsubstantiated claims will be used to sow doubt in the upcoming election results.
Election officials in Maine inspect voter rolls after every election to identify duplicates or any potential wrongdoings, the release said. After the 2020 election, two individuals were identified during that process as having voted twice and were prosecuted by the Maine Office of Attorney General. 
Routine election work also includes the review of duplicate registrations, which are not uncommon, especially after someone moves to a new municipality. The Secretary of State provides an annual report to the Maine Legislature outlining the cancellation of duplicates and other voter list maintenance. 
The 2024 report was delivered to the Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee in January. It indicated that nearly 1,200 duplicate records were removed from the statewide voter registration database. 
Duplicate records are resolved by Elections Division staff at the Secretary of State’s office — rather than municipal clerks who can only access their towns records — to ensure uniformity across the state, the release said. 
“We are proud of Maine’s safe, free, and secure elections, and I applaud the detailed work that Maine election officials do to ensure the integrity of our voter rolls and protect Maine elections,” Bellow said in the letter.

Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks officials announced that beginning July 16, hoot-owl restrictions would take effect beginning at 2 p.m on the Lower Bitterroot River. Under the restrictions, fishing is prohibited from 2 p.m. to midnight each day on the river from Veteran’s Bridge in Hamilton to the confluence with the Clark Fork River.
The Upper Bitterroot has been under similar restrictions since July 11.
According to FWP’s list of waterway closures, there are currently 11 rivers under hoot-owl restrictions due to warm water conditions detrimental to native fish populations.
On the Lower Bitterroot, water temperatures measured near Missoula exceeded 73 degrees for three consecutive days starting on July 11.
Water temperatures of 77 degrees or more can be lethal to trout.


The restrictions are designed to protect fish that become more susceptible to disease and mortality when water temperatures warm. Restricting angling to only cool morning hours can help reduce catch-and-release mortality.


Anglers can reduce stress on fish by getting them to the net or in hand quickly, keeping them in the water and reviving them prior to releasing them back into the river.

As the summer warms, Montana offers many other angling options with better conditions for fish, including larger lakes or reservoirs, or higher elevation lakes and streams.
Officials with Yellowstone National Park announced that over the weekend, stringent fishing restrictions took effect on three rivers inside park boundaries due to warm temperatures and low stream flows.
The Madison, Firehole and Gibbon River, and all associated tributaries, are completely closed to anglers at this time.

All fishing restrictions remain in effect until conditions improve.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/8426057273_4e72b57be7_o-1024x689.jpg,,,2025-07-16 13:24:46.648833

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.

A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.










There isn't a single app out there that's going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That's just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.

Arkansas’ example

Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”

Other state efforts

Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

“In the same way that Detroit is shorthand for auto manufacturing and Hollywood is shorthand for filmmaking, New Orleans was, for generations, known essentially as the place one went to buy African American people.” — Calvin Schermerhorn, historian, Arizona State University, “‘As I Have Seen and Known It,’ Ex-Slave Autobiographers and the New Orleans Slave Market” from “New Orleans: A Literary History”

The following is an account of what it was like for some of those enslaved people to make the weeks-long journey by ship from the mid-Atlantic states to be sold in the New Orleans slave market of the 1840s. Thousands of others were forced to march to the city over hundreds of miles of primitive roads and trails. The events described here are based on historical documents and the first-hand accounts of the enslaved people themselves, including narratives from Henry Bibb, John Brown, William Wells Brown, Josiah Henson, and Solomon Northup.
Spring arrived late in 1841. Mid-April storms dumped more than a foot of snow from Philadelphia to New York City, 2 feet in parts of New Jersey and 18 inches in parts of Massachusetts.
William Henry Harrison, the nation’s ninth president, had died on April 4 from what doctors at the time believed was pneumonia he contracted while delivering his 1 hour and 45-minute inaugural speech — still the longest on record — without a coat or hat on a cold, damp Washington, D.C., March 4 morning. He was just one month into his term.
Faced with the first death of a president in office and a vagueness in the Constitution, official Washington was scrambling to understand what that meant for the nation’s leadership. Was Vice President John Tyler to serve the rest of Harrison’s term or only until a new election could be held? Did he become president, acting president, or remain vice president?
The constitutional crisis and presidential funeral were not likely top-of-mind for the crew steering a steamboat down the Potomac River, ringing its bell as it passed George Washington’s tomb at Mount Vernon to honor Harrison’s first predecessor. The ship’s business was commerce, moving the barrels and boxes of freight in the steamer’s hold to points of transfer and sale downriver.
Like hundreds of other steamers in the previous and coming decades, it also carried a group of men, women, and children shackled and secured for transport in the damp darkness below deck, part of the interstate slave trade that had grown steadily since the U.S. Congress banned the trans-Atlantic trafficking of enslaved people in 1808.
The flow of captives from the Mid-Atlantic and Upper South — by waterway or through lands seized from Indigenous nations forcibly removed in the brutal Trail of Tears from 1830 to 1850 — to markets and plantations in the Deep South or expanding settlements in the West was a major cog in the nation’s economy. And likely no city benefited more from this cruel economic exchange than New Orleans.

The ship making its way down the Potomac would become noteworthy only because one of the captive migrants onboard was a man named Solomon Northup. His memoir, “Twelve Years a Slave,” would reveal intimate details of the horrors and cruelty of the slave trade in a dramatically personal way. Northup’s harsh treatment under a cruel Louisiana slave holder paralleled Harriet Beecher Stowe’s fictional “Uncle Tom’s Cabin,” which became the best-selling U.S. novel of the 19th century, boosting the abolitionist movement, enraging Southern slaveholders, and pushing the nation closer to civil war.

Northup’s story also provides real-life insight into what it meant to be sold through the New Orleans slave market from the point of view of the enslaved person.
A Black man born free in Saratoga Springs, New York, Northup has been lured to Washington, D.C., drugged and kidnapped into slavery. In an apparent attempt to hide that crime, he is listed on the manifest of the ship that takes him to New Orleans as Plat Hamilton.
During his journey and his years in slavery, Northup sees families being torn apart, fellow captives beaten and broken, and traders and enslavers enforcing their wills without empathy or conscience while never losing hope that he will eventually be freed and returned to his family.
Initially, Northup formed a close bond with another captive. Number 38 on the manifest’s list, her name is Eliza, but she was listed as “Drady Cooper,” aged 22, and five feet five inches tall. She was being taken south with her two children, Randall and Emily. Randall is about 10 years old, and Emily is 7.
The family had been sold to James H. Birch, a well-known slave trader who had been operating in Richmond, Virginia, since the 1830s. He was among the most visible and frequent advertisers for buying and selling people in the Chesapeake, Virginia, newspapers, sometimes even running the same advertisement for buying groups of enslaved people every day for months.

Like many young women exploited in slavery, Eliza was used sexually by the man who owned her. When the man married, his new wife despised and mistreated Eliza. The man deceived Eliza into thinking he would free her and the children, but instead sold her, Randall, and his own daughter, Emily, to Birch.
Typical of the often complex travel routes, Northup, Eliza, and the other captives are transferred from the ship to stagecoaches for the leg to Fredericksburg, Virginia, where they are forced to board railcars for the 60-mile journey to Richmond. The use of rail lines, with the ongoing national improvements to roads, bridges, and other infrastructure, helped to make it easier for enslavers to move their captives more cheaply by bypassing coastal and overland routes, another example of how the nation’s expansion fueled the slave trade.
Northup and the others are held in a slave pen between a railroad depot and the James River. Now far from the homes they have known and uncertain of the future, Northup observes Eliza sitting in a corner, singing hymns and praying for her children.

The captives are marched through the streets of Richmond the next day. Slave coffles were a common sight in port cities along the route. The group is herded to a two-masted sailing ship, the brig named Orleans, rigged and loaded with tobacco. The Baltimore-built ship, a regular slaver, holds the equivalent of about two semi-trailers worth of cargo today.
The Orleans’ master, and the man who signed the pre-printed “Manifest of Slaves” along with ship owner Luther Libby and customs collector Thomas Nelson, is William Wickham.

About 40 enslaved men and women, carrying rolled-up blankets, tin cups, and spoons, walk on board the Orleans around 5 p.m. on April 27, 1841.
The brig sails down the James River, into the Chesapeake Bay, and arrives in Norfolk, Virginia, where four more enslaved people are brought aboard.
After a night in the cargo hold, the captives are allowed to remain on deck, uncuffed during the day, as the ship sails southward. They are fed fried cornmeal cake and bacon twice a day, at 10 a.m. and 5 p.m., and forced back into the hold after dark. The hatch is barred shut.
The trips from the Upper South to New Orleans were not as long or as dangerous as the brutal trans-Atlantic voyages in which 12 million captives were hauled from Africa to the Americas from the 16th to the 19th centuries.
But there were still perils along the way. A violent storm strikes just after the Orleans loses sight of land as it heads down the coastline, pushing the ship off course. When the brig makes it to calmer waters, the captives discuss whether they should try to take the Orleans by force and make way for freedom in New York. Just a month before, the U.S. Supreme Court had ruled that enslaved Africans who had successfully rebelled and taken control of the Spanish schooner La Amistad were free to return to their homeland.

But the plan aboard the Orleans comes to nothing after one of the conspirators contracts smallpox and dies four days before their arrival in New Orleans. Like the thousands who died in the Middle Passage of the trans-Atlantic trade, his body was dumped into the sea.
Only five months later, the slave ship Creole, traveling on the same route from Richmond to New Orleans, was taken over in a rebellion by the 128 enslaved Africans aboard and diverted to Nassau, Bahamas, where their freedom was granted under the sovereignty of Great Britain, which had abolished slavery in 1833. Freedom for Northup, Eliza and the others had been that close.
The brig docks in New Orleans on May 23, 1841. As was common practice, slave traders and consignees came aboard. Although well-known for its large and busy auction houses, the sale of captives can happen almost anywhere in New Orleans — the docks, slave pens, private homes, and coffee shops. Due to the threat of yellow fever and malaria during the hot summer months, the local slave selling season traditionally runs from January through late March. The Chesapeake sellers hope for higher prices with less competition.
The men and women of the Orleans sit handcuffed at the dock. There is a roll call of first names: “Stand up when you hear your name.”
Theophilus Freeman, Birch’s business partner and one of the most infamous slave traders in the nation, calls for “Plat.” When no one answers, he points to Northup as matching the description: 26 years old, 5 feet, 7 inches tall, “yellow” coloring.

Freeman, who has a thin face and bent posture, makes his money running a multi-state slave-trading network, a business he has been in since the late 1830s. He works freelance or under contract to collect enslaved people from the Upper South and transport them to the lower Mississippi River valley.
The ironically named Freeman (in Greek, Theophilus means God lover) will be listed in the 1842 New Orleans city directory with the occupation “trader,” and is considered by many in the city a man of ill repute, not because he was selling human beings but because he was often accused of shady business dealing and was notably violent to his captives. One of the wealthiest men in the country, in about 19 years he will die in poverty in New Orleans, on the run after having been accused of stealing enslaved people and defrauding creditors.

A chain gang works on the levee as the enslaved people from the Orleans are marched to Freeman’s slave pen at the corner of Esplanade Avenue and Chartres Street. Many such groups of captives are at work around the city, building canals, levees, and other infrastructure. Much of the commerce — the many banks, the markets, the produce exchanges — is tightly woven into the web of the slave trade.
Freeman’s operation is adjacent to several other similar slave pens and is surrounded by a variety of professional and retail businesses: doctors, accountants, carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors along with clothing, furniture, and jewelry stores.
The pen takes up about an acre, consisting of a block of houses forming a graveled square littered with trash and stones. Its yard is surrounded by upright planks with sharpened ends. Northup is put in with a group of about 50.

Slave pens generally have a “flogging room,” where punishment takes place. Facing the prospect of a new lifetime under malevolent owners and brutal working conditions on the sugar and cotton plantations, the captives are not always eager to comply. Cutting the skin by lash or bruising in conspicuous places on the body is avoided so as not to lower the slave sale price.
Punishment tools include hickory “flogging paddles” with holes drilled in them and “flops,” 1½-foot-long leather straps with wooden handles. Those who resist or don’t comply quickly enough  — men, women, and children — are stripped naked and beaten for up to half an hour while they lie face down, their hands tied by rope to cleats attached to the floor and their feet usually held down by another enslaved person forced to cooperate.
Eliza and the others leave their blankets in a small building, are fed, and then allowed to roam the pen until nightfall. They sleep under a shed, in a loft, or out in the open yard. The women and children are given separate rooms.
The next day, Freeman wakes his “stock,” as the slave merchants call them, by kicking some and by cracking his whip at others, getting the captives ready for sale. They wash thoroughly with greasy dishwater — perhaps to bring a glisten to the skin — and the men comb their hair and shave. Gray hairs are plucked or dyed. The appearance of robust health, youthfulness, and “looking smart” is vital for the best price.
They are assigned grades, depending on their prospective usefulness as farmhands or some other less taxing job. Their skin color is painstakingly and dehumanizingly recorded: dark, brown, griff, mulatto, yellow, etc., etc.

The men are given hats, coats, shirts, pants, and shoes. They are cheap but clean. The women get calico dresses and kerchiefs for their heads.
The best of the “stock” will be sold in the slave pen; the others will be taken to various coffee houses, exchanges, and other auction locations scattered around the city.
Unlike the city of Richmond, where the multimillion-dollar slave-trade business largely takes place in undesirable parts of the city, New Orleans sales often take center stage at venues such as the St. Louis Exchange Hotel and the St. Charles Hotel.
The most famous of these is the St. Louis, on the corner of what is now Chartres and St. Louis streets. The auctioning of human beings takes place under a 100-ton copper-plated dome “every day except the Sabbath.” Bidders sit at a massive bar under 19-foot ceilings, sipping drinks from French glasses and watching the auctions.
Things are much less elegant back at the Esplanade pen, where Freeman is the stern and threatening director of a theatrical pre-sale rehearsal. The trader orders men to one side of the room and women to the other, arranged by height, with young Emily at the end of the line.

Freeman, carrying his ever-present whip, cajoles the captives to look alert and happy, sometimes threatening and sometimes promising favors. They are forced to parade and dance. Northup, an experienced musician, plays the fiddle as if he were entertaining at a Virginia reel barn dance. But the music and the marching mask the dark underbelly of cruelty and terror.
“Look smart!” “Be bright!” “Stay spry!” “Stand here!” “Dance!” “Hold your head up!” Freeman commands his captives.

Customers arrive to examine them, feeling their hands, arms, and bodies. They open their mouths and inspect their teeth as if they are buying a horse. Some are taken out back, stripped, and inspected more thoroughly, often sexually assaulted. Those with scars on their bodies are harder to sell, the marks on their backs suggesting they could be “rebellious.”
The buying commences at 10 a.m. and continues until 1 p.m. The enslaved people are fed, and the afternoon sale goes from 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. Those not sold are returned for another night in the slave pen.
Eliza cries as her son, Randall, is purchased by a Baton Rouge planter, who makes the child jump, run across the floor, and perform other activities before completing the deal. Despite being threatened with 100 lashes by Freeman, she begs the man not to separate her family, to take her and Emily as well.

“I love my boy!” she cries over and over again. “I’ll be faithful! I’ll obey! I’ll work day and night until I die!”
But the planter explains that he can’t afford to buy her, times being what they are. Randall will be his only purchase.
Eliza runs to the boy, hugs and kisses him, her tears streaming as Freeman again threatens to “give her something to cry about.”
“Don’t cry, mama. I will be a good boy. Don’t cry,” Randall tells his mother as he is led out the door by the man from Baton Rouge. His ultimate fate is unknown.
Almost all of those who traveled aboard the Orleans fell sick that night, complaining of back pain and violent headaches. A doctor confirms they, like the unfortunate man earlier in the forced journey, have contracted smallpox. They are taken to a hospital, not out of compassion but to guard the bottom line. Northup goes temporarily blind. The doctor wonders if he’ll recover.
After about two weeks, Northup and Eliza are better and are returned to Freeman’s slave pen. Again, they are paraded. Again, they are inspected and examined. Again, they are forced to grin and dance.
A middle-aged man arrives a few days later, in late June. He acts friendly and cheerful, asking the enslaved men and women questions about their skills and the types of jobs they are accustomed to. “Would you like to come live with me? Will you be good boys?” he asks.
Freeman offers to sell Northup for $1,000, and Eliza for $700. The man accepts the offer.
Eliza breaks down when she realizes she will be torn from her remaining child, Emily. She clings to her daughter, and Freeman roughly grabs her arm, cursing and hitting her while she staggers back.
“Mercy, mercy, master!” Eliza cries. “Please, master, buy Emily. I can never work if she is taken from me: I will die.”
The man, William Ford, a Baptist preacher who has a plantation along the Red River in what was known as the Great Pine Woods, seems to take pity and offers to buy Emily as well for a “reasonable” price.
But Freeman, a pimp as well as a trader, is having none of it. There are buyers who would pay $5,000 for the light-skinned Emily when she gets a little older, he argues. The sale of young women to work in brothels or to provide sexual services to their owners can be lucrative for the seller.
“There were heaps and piles of money to be made for such an extra fancy piece as Emily would be,” Freeman pronounced in the crudest terms, according to Northup. “She was a beauty — a picture — a doll — one of your regular bloods — none of your thick-lipped, bullet-headed, cotton [pickers].”
Eliza shrieks. “I will not go without her! They shall not take her from me!”
But Freeman tears Emily away from her mother as the child cries for Eliza not to leave her. “Come back — don’t leave me — come back, mama!”
But Eliza, renamed Drady, and Northup are forced to leave with their new owner, boarding a steamer named the Rodolph to travel upriver.
Eliza never sees her children again.
She is overcome by loss and grief, and can’t do the grueling work in the cotton field. Eliza, who has become thin and haggard, is ultimately sold again to a new owner, who beats her mercilessly to force her to work.
Uncared for and unable to overcome the unimaginable burdens placed upon her by the institution of slavery, she soon dies in a dilapidated cabin in Louisiana, far from home and with no family to comfort her.
Thousands of more enslaved men, women and children would experience the same cruel journey from the mid-Atlantic and Upper South to New Orleans over the next 20 years until the evil slave trade is finally brought to an end with the Civil War.

(Austin Anthony for the Kentucky Lantern)In the race for money in Kentucky’s 6th Congressional District, former Kentucky House Democratic caucus chair Cherlynn Stevenson has gained the lead. 
Stevenson surpasses the candidates who have announced so far in cash, with a campaign total of more than $210,000 in two months. That’s all from contributions. Stevenson has not loaned her campaign any money. 
Congressional candidates were required to submit finance reports for activities for April through June with the Federal Election Commission by Tuesday. The primary election for the seat is in May. The incumbent, U.S. Rep. Andy Barr, is running for U.S. Senate in 2026. 
Stevenson’s donors include several elected Kentucky Democrats, including state lawmakers Sen. Reggie Thomas, Rep. Erika Hancock and Rep. Adrielle Camuel. Former state lawmakers Rep. Angie Hatton and Rep. Rachel Roberts also contributed to Stevenson’s campaign. 
Stevenson received a donation from the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers PAC this quarter of $5,000.
“As this first round of fundraising reports shows, Cherlynn has real momentum right off the bat and is in a strong position headed into this next quarter,” Jason Perkey, Stevenson’s campaign manager, said in a statement. “We’re not taking anything for granted — we have our foot on the gas, and we’re not letting up.”
  David Kloiber (David Kloiber campaign)
Stevenson’s campaign said 77% of the donations were $25 or less, and most of its donations were from Kentuckians. Donations came from more than half of Kentucky’s 120 counties, including all the counties in the 6th Congressional District, the campaign said. 
Stevenson has raised more than any Democratic candidate in their first quarter in the congressional district within the last decade, her campaign added, including former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath in 2018 and Josh Hicks, a Marine veteran and local attorney, in 2020.
The campaign of David Kloiber, another Democrat vying for the seat, reported to the FEC that he has a total of $138,795 for the quarter. That includes $97,000 in self-loans from the candidate and about $42,000 in contributions. Kloiber is a former Lexington council member and announced his campaign in June. 
On the GOP side, Winchester state Rep. Ryan Dotson has garnered about $96,000 since getting into the race. 
According to Dotson’s filing with the FEC, he received some support from two political action committees — $2,000 from the Louisville Apartment
Association PAC and $5,000 from the National Apartment Association PAC. He raised more than $35,000 in contributions. Dotson loaned his campaign $60,000.
In a phone interview with the Kentucky Lantern, Dotson called from Washington, D.C, Wednesday afternoon, where he has met with advisers to President Donald Trump, U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson’s political team, U.S. House GOP Whip Tom Emmer’s team and more Republican politicos. 
Dotson’s campaign formally kicked off in June, which is when he began fundraising, he said.

“We’re on track to do really, really well, but we started off fundraising right at the end of the quarter. So, we have several fundraisers scheduled,” Dotson said. “We have several donors, different groups of donors, that will be giving pockets of money.”
As for his meetings in the Capital, Dotson said he’s “established some great relationships” and get more insight on his campaign. 
“I’m very engaged when it comes to my stance on conservative issues,” Dotson said. “So, I will be up here pushing back against the woke agenda. I’ll be up here pushing back on things that I feel are detrimental to our nation and our families. A lot of that stuff does stir me up, and I’ve done it on the House floor in Frankfort, but I want to be able to come and do it here in Washington, D.C., as well.”
Richmond Republican state Rep. Deanna Gordon announced her campaign after the reporting quarter ended, so her campaign did not have to file financial reports this time. 
Dr. Ralph Alvarado, the 2019 running mate of former Republican Gov. Matt Bevin, said in a social media post last week that he is considering a run for the seat. Alvarado had been serving as the commissioner of the Tennessee Department of Health but recently stepped down from the position. He is also a former Kentucky state senator.

The Legal Services Corporation focused its Tuesday forum on efforts to expand legal services in Michigan, with a particular emphasis on local housing initiatives including eviction diversion efforts.
Legal Services Board Chair John G. Levi opened the forum by emphasizing the critical role civil legal aid plays in housing matters, noting that a good lawyer can mean the difference between eviction or somebody keeping their home. 
Since the corporation was founded by Congress in 1974, it has helped provide legal services to nearly 75 million low income Americans, Levi said, continuing to offer services to 5 million individuals yearly including more than a million children, more than 200,000 survivors of domestic violence and nearly 45,000 veterans.

When it comes to matters of housing, Levi noted that individuals with an attorney had a 90% chance of receiving a favorable outcome, while those without had a 90% chance of being evicted. 
The continuous underfunding of the corporation has only fueled the lack of access to counsel, Levi noted, while pointing to a recent study they’d released showing that civil legal aid yields an average positive return of $7 for every $1 invested. 
“That’s because civil legal aid prevents and solves legal problems before they lead to even more costly public expenditures on things like emergency medical care, law enforcement and shelters,” Levi said. 
In one of the opening speeches to the forum, former Michigan Supreme Court Chief Justice Elizabeth Clement, who now serves as the president and CEO of the National Center for State Courts, emphasized that access to justice is a mandate of democracy. 

“Everyone, regardless of income, background or circumstance, must be able to come to court and be heard. Yet we know that for too many that remains out of reach and that must change,” Clement said. 
These efforts will not only take policy change, but cultural change, Clement said, later sharing her vision of transforming the court experience for individuals facing poverty and other societal barriers. 

“We need to support civil diversion programs and partnership with legal service providers giving people time, resources and space to resolve disputes thoughtfully,” Clement said. “We need to maintain remote and hybrid options to remove transportation barriers and enable full participation in our justice system. We need to see continuous community feedback to improve services and ensure accountability.”

She pointed to National Center for State Courts eviction diversion initiatives in Grand Rapids and Lansing as examples of how courts are reimagining ways to resolve housing disputes. 
“In Grand Rapids, the eviction diversion team has organized job fairs, expedited rental assistance and offered housing navigation services. In Lansing, the diversion facilitator has built a growing network of partners that provide tenants with financial counseling, job training and even free computers and school supplies,” Clement said. 
Following Clement’s remarks the corporation hosted a panel examining eviction diversion efforts in Michigan, featuring Pamela Hoekwater,  the executive director of Legal Aid of Western Michigan; Jessica Maas, managing attorney of Michigan Advocacy Program’s Lansing office; Ulices Rosa, the eviction diversion facilitator at Michigan’s 54-A District Court; and Ryan VanderMeer, a co-founder of Urban Pharm property management firm.
In her 18 years of practice before becoming executive director, Hoekwater explained that eviction hearings were often cattle calls, with individuals given 60 seconds to come up with a defense that would earn them a trial, or if unsuccessful, they would be given a judgment with 10 days to get out if they could not pay their judgment.

Generally speaking, eviction cases in Michigan move very quickly, Maas said, with the first court date scheduled within 10 days of a case being filed. 
As a result, tenants often show up without a lawyer having only recently discovered they have a court date that week, Maas said. 
“They’re often, I think, focused more on the logistics of that, like do I need to miss work? Do I need to get daycare? That sort of thing,” Maas said. 
Additionally, tenants are also often uninformed and misinformed about the rights and obligations of both tenants and landlords, Maas said. 
“For example, people ask us, am I being evicted today? Do I have to get out today? Conversely, they may think that they have months to get out. Another example is that they may think that if their landlord needs to make repairs to their place, that they don’t have to pay anything at all. The other side of that is that there are many tenants who believe that their landlord doesn’t have to make repairs if they haven’t paid in full,” Maas said.

As a result one of the benefits of their eviction diversion program is the ability to give those individuals the correct information about their case and offer them the best solution or a series of solutions to choose with an informed perspective, Maas said. 
While he can’t speak for all landlords, VanderMeer said landlords often do not want an eviction either, noting that the true cost includes four to six months of lost rent alongside the cost of repairs and legal fees. 
Though there are evictions that happen due to other reasons, most of the time evictions are about money, VanderMeer said. 
“If we can agree that it’s about money, we can collaborate and then figure out what to do from there,” he said. 
In Lansing, one of the first lessons Rosa said he learned in eviction diversion, was the need to meet every family no matter where they were in the process, whether they were coming from homelessness or about to be homeless. 
“I learned also that very first day that the program would only work if the foundation was relationships: the relationships to the families, the relationships to the landlords, the relationships to all the stakeholders, to [the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services] to everyone involved, legal services, anyone and everyone involved in helping people,” Rosa said. 
Alongside working in eviction diversion, Rosa said he’s transformed into a community liaison, helping to bridge services so people facing eviction can address areas within their lives so they do not find themselves in that situation again. 
COVID-era funding that’s prevented thousands of evictions is set to expire. What happens next?

“There’s a lot that can be done prior to the crisis. And so what I’ve done with our program is – and encouraged all the other courts to do so as well – is to proactively get resources out to the community,” Rosa said. “I’m one person, so I have to do it by email, which has now grown to a little over 1400 households that receive food, jobs, apartments, free training, financial training, children’s resources, senior resources, veterans resources and it’s proactively being sent to them.”
As far as best practices for landlords, VanderMeer said they should have a policy that is clear and consistent, and is communicated to tenants so they are not caught off guard. 
“Our process, this is best practice for us, is we wait 30 days after sending a notice to file, and we send, I don’t know, 50 eviction notices a month, and we probably file two eviction cases a month or something. And not that two is a great number, but 48 you know, what’s that? 96% resolved,” VanderMeer said. 
Additionally, Urban Pharm opts to have its hearings virtually, so that folks do not have to arrange for childcare or risk a default judgement due to a missed hearing. 
When moving through the hearing process, the biggest factor is keeping a judgment off someone’s record so they don’t have a problem finding housing elsewhere later down the road, VanderMeer said. 
Conditional dismissals are also a tool folks in legal aid can use, VanderMeer said, allowing landlords and tenants to go into a breakout room and negotiate terms that work for everybody. 
“Maybe it’s,’ I just need more time. I need the tax return to come in,’ or whatever it may be, and we can work that out.

(Screenshot from committee livestream)Nearly 6,000 students lacking permanent legal immigration status in Louisiana will lose access to federal financial aid for workforce education programs, creating funding gaps for the Louisiana Community and Technical College System. 
An estimated 5,700 students enrolled at Louisiana’s community and technical colleges will lose their support after President Donald Trump’s administration announced students without legal status to be in the United States would no longer qualify for student aid, LCTCS spokesman Chandler LeBoeuf said in a statement to the Illuminator. 
“Such support includes the loss of access to federally funded programs that help gain literacy, job skills and credentials,” LeBoeuf said. “We may face administrative burdens and funding gaps as we adjust enrollment policies.” 
The policy that allowed the immigrants to take advantage of student aid programs such as the Pell Grant and workforce training financial aid programs had been in place since 1997, when former President Bill Clinton’s administration exempted career, technical and adult education programs from provisions in law that limited federal benefits to just U.S. citizens, permanent residents and certain categories of “qualified aliens.” 
“The Department will ensure that taxpayer funds are reserved for citizens and individuals who have entered our country through legal means who meet federal eligibility criteria,” U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon said in a media release announcing the new policy.

The year-to-date number of cases in Mississippi ballooned to 80 as of July 10. That compares to 49 cases in all of 2024. 
No whooping cough deaths have been reported. Ten people have been hospitalized related to whooping cough, seven of whom were children under 2 months old who were too young to be vaccinated. 
Cases have largely been clustered in northeast Mississippi. The region accounts for 40% of cases statewide. 
The nation has also seen rising rates of whooping cough, though cases have been climbing less steeply than in Mississippi. About 15,000 whooping cough cases have been reported nationwide this year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The highly contagious respiratory illness is named for the “whooping” sound people make when gasping for air after a coughing fit. It may begin like a common cold but can last for weeks or months. Babies younger than 1 year are at greatest risk for getting whooping cough, and can have severe complications that often require hospitalization. 
Whooping cough cases fell in Mississippi after the COVID-19 pandemic began, but have since rebounded. This is likely due to people now taking fewer mitigation measures, like masking and remote learning, State Epidemiologist Renia Dotson said at the state Board of Health meeting July 9. 
The majority of cases – 76% – have occurred in children. Of the 73 cases reported in people who were old enough to be vaccinated, 28 were unvaccinated. Of those 28 people, 23 were children. 
“Vaccines are the best defense against vaccine preventable diseases,” State Health Officer Dr. Dan Edney said after the State Board of Health meeting.
Mississippi has long had the highest child vaccination rates in the country. But the state’s kindergarten vaccination rates have dropped since a federal judge ruled in 2023 that parents can opt out of vaccinating their children for school on account of religious beliefs. 
The pertussis vaccination is administered in a five-dose series for children under 7 and booster doses for older children and adults. The health department recommends that pregnant women, grandparents and family or friends that may come in close contact with an infant should get booster shots to ensure they do not pass the illness to children, particularly those too young to be vaccinated. 
Immunity from pertussis vaccination wanes over time, and there is not a routine recommendation for boosters. 
State health officials also encourage vaccination against other childhood illnesses, like measles. While Mississippi has not reported any measles cases, Texas has had recent outbreaks.

HILLSBOROUGH—About nine hours after Tropical Depression Chantal inundated central North Carolina last week, Jeff Mahagan’s phone woke him at 3:00 in the morning. The person working on call at the Hillsborough wastewater treatment plant was scared.
Mahagan, the town’s deputy utilities director for water treatment, didn’t immediately grasp the severity of the situation. He lives 20 miles away, where just three-tenths of an inch of rain had fallen.
Hillsborough was another story.
When Mahagan arrived at the plant, he tried to inspect the River Pumping Station perched 10 feet above the Eno River.
Oh my God, he thought to himself. The river had swallowed the pumping station and was within 2 feet of the roof.
It was exactly the scenario town officials had worried they might one day face.
And it’s unlikely the damage would have happened—at least to this extent—had the Federal Emergency Management Agency kept its word.
Three and a half years ago, Hillsborough applied for a FEMA grant as part of the agency’s Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, also known as BRIC, to protect its water and sewer systems from future weather disasters.
It took more than a year and a half for FEMA to approve the grant, slower than the agency had predicted. This spring town officials were preparing to request bids for the water project when FEMA abruptly announced in a press release that it had canceled the program, part of the Trump administration’s move to overhaul and substantially cut the agency.
The afternoon before the North Carolina flooding, meteorologists had forecast some areas could get 4 inches of rain and issued a flood watch. Midday on July 6, the U.S. Geological Survey’s in-stream sensor at the Hillsborough station measured the Eno River at 1.8 feet, an average height for the area. The river loped along at an unremarkable 6,060 gallons per minute.
But then, between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m., Chantal trudged up from the south through central North Carolina. It was a slow, wet storm that carried an immense amount of water vapor, a phenomenon, scientists say, that’s intensified by climate change.
Dark clouds, pregnant with moisture, began emptying their contents on Orange County. The Eno’s water level spiked to nearly 5 feet. The river, now angry and roiled, thrashed against outcrops of volcanic rock hundreds of millions of years old.

At 6:30 p.m., the Eno flung debris into the river gage, USGS officials said. Rising flood waters inundated the instrumentation. The gage stopped transmitting data and died.
Over the next 12 hours, more than 10 inches of rain fell on Hillsborough, hoisting the Eno out of its banks. The river rose to a record 24.79 feet, based on high water marks, USGS later found, and at its peak, surged to 8.8 million gallons every 60 seconds—more than 1,400 times the amount of the day before.
The Eno inundated the River Pumping Station at the wastewater treatment plant above levels reached during Hurricane Fran in 1996. The pumping station normally receives and transports 75 percent of what leaves the town’s toilets, washing machines and kitchen sinks to the wastewater treatment plant.
Now the plant was inoperable, and raw sewage, diluted with ground, rain and river water, was pouring into the Eno from the manholes upstream.

At the water treatment plant, which provides drinking water to the town, the river infiltrated a partially buried ground storage tank of finished water. Town officials immediately issued a boil water notice and began buying water from Durham, which conveyed it to Hillsborough through interconnected pipes, key to the area’s resiliency.
“BRIC grants were designed to help shift towns from reactive disaster spending to proactive investment to avoid future costs” of storm events, Hillsborough Mayor Mark Bell said at a press conference four days after the disaster. “The impact of Tropical Storm Chantal on the river pumping station is exactly the type of scenario that BRIC grants were intended to protect the public against.”
Nationwide, the chosen projects weren’t splashy: elevating flood-prone buildings, conducting climate change and flood risk assessments, and removing woody debris to help suppress wildfires. Yet during a crisis, the improvements can mean the difference between communities being inundated or incinerated, or not.
After the announcement, a spokesperson called BRIC “yet another example of a wasteful and ineffective FEMA program. It was more concerned with political agendas than helping Americans affected by natural disasters.” The program was established by a Republican-controlled Congress during the first Trump administration.
Nationwide, $3.6 billion in BRIC funding has been eliminated, according to recent FEMA figures. In North Carolina, FEMA owes 40 local governments $121 million, state officials said.
“The changes to the BRIC program by FEMA are disappointing, as this program provides critical federal funding for mitigation projects that build resilient communities across North Carolina,” said Justin Graney, chief of external affairs and communications for North Carolina Emergency Management, which administers the BRIC grants as the FEMA pass-through entity.
Projects that hadn’t started construction—like Hillsborough’s—would receive no money, FEMA officials said at the time, while funding for those being built in phases would end “at an appropriate stopping point.”
Hillsborough had planned to spend $1 million of BRIC funding to build a new pump station to receive drinking water in emergency situations from the Orange Water and Sewer Authority, a utility that serves nearby Chapel Hill and Carrboro, Utilities Director Marie Strandwitz said.
Hillsborough officials consider an emergency water source crucial to future economic development and the UNC Hospital on the south side of town.
Another $6 million in BRIC funding would have paid for the 50-year-old River Pumping Station to be moved and rebuilt out of the floodway, reducing the risk of sewage overflows.
“This is a very substantial amount of money for a small town like Hillsborough,” Bell said. “To lose it suddenly was very impactful.”
The BRIC cancellation exposes dozens of communities in North Carolina—and hundreds more nationwide—to the full effects of disasters worsened by climate change. Until this year, including during the first Trump administration, FEMA underscored the importance of such projects.

In 2018, FEMA cited a study by the National Institute of Building Sciences showing that hazard mitigation saves an average of $6 for every $1 spent on federal grants disbursed for that purpose.
As recently as a week ago, Alex Meyer, director of the White House Office of Intergovernmental Affairs, told the FEMA Review Council, “I believe that we should have a more resilient nation.”
The council’s 12 members are Trump appointees; he tasked them with revamping the agency.
After FEMA announced it was canceling the program, 80 members of Congress, including North Carolina Republicans U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis and U.S. Rep. Chuck Edwards, urged the Trump administration to “take swift action to reinstate the BRIC program, and to work with Congress to identify and implement reforms to strengthen our nation’s resilience for decades to come.”
FEMA did not respond to a request for comment on the congressional letter.
A popular program

BRIC grew out of the Pre-Disaster Mitigation program, established by Congress as part of the Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018 and signed into law by President Donald Trump in his first term. The legislation provided FEMA with annual appropriations for mitigation projects nationwide.
Every year since the first funding round in 2020, demand for BRIC funding has outstripped supply, according to an analysis by Headwaters Economics, a nonpartisan research firm. In 2023, the last funding round, more than 1,200 communities applied, totaling more than $5.7 billion in requests, the firm found. FEMA selected 718 for further review, totaling $1 billion. That left more than $4.7 billion in unfunded community needs.
In the first four rounds of grants, North Carolina was awarded $245 million, FEMA data shows, ranking fourth in the U.S. behind California, New York and Florida.
FEMA covers 75 percent of project costs, with local governments covering the balance. Local governments pay for the projects upfront and then receive reimbursement from FEMA.
A small town left vulnerable to disaster

Hillsborough is a town of 9,800 people, some homegrown and others expatriates who were priced out of nearby Durham and Chapel Hill. Downtown, the streets are narrow, the parking’s free and no building is more than four stories tall.
Several days after the storm, most of Hillsborough’s Riverwalk, a 3-mile, shaded promenade that runs along the Eno below downtown, was closed. Dirt and silt had turned the river the color of chocolate milk. Mosquitos emerged from the mire. Remnants of raw sewage coated flattened grass.
Debris cluttered the river’s rocky banks: broken pipes, a stray propane tank and an errant tire. Enormous old trees had been toppled, their boughs touching the ground likely for the first time in 100 years.

Three months earlier, shortly after FEMA canceled the BRIC program, Hillsborough Town Manager Eric Peterson appeared before the Board of Commissioners to deliver the news.
“This is a crisis,” he said. “It blows a hole in our budget.”
The town had paid for design and engineering—localities must shell out upfront and then ask for reimbursement—and was prepared to bid the drinking water project.
In retrospect, Peterson’s alarm was prescient. “You want to make sure that you’ve got redundant water systems, ensuring that we can get the volume that we need quickly in an emergency,” he told Inside Climate News in April.
Likewise, Peterson was rightfully concerned about the vulnerability of the wastewater treatment plant. “If that River Pumping Station fails, we can’t treat wastewater for over half of our community, for who knows how long,” he said then. “We might have to spend a large amount of money to put a Band-Aid on a 50-year-old station. It would be really wasteful.”
The problem with the BRIC program wasn’t waste but rather red tape, officials from several towns told Inside Climate News. Many local governments in North Carolina waited more than three years for their funding to be approved, only to encounter further delays in receiving any money, even though they had signed contracts with FEMA.
Only one project—a living shoreline and upgrades to N.C. Highway 12 in the coastal community of Duck—had been finished before the program’s cancellation.
Hillsborough officials applied for the BRIC funding in November 2021, but spent the year prior working with an engineering consultant to perfect the application. They proposed starting the first phase of the drinking water project in January 2023, federal records show, and the sewer pumping station six months later.
FEMA took 19 months to review the application. During that time, the agency requested and Hillsborough provided technical and environmental information. Strandwitz said it was unclear why the process took that long.
FEMA finally awarded Hillsborough the funds in August 2023.
Had FEMA moved as quickly as it had originally projected, federal records show the new drinking water booster station would have been finished last month, just before Chantal hit. The relocation of the River Pumping Station would have been completed this coming December.
“This is a historic town,” Peterson said. “We have sewer mains that are over 100 years old. We have a water tank that was built in the 1930s. We have 50-year-old water lines connecting us with Durham that are made out of a fragile material that’s undersized. We’ve just got a long list of very expensive needs, and the BRIC cancellation creates a domino effect in a bad way.”
Hundreds of thousands in damages
On a sultry afternoon five days after the storm, Strandwitz, the town’s utilities director, stood before an array of microphones, mud on her shoes, and prepared to address the media.
Behind her, the wastewater treatment plant hummed, and temporary bypass pumps had been set up to stop the discharge of untreated yet diluted wastewater into the Eno.
Hillsborough officials had lifted the boil water notice after tests showed the drinking water was free of bacteria. Strandwitz asked residents to conserve in part because Durham was still the sole supplier of drinking water, nearly 2 million gallons per day.
The numbers were still coming in, Strandwitz said, but damage estimates are at $450,000.

Most of the damaged infrastructure was not only outside the 100-year flood plain—meaning the location has a 1 percent chance of flooding in any given year—but also the 500-year benchmark. Those areas have just a 0.2 percent chance of flooding annually.
To compensate for the loss of BRIC money, local governments like Hillsborough could apply for Hazard Mitigation Grant Program funds. The state administers those grants, but the funding ultimately comes from FEMA.
“This determination will be made when further clarity is received from FEMA,” North Carolina Emergency Management’s Graney said. “NCEM is committed to assisting communities with finding possible solutions as we believe that these projects have a positive impact on a community’s resilience.”
If the funding comes through, Hillsborough’s projects will be further delayed by six to eight months, because the state’s review process doesn’t begin until October, Strandwitz said.
The new river pumping station would be built on an acre of land upstream, outside the 500-year flood plain.

Mike Braun, left, and U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon visit Purdue University on July 16, 2025. (Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Indiana Gov. Mike Braun welcomed U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to Purdue University on Wednesday, with the federal leader praising Indiana for its education initiatives that put “parents in the driver’s seat” for K-12 and higher education.











In particular, leaders celebrated a decade-plus of frozen tuition rates at Purdue and other initiatives as a “model for higher education” during President Donald Trump’s transformative second term.











“I’ve looked at all the things that are going on in Indiana and they really do match exactly what the President’s goals are,” said McMahon. “… He certainly believes more choice is what we ought to have, and I think Indiana has certainly proven that all those things work to the benefit of students in K-12 and higher education.” 
McMahon declined to comment on an ongoing “review” of $6.8 billion in frozen federal funding earmarked for grade schools, including $107 million destined for Indiana schools. Likewise, she dismissed concerns about the loss of civil rights protections for minority or disabled students, pointing to other avenues for relief through the Department of Justice. 
McMahon’s department, one of many with ongoing mass layoffs, is set to be dismantled under Trump, who previously said he wants McMahon “to put herself out of a job.” Wednesday’s visit comes amid a nationwide reckoning for higher education institutions, some of which are grappling with hundreds of millions of dollars in frozen funds and other Trump administration threats. 
But McMahon called Purdue’s 14-year streak of frozen tuition rates “absolutely remarkable,” while Gov. Mike Braun said the university was “at the forefront of how higher education should be run.”

“You’re kind of the model for what higher education needs to be across the country, and now other public schools in our state have followed suit,” Braun said. “The legislature and I … we’ve put that out there as kind of our mantra: parents in the driver’s seat for their own kids’ education — from K-12 and then post secondary as well.”
McMahon and Braun sat in on a closed door roundtable discussion with over a dozen other state leaders, including bankers, philanthropists, school corporation superintendents and Republican legislative leaders. 
“We’ve worked hard to build out a recipe for success,” said Indiana Education Secretary Katie Jenner. “I think we’re still at the starting point, and have more work to do.”
Jenner highlighted the state’s ongoing effort to overhaul its high school diploma and support more apprenticeship programs. 
“We frequently get everyone in the room — early and often — and listen,” continued Jenner. “… (by) listening to each other, we’ve had a lot of conversation in education (on) how we might really listen more to business and industry leaders to really let us know what are the knowledge and skills we could really improve on.” 
 Parents driving higher education learning

Both McMahon and Braun emphasized the need for parents to lead on education issues, even when those young adults leave home and attend higher education institutions. But, when asked, Braun said it wasn’t coddling. 
“Because that discussion about what you’re going to do for the rest of your life is going to be mostly the parents thinking about it before their kids are ready to,” Braun said. “The key thing is having options, so parents know what the best ideas are.
“Parents are going to be in the driver’s seat, because they’re generally going to pay the bills. They, along with their kids, formulate what’s best for them,” Braun continued.

Braun said that higher education — and health care, another core focus for his administration — didn’t innovate enough, which drove up costs. He highlighted the renewed focus on apprenticeships as an alternative. 
And while McMahon lauded Indiana and Purdue’s focus on apprenticeships, she panned any mandated efforts at the federal level. 
“The federal government will continue to provide the kind of funding that is already appropriated by Congress,” said McMahon. “… but what the president, what the federal government, wants to do is get out of the way and remove a lot of regulation. Let’s get more money into the states that’s now spent on bureaucracy. I think that’s what you’ll see.”
The workforce-focused visit comes on the heels of a 15% staff reduction at the Department of Workforce Development, which Braun described as an event “that would never be a criterion or a metric in the real world of running something.”
“It’s about how you get the most out of the resources you’ve got and, in many cases, you do it better,” Braun said, describing the state and other industries as “bloated with middle management.”
Rather, he said it was a reflection of state employment growing faster than the economy. 
“Wait and see,” he said. “It’s very little workforce reduction (and) only to where it’s going to make that agency work better.”

How did one end up in Connecticut’s budget this session?
WSHU’s Ebong Udoma spoke with CT Mirror’s Mark Pazniokas to discuss his article, “In chaos at CT Capitol, two waste haulers found favors,” as part of the collaborative podcast Long Story Short. Read Mark’s story here.
WSHU: Hello, Mark. This is a fascinating expose of some of the unsavory ways in which the sausage is made at the state capitol. First, could you explain what a rat is and why lawmakers often don’t want to take credit?
MP: Yes, at the Connecticut capitol, rat is a term applied to legislative language that appears in another bill without any public vetting or, quite often, any even public mention, and it’s usually a narrowly tailored favor for someone or some interest so that, in a nutshell, is what we call a rat.
WSHU: And now what happened in the final days of this year’s legislative session with two haulers, two waste haulers, got a favor, and no one seems to want to take credit for it. Could you just explain what the favor is and how it happened?
MP: Well, it’s funny. There is, I had a temptation to use a quotation attributed to Sun Tzu, who is credited with writing the Art of War, and the line is, “in the midst of chaos, there also is opportunity.” It does get to the nature of how these things happen. So let’s talk about what the favor was, and then how it got in. So the favor, quite frankly, is there’s a lawyer who has two clients in the waste hauling business. One is called Country Holdings, and they own an old transfer station which was also the site of a trash to energy plant that’s been gone for years, and there’s all kinds of environmental violations there. And they cannot get a permit to operate this thing until that’s resolved, and they have been in negotiations with the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, from what I can tell from the records, for it looks like a year. The other client is called Enviro Express, and they have a contract to operate a transfer station in Torrington.
And this gets very complicated, but I’m going to try to keep it simple. The Torrington transfer station was one of the assets of something called MIRA, the Materials Innovation Resource Authority, which used to run the state’s biggest trash energy plant, which handled 1/3 of all the state solid waste in Hartford, in the south meadows of Hartford. And that thing has been closed for a few years. So this group MIRA was winding down, and they were shedding their various other assets that still had value, including a couple of transfer stations. So the Torrington issue was, who was going to take control of that transfer station, which is still necessary to process waste in the northwest corner of Connecticut. The MIRA dissolution authority, they were negotiating with public officials up in the Northwest Hills about maybe creating a new authority. In the end, they ended up selling it to another private waste hauler called USA. And they’re a big family owned company in Connecticut. And the USA contract was basically submarined by this rat. What the rat did with Torrington, it transferred ownership of the operation permit, though not the possession, not the actual ownership of the property to this new Northwest Hills resource authority.
WSHU: Which has not been created yet.
MP: Which is really just a name in the bill. It doesn’t, yes. And then so the Wallingford issue, that portion of the rat directed the Department of Energy Environmental Protection to issue a temporary operating permit without any of the normal reviews. I mean, the reviews for these things are extensive. They look at engineering, they look at the impact on the host community, regarding odor, traffic, noise, you know, all that stuff, and they also review the finances of the applicant. So this was a pretty extraordinary thing to slip in and the way it occurred. Now let’s talk about how it happened.
WSHU: This is an advertisement for lobbyists and how lobbyists get their work done. So go right ahead, please.
MP: So there’s something called a budget implementer. It’s basically the big bill that essentially is the budget, but it has language that also implements the budget, which requires explanation. So the good thing about how the Connecticut General Assembly works is there’s a requirement that that main budget bill be available for public review for at least 12 hours. That’s called the 12 hour rule. Sometimes some of those 12 hours are before the sun comes up, because the staff might finish it and put it in the computer system at three or four in the morning. And that’s pretty much what happened this year. I think it was four in the morning, because they could not begin the budget debate till four in the afternoon. So that part is sort of above board, more or less. But then, you know, they note, okay, you got to do some corrections, some revisions. Some are technical, some are not. And that amendment, there’s no 12 hour rule. That amendment was 65 pages that drops just as the debate is beginning, and in that amendment is this language about the Wallingford transfer station permit and then the permit for Torrington.
WSHU: During the debate that was raised, questions were asked. What were the answers?
MP: Well, and there was no great answer. And in fact, you know, Representative Maria Horn, who, by the way, is a very well respected member of the General Assembly. She’s the co-chair of the Finance, Revenue and Bonding Committee. It was left to her to bring out this amendment on the floor of the House, and it became pretty clear she was not fully apprised of everything that was in that 65 page amendment. So the Republicans started asking some very sharp questions. And it was, again, it was clear that Representative Horn, whom the Republicans are quick to say, she’s very bright, she’s very fair to deal with and but she was kind of stuck with a dirty job, and it turned out to be an embarrassment for Representative Horn.
WSHU: And this is a must pass bill, because this is the budget bill, and there was pressure to get it done before the session ended.
MP: So that’s a great point. The surest bet at the Capitol on passing something is if you can get it into this budget implementer bill, because that is, you’re absolutely right. This is the one bill all year that we know will pass, because you need a budget in place. And that’s why it’s an attractive target to try to get these other things in. Sometimes there’s really nothing at all nefarious or secret about it. You might have a bill that was fully vetted, subject to public hearing, public input, perhaps even past one chamber, but time was running out. So you stick those bills into this implementer that you know is going to pass, and that always, that always happens. And then there’s also some things that are pretty routine on that is, you know, wide support for so it’s a messy process, but it is something that most of it, it’s, you know, arguably, good public policy. It’s the way you have to get it done when time is running short.
The thing that was unusual about this, and the thing that I tried to track, is the origins of the rat that provided the favors to Wallingford and Torrington interest that was written by a lawyer who represents both those clients, Joe Mazzarella. He works for a big law firm called McCarter and English, and in fairness to Mr. Mazzarella, when I called him, he was pretty straightforward, he said yes, the language is mine. I said, Well, how did you get it into the budget? He said, Well, I sent it to the chiefs of staff for the House and the Senate Democratic majorities. And I said, Well, you just sent it without notice? And he said, Well, you know, I mean, there were people interested in these things. There were conversations, but that gets very fuzzy. And the thing that’s interesting is none of the caucus leaders will admit to having known what this did. They suggest it was not flagged for their attention by staff. And that’s unusual, by the way. From some other years, two years ago, there was a another interesting rat that I wrote about, because my interest in this as a reporter is it’s an opportunity to explore and explain how when you’re doing the final strokes of putting the budget together, it’s pretty opaque and it’s not terribly accountable. And two years ago, there was language put in a single sentence that effectively blocked the construction of a huge distribution center in Middlebury, Connecticut that was going to go up in a neighborhood where there’s a state lawmaker who lived and he didn’t like it, and his neighbors didn’t like it, and it overruled Home Rule, which is not the typical Republican approach.
WSHU: As a matter of fact, one of the things they have against the big housing bill that was passed this year was that it was eroding Home Rule. And here it is, a Republican lawmaker is getting the state to override. But they took credit for that.
MP: Yes. But I will give people credit that two years ago, when I went to all the various players, the leaders of all four legislative caucuses, the governor’s office, they all acknowledged to me being aware of it. They pointed out where it came from. Vinny Candelora, the House Republican leader, said, Yes, this was something one of his members asked for. They put it in. So again, you can say it was an abuse of the system, but at least there was eventually transparency. When I approached them, I was able to pin it down. This time, not so much.
WSHU: Well, thank you so much. Thank you, Mark.

(Spanberger photo by Markus Schmidt/Virginia Mercury, Earle-Sears photo by Parker Michels-Boyce for the Virginia Mercury)With fewer than four months to go before Virginians elect a new slate of statewide leaders, a new poll from Virginia Commonwealth University’s L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs finds Democrats holding early leads in all three top races — and voters sharply focused on economic pressures and personal freedoms.
The latest Commonwealth Poll, conducted June 19–July 3, captures evolving voter sentiment in advance of the 2025 election and suggests momentum has shifted further toward Democratic candidates, particularly among independents.
In the closely watched race for governor, former U.S. Rep. Abigail Spanberger, the Democratic nominee, leads Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears by 12 points, 49% to 37%. That marks an improvement from the Wilder School’s previous poll in December 2024, which showed Spanberger ahead 45% to 35%.
State Sen. Ghazala Hashmi, D-Richmond, running for lieutenant governor, leads Republican John Reid, a conservative radio host, 46% to 36%. 
Meanwhile, former Democratic Del. Jay Jones holds a 47% to 38% lead over incumbent Republican Attorney General Jason Miyares.
While Democrats lead across the board, the poll also highlights significant uncertainty: nearly half of independents — 47% — remain undecided in all three races. 
Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who has spent months working to raise his national profile, remains in relatively good standing with his Republican base but is struggling with independents.
Among registered voters, 49% said they approve of the job Youngkin is doing, while 39% disapprove. The Republican governor enjoys overwhelming support from his party (84%) but low ratings among Democrats (20%). Independents are split, with 51% disapproving. That marks a slight decline from December, when Youngkin had a 51% approval rating and 38% disapproval.
President Donald Trump, who remains the GOP’s most dominant figure nationally, is faring far worse with Virginia voters. Just 40% approve of the job he is doing, while 55% disapprove.
Trump’s numbers highlight a stark partisan divide — he enjoys 84% approval among Republicans but faces near-universal disapproval from Democrats (93%) and strong rejection from independents (66%).
When asked to identify the issue most influencing their vote, 28% of Virginia voters named the rising cost of living — far and away the top concern. Women’s reproductive rights (14%) and immigration (14%) followed, rounding out the top three.
This marks a notable shift from the December 2024 poll, when 58% of voters said the cost of living was their top issue and 14% pointed to K-12 education as their second priority.
The change indicates a possible reframing of the 2025 campaign narrative — with economic pressures and civil liberties now front and center as Virginians prepare to choose their next leaders.
“The poll results show a clear message from the voters: Performance matters, and so do priorities. This poll should be a wake-up call,” Wilder, the 66th governor of Virginia and the nation’s first elected Black governor, said in a statement. 
“Governor Youngkin’s slipping numbers among independents and the overwhelming disapproval of Trump make clear that Virginia voters are not buying political spin. They want action on the issues that hit hardest: the rising costs of living, threats to women’s rights and immigration policies. The shift from education to economic and personal freedoms shows an engaged electorate.”
Wilder added, “As always has been maintained in this space, money and its influence will play a pivotal role in all of the elections. The people are speaking. The question is: Are the ‘leaders’ listening?”
The Summer 2025 Commonwealth Poll is based on telephone interviews with a representative sample of 809 adults aged 18 and older living in Virginia. Of those, 764 respondents identified themselves as registered voters, and their responses form the basis of the findings referenced in this release. Interviews were conducted via landline (80) and cell phone (729), including 558 respondents who did not have a landline.
The poll’s margin of error is 4.16 percentage points.

(Photo courtesy of the American Wild Horse Campaign)President Donald Trump’s effort to eliminate longstanding protections preventing the slaughter of America’s wild horses hit a snag this week when the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations included language in a Department of The Interior funding bill that reaffirmed the protections.
Trump’s budget proposal to slash funding for the Bureau of Land Management’s Wild Horse and Burro program by 25% would have allowed the slaughter of some 64,000 federal protected wild horses in government holding facilities.
“The action by the House Appropriations Committee, in response to our June 11, 2025, letter, to again prohibit the slaughter of wild horses corrects an omission in the President’s Budget Request,” U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said in a statement to the Current.
Trump’s proposal “would have also allowed for the large-scale transfer of wild horses and burros to foreign countries such as Canada and Mexico, where horse slaughter facilities continue to operate,” the American Wild Horse Campaign said in a news release.
The effort mirrored Trump’s 2017 budget, which initially called for a 30% cut to the program’s funding and the elimination of protections against slaughter. Congress restored the protections against killing the animals and augmented funding.
The House bill appropriates $144 million to the BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program.
The measure “reaffirms Congressional intent to prohibit slaughter and reflects the values of the American people,” Suzanne Roy, executive director of AWHC, said in a news release.
Legislation introduced by Titus last week calls for the BLM to employ humane roundup techniques.
“Wild horses need to be protected from slaughter but also from helicopter roundups that can injure and kill them,” Titus said. “What is needed now is action by Congress on my legislation to eliminate the use of helicopters in BLM wild horse roundups and require a report to explore the benefits of alternative methods for humanely gathering horses, such as employing traditional cowboys.”
In the last five years, the government has spent at least $36.7 million on roundups, according to Titus, including more than $6 million paid in one year to helicopter roundup contractors.
“Scientific research has shown that more humane and cost-effective alternatives, like fertility control, are equally effective in controlling equine populations,” Titus said in a news release. “The BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program, however, currently spends less than four percent of its budget on these methods.”

“The Book of Psalms says the children are a gift from the Lord. They are a reward from him,” said Kamoustas, who started his position July 14. 
“On my first day as Commissioner of Education, it was important for me to connect with parents, teachers, and superintendents across the state to ensure that we are working together for the common goal of educating our students to the best of our abilities and prioritizing them as the blessing that they are in our lives.”
To that end, Kamoustas has issued a series of missives to parents and teachers advising them of their statutory rights while cautioning superintendents that he was“putting them on notice that if they violate these rights, I will be knocking on their door. This is not an empty threat.”  
Kamousta’s letter to the parents is being mailed out on his behalf by local school superintendents. The commissioner said he hasn’t gotten any pushback from local officials about the letters.
He said a separate memorandum was being sent Wednesday to school districts, charter schools, and private schools advising them to update information in a statewide online parent porta, Myfloridaschools.
“Florida is the education state because we have removed indoctrination from instruction, we have empowered our teachers to create learning environments without repeated disruptions, and we have supported the power of the parent to make important decisions in the education of their child,” he said.

Florida’s education commissioner plays a major role shaping education policy in a state that has drawn national attention for its contentious policies on library book removals and diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Kamoutsas is the former deputy chief of staff for Gov. Ron DeSantis, but the new job puts him in a familiar place. He started at the Department of Education in 2019, serving as general counsel and eventually chief of staff before leaving the DOE to join the governor’s staff in 2023. 
He succeeds Manny Diaz, who left the post to serve as interim president at the University of West Florida in Pensacola.
Kamoutsas touted 2024-2025 school grades that show Florida has 6% more A-rated schools (based on its own metrics) with 28 of Florida’s 67 districts earning As. He also pointed to improvements in math and reading on Florida assessment tests, although Florida scores dropped on the National Assessment of Educational Progress.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota attorneys and judicial officials say a lack of funding for a key federal program could harm federal defendants’ ability to get quality representation.
The U.S. Constitution protects criminal defendants’ right to an attorney. When federal defendants can’t afford a lawyer, they are typically assigned a federal public defender. About 40% of the time, however, federal defenders must pass the case to a private lawyer due to a conflict of interest, according to the judicial branch.
But the federal judiciary says that as of July 3, it has no more money to pay outside attorneys for these services. The judicial branch has asked Congress for roughly $116 million to sustain the program until the fiscal year turns over on Oct. 1.
The federal courts draw from panels of approved private defense attorneys when federal public defenders cannot take a case. North Dakota’s pool of private attorneys usually averages around 100 people, said Jason Tupman, the federal public defender for North Dakota and South Dakota.
However, membership with the panels is voluntary, and about 10 attorneys have resigned from North Dakota’s since the judicial branch learned of the impending budget shortfall this spring, he said.
“The vast majority of our panel are either very small lawyers and oftentimes solo practitioners,” Tupman said. “Anytime you’re saying, ‘Hey, you’re not going to get a paycheck for three months for money we owe you,’ that’s going to have an impact on them.”
The U.S. District Court for North Dakota as of Tuesday had $110,000 in pending payments to panel lawyers, according to Clerk of Court Kari Knudson. The lack of federal funding also means that any expert witnesses or court reporters the attorneys hire also won’t get paid, she said.
Some of the defense attorneys who have withdrawn are among the most experienced in the state, said Mark Friese, who serves as the liaison between North Dakota’s panel and the federal judiciary.
“Some of them that have elected not to renew are really, really good lawyers,” he said.
Tupman and Friese last week sent a letter to North Dakota’s congressional delegation calling attention to the budget gap.
“Without reliable funding, attorneys will continue to withdraw, decline appointments or delay critical work,” they said in the letter. “Trials will be postponed, and the effectiveness of our federal courts will be significantly compromised.”
Friese, who has served on North Dakota’s panel for nearly 25 years, said he’s seen payments to attorneys deferred in the past due to budget issues but never for several months.
“I haven’t seen one like this where we have to go out and tell our panel lawyers they can’t be paid and they won’t be until sometime after October,” he said.
Tupman said some attorneys who are still serving on the panel appear less willing than usual to accept new appointments. He said he suspects this could be due to the funding gap, though it’s hard to know for sure.
He said panel attorneys in South Dakota are tracked differently, so he’s not aware of whether it is also seeing membership diminish.
Some defense attorneys are continuing to accept appointments without pay.
“The lawyers that do this just do this out of a sense of commitment,” Friese said. “With criminal cases in North Dakota, the economic reality is these lawyers can make more money by doing things on their own or with their firm than by taking these cases.”
About 90% of federal criminal defendants can’t afford to hire an attorney, according to the federal court system.
 

Generally, the judicial branch pays all panel attorneys $175 per hour. This is lower than the market rate, said Friese.
Spokespeople for Rep. Julie Fedorchak and Sen. John Hoeven, both Republicans, told the North Dakota Monitor they are looking at the issue.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a former defense attorney, said he plans to speak to members of Congress about the situation when he’s in D.C. this week for a congressional hearing.
“It’s a real problem,” he said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
Since October of last year, the U.S. District Court for North Dakota has paid outside attorneys more than $2.7 million to represent defendants, Knudson said.
Chief Judge Peter Welte said that the funding gap has yet to have a noticeable impact on his court.
“The court is continuing to function well, and on a day-to-day operations standpoint, I don’t feel like we’ve been suffering yet,” he said.
Still, Welte said the deficit worries him. He said he anticipates money will remain a problem for federal courts in the upcoming fiscal year.
“The federal budgeting process has been a constant issue since I took the bench,” he said.
The current funding gap comes as the district court is on track to outpace last year’s caseload in all categories, he added.
North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor said he also isn’t aware of any immediate impacts to his court, but was critical of the shortfall.
“This is no way to run a railroad much less the U.S. government,” he said in a statement to the Monitor.
Federal defenders offices nationwide have been under a hiring freeze for almost two years. As a result, the Federal Defenders Office for North Dakota and South Dakota is staffed at 80-90% capacity, Tupman said. His office has 51 employees.
“It makes for higher case loads and more stress,” he said.

The Delaware Office of the State Fire Marshal is warning residents against the use of Class “L” fire extinguishers, a new type of device being marketed for use on lithium battery fires.
According to state officials, these extinguishers have not been tested or approved by a recognized third-party laboratory such as Underwriters Laboratories (UL), which raises serious concerns about their effectiveness and safety.
While lithium battery fires are a growing concern, the Office wants to ensure that residents are using only equipment that meets current safety standards.
Under Delaware’s current fire code — the 2021 State Fire Prevention Regulations — fire protection devices must be listed and approved.

Since Class “L” extinguishers do not meet that requirement, they are not permitted for use in the state.
The National Fire Protection Association’s 2022 edition of NFPA 10, the standard for portable fire extinguishers, also does not recognize Class “L” as an approved classification.
The standard continues to officially designate Class A, B, C, D, and K extinguishers, all of which are tested and approved for use in Delaware.
Officials are urging the public to use only listed fire extinguishers and to consult with fire safety professionals if they have questions about protecting their homes or businesses from battery-related fires.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-16-at-11.33.38-AM.png,,,2025-07-16 13:24:46.648833

Researchers from ChristianaCare’s Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute and the University of Delaware have uncovered what may be a fundamental set of rules that keep human tissue organized, even as the body replaces billions of cells every day.
In a recent study published in the scientific journal Biology of the Cell, researchers demonstrate how five simple rules can govern the precise structure and behavior of tissues like the colon, offering what they describe as a possible “tissue code.”
“This may be the biological version of a blueprint,” said Bruce Boman, M.D., Ph.D., senior research scientist at ChristianaCare’s Cawley Center for Translational Cancer Research and a faculty member in the departments of Biological Sciences and Mathematical Sciences at the University of Delaware.
“Just like we have a genetic code that explains how our genes work, we may also have a ‘tissue code’ that explains how our bodies stay so precisely organized over time,” he said. 
RELATED STORY: ChristianaCare celebrates construction milestone for Aston Hospital
The breakthrough comes after more than 15 years of collaboration between cancer biologists and mathematicians who developed computer simulations to model cell behavior. They focused on the human colon, where cells regenerate every few days yet maintain a stable, functional structure.
Using mathematical modeling, the team identified five core rules:

Timing of cell division
The order in which cells divide
The direction cells divide and move
How many times cells divide
How long a cell lives before it dies

“These rules work together like choreography,” said Gilberto Schleiniger, Ph.D., professor in the University of Delaware’s Department of Mathematical Sciences. “They control where cells go, when they divide and how long they stick around — and that’s what keeps tissues looking and working the way they should.”
The research suggests that these rules may apply broadly across different tissues in the body — from skin and liver to brain tissue — and could help scientists better understand processes such as wound healing, developmental disorders, and cancer.
“Tissues don’t just grow and shrink randomly. They know what they’re supposed to look like, and they know how to get back to that state, even after damage,” Boman said. “That level of precision needs a set of instructions. What we’ve found is a strong candidate for those instructions.”

These insights may also support global scientific efforts such as the Human Cell Atlas, which aims to map every cell type in the body. While the Atlas catalogs what cells are doing at a given moment, this new research provides a framework for understanding how they maintain organization over time.

The team’s use of mathematical modeling, rather than traditional lab experiments, allowed them to simulate and analyze behaviors that are difficult to observe in real time.
“This is just the beginning,” Schleiniger said. “Once you can identify the rules, you can begin to ask entirely new questions, and maybe even learn how to fix what’s gone wrong.”
The study aligns with the National Science Foundation’s “Rules of Life” initiative, which seeks to uncover basic principles that govern living systems. The next phase of the project includes experimental testing of the model’s predictions and further exploration of how disruptions in the tissue code might contribute to cancer development or metastasis.

John Hoffman and his wife were also shot and hospitalized in a separate incident. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said during a press conference that the shooting ""appears to be a politically motivated assassination."" (Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)A federal grand jury indicted Vance Boelter on six felony charges related to the killings of Minnesota Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, and the shooting of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman, in the early morning hours of June 14.
The U.S. Department of Justice filed the initial charges on June 15, the day Boelter was arrested outside of Green Isle after a two-day manhunt. After charging someone with a felony through a complaint signed by a judge, the DOJ must present evidence to a grand jury in order to formalize the charges.
The charges in the indictment were revised to include an allegation that Boelter shot at Hope Hoffman, the daughter of John and Yvette Hoffman. The bullets narrowly missed Hope, and she immediately called 911 to report the shooting, according to an unsealed application for a search warrant.
The indictment includes two counts of stalking Melissa Hortman and John Hoffman; two counts of murder in the killings of Melissa and Mark Hortman; and two firearms offenses in the shootings of the Hortmans and John and Yvette Hoffman, and the attempted shooting of Hope Hoffman.
The indictment also contains a “notice of special findings,” the first step in seeking the death penalty, said acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Joe Thompson in a press conference Tuesday. Prosecutors have not yet made a decision on whether to seek the death penalty, and that decision will be up to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, DOJ officials and the victims, Thompson said.
The search warrant application provides some details of the crime that were not included in the original charging documents, including the full text of a letter found in Boelter’s car that contains fantastical ravings about his motives that are replete with disinformation. The letter contradicts other writings found in his cars and home, which indicated he sought out politicians, abortion rights advocates and abortion providers.
“Was it a delusion that he believes, or was it a delusion that is designed as an effort to misdirect our investigation or to, frankly, excuse his crimes?” Thompson said of the letter. “That’s a good question. It certainly seems designed to excuse his crimes.”
The documents also clarify the sequence of events at the Hortmans’ home that night.
According to the search warrant: Mark Hortman answered the door when Vance Boelter knocked, announcing himself as a police officer. Boelter and Mark Hortman spoke for a few moments, then Brooklyn Park police pulled up to the house to perform a welfare check. Immediately after, Boelter shot Mark Hortman several times, then entered the house and shot Melissa Hortman and their dog, Gilbert.
A camera located near Boelter’s temporary residence in north Minneapolis showed Boelter wearing a rain coat with the hood up at around 7 p.m. on June 13, the night before the killings, apparently placing a duffel bag and body armor in his SUV.
Later that evening — hours before the shootings — cameras at the Hortman home captured a man in a rain coat with the hood up walking around the side and back of the yard.

As sea level rise along Delaware’s coast, the state is preparing for the natural shift of its tidal wetlands.
A new mapping study released by the Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) outlines where these critical ecosystems are most likely—and most able—to move in the coming decades.
The study, led by DNREC’s Wetland Monitoring and Assessment Program and Coastal Programs, identifies and scores areas across the state based on their “suitability” for future marsh migration.
This process, also known as wetland migration, involves tidal marshes shifting inland to escape inundation as sea levels rise.

Using geographic information system (GIS) data, the study evaluated land across Delaware under three sea level rise (SLR) scenarios—2 feet, 4 feet, and 7 feet. Under the mid-range 4-foot SLR scenario, the model found 21,449 acres statewide were highly suitable for marsh migration.

Sussex County tops the list
Sussex County was identified as having the most potential, with 9,418 acres rated as highly suitable.
Kent County followed with 8,482 acres, and New Castle County had 3,549 acres.
The suitability scores—ranging from 0 (unsuitable) to 12 (highly suitable)—were based on factors such as elevation, land use, and proximity to current tidal wetlands.
The findings help pinpoint not just where wetlands are likely to go, but also where efforts to support that movement should be focused.
Most suitable land is privately owned
The study found that roughly 70% of the most suitable areas are currently made up of non-tidal wetlands and agricultural land—and most of that land is privately owned.
DNREC officials say this underscores the importance of working with landowners to ensure that these ecological shifts can occur naturally and successfully.
Lower-scoring areas may still support wetland migration under certain conditions, according to the study, but may face barriers like disconnected waterways or urban development.
Planning tool for conservation and climate resilience
Beyond identifying land, the mapping effort is also intended to serve as a tool for planners, conservationists, and property owners to better manage land use and strengthen Delaware’s climate resilience.
The state has produced both a technical report and a simplified outreach flyer to help different audiences understand and apply the results.
Among the study’s recommended uses:

Prioritizing conservation of highly suitable land
Identifying barriers to wetland movement
Integrating migration paths into public land management plans
Encouraging collaborative planning with stakeholders

The updated study builds on DNREC’s original 2017 marsh migration model, reflecting new data and evolving climate projections.
An interactive version of the 4-foot sea level rise scenario has been made available via FirstMap Delaware, the state’s public geospatial data platform.
DNREC hopes the findings will guide local governments, landowners, and conservation groups in making informed decisions that support both ecological and community resilience.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-16-at-11.06.30-AM.png,,,2025-07-16 13:24:46.648833

(Photo courtesy of the American Wild Horse Campaign)President Donald Trump’s effort to eliminate longstanding protections preventing the slaughter of America’s wild horses hit a snag this week when the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations included language in an Interior Dept. funding bill that reaffirmed the protections. 
Trump’s budget proposal to slash funding for the Bureau of Land Management’s Wild Horse and Burro program by 25% would have allowed the slaughter of some 64,000 federal protected wild horses in government holding facilities. 
“The action by the House Appropriations Committee, in response to our June 11, 2025, letter, to again prohibit the slaughter of wild horses corrects an omission in the President’s Budget Request,” U.S. Rep. Dina Titus, a Democrat from Nevada, said in a statement to the Current. 
Trump’s proposal “would have also allowed for the large-scale transfer of wild horses and burros to foreign countries such as Canada and Mexico, where horse slaughter facilities continue to operate,” the American Wild Horse Conservation (AWHC) said in a news release. 
The effort mirrored Trump’s 2017 budget, which initially called for a 30% cut to the program’s funding and the elimination of protections against slaughter. Congress restored the protections against killing the animals and augmented funding. 
The House bill appropriates $144 million to the BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program. 
The measure “reaffirms Congressional intent to prohibit slaughter and reflects the values of the American people,” Suzanne Roy, executive director of AWHC, said in a news release. 
Legislation introduced by Titus last week calls for the BLM to employ humane roundup techniques. 
“Wild horses need to be protected from slaughter but also from helicopter roundups that can injure and kill them,” Titus said. “What is needed now is action by Congress on my legislation to eliminate the use of helicopters in BLM wild horse roundups and require a report to explore the benefits of alternative methods for humanely gathering horses, such as employing traditional cowboys.” 
In the last five years, the government has spent at least $36.7 million on roundups, according to Titus, including more than $6 million paid in one year to helicopter roundup contractors. 
“Scientific research has shown that more humane and cost-effective alternatives, like fertility control, are equally effective in controlling equine populations,” Titus said in a news release. “The BLM’s Wild Horse and Burro Program, however, currently spends less than four percent of its budget on these methods.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/IMG_4372-1024x578.jpg,,,2025-07-16 13:24:46.648833

Pennsylvania is not among them.
More than half of the states have created school policies to define artificial intelligence, develop best practices for using AI systems and more, according to a report from AI for Education, an advocacy group that provides AI literacy training for educators.
Despite efforts by the Trump administration to loosen federal and state AI rules in hopes of boosting innovation, teachers and students need a lot of state-level guidance for navigating the fast-moving technology, said Amanda Bickerstaff, the CEO and co-founder of AI for Education.
“What most people think about when it comes to AI adoption in the schools is academic integrity,” she said. “One of the biggest concerns that we’ve seen — and one of the reasons why there’s been a push towards AI guidance, both at the district and state level — is to provide some safety guidelines around responsible use and to create opportunities for people to know what is appropriate.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
North Carolina, which last year became one of the first states to issue AI guidance for schools, set out to study and define generative artificial intelligence for potential uses in the classroom. The policy also includes resources for students and teachers interested in learning how to interact with AI models successfully.
In addition to classroom guidance, some states emphasize ethical considerations for certain AI models. Following Georgia’s initial framework in January, the state shared additional guidance in June outlining ethical principles educators should consider before adopting the technology.
This year, Maine, Missouri, Nevada and New Mexico also released guidelines for AI in schools.
In the absence of regulations at the federal level, states are filling a critical gap, said Maddy Dwyer, a policy analyst for the Equity in Civic Technology team at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit working to advance civil rights in the digital age.
While most state AI guidance for schools focuses on the potential benefits, risks and need for human oversight, Dwyer wrote in a recent blog post that many of the frameworks are missing out on critical AI topics, such as community engagement and deepfakes, or manipulated photos and videos.
“I think that states being able to fill the gap that is currently there is a critical piece to making sure that the use of AI is serving kids and their needs, and enhancing their educational experiences rather than detracting from them,” she said.

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
 The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.













There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
 Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

U.S. District Court Judge Sean Jordan of Texas’s Eastern District, who was appointed by President Donald Trump, found on Friday that the rule exceeded the CFPB ‘s authority. Jordan said that the CFPB is not permitted to remove medical debt from credit reports according to the Fair Credit Reporting Act, which protects information collected by consumer reporting agencies.
Removing medical debt from consumer credit reports was expected to increase the credit scores of millions of families by an average of 20 points, the bureau said. The CFPB states that its research has shown outstanding healthcare claims to be a poor predictor of an individual’s ability to repay a loan, yet they are often used to deny mortgage applications.
The three national credit reporting agencies — Experian, Equifax and TransUnion — announced last year that they would remove medical collections under $500 from U.S. consumer credit reports. The CFPB’s rule was projected to ban all outstanding medical bills from appearing on credit reports and prohibit lenders from using the information.
The CFPB estimated the rule would have removed $49 billion in medical debt from the credit reports of 15 million Americans. According to the agency, one in five Americans has at least one medical debt collection account on their credit reports, and over half of the collection entries on credit reports are for medical debts. The problem disproportionately affects people of color, the CFPB has found: 28% of Black people and 22% of Latino people in the U.S. carry medical debt versus 17% of white people.
The CFPB was established by Congress after the 2008 financial crisis to monitor credit card companies, mortgage providers, debt collectors and other segments of the consumer finance industry. Earlier this year, the Trump administration requested that the agency halt nearly all its operations, effectively shutting it down.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP25196663569851-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 11:08:41.536399

Low prices for row crops and high costs for fertilizer are squeezing Midwest row-crop farmers while the Southeast is still on an economic winning streak, according to a Stateline analysis of federal economic data for the first quarter. (Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.
There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
USDA chief outlines plan to block China from U.S. farmland ownership

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
The land ethic of our grandparents is key to our grandchildren’s future

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

(Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.










There isn't a single app out there that's going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That's just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, physician and health economist


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
Arkansas’ example
Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
Other state efforts
Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

Sign up here to get the latest stories from THE CITY delivered to you each morning.
After torrential rains on Monday that turned several station entrances into waterfalls, experts warned that the subway system will remain exposed to recurring flash flooding — unless the city and the MTA better collaborate on multibillion-dollar stormproofing projects.
Described by MTA officials as the second-biggest one-hour downpour in city history, the storm overwhelmed the subway, with more than 2 inches of rain crippling service on several lines and producing the latest striking images of water pouring down station entrances and onto platforms and trains.
Janno Lieber, the chairperson and chief executive of the MTA, said the city’s stormwater management system was not up to the task of processing more than an inch and a half in an hour.
“That’s when you get the backup into the stations, into the tunnels and you see that kind of geyser-like condition where a manhole gets popped because there is so much water backed up,” Lieber said on the PIX11 Morning News. “We are urging the city government to please take steps to expand the capacity of the stormwater management [system].”
While the MTA was able to fully restore subway service in time for the Tuesday morning commute, experts warned that the system remains vulnerable to flash flooding because of climate change and slow-moving fixes to drainage and stormproofing systems.
“The atmosphere is warm and warmer air can take more moisture and then that extra moisture hits a cold front and it’s havoc,” Klaus Jacob, a geophysicist and professor emeritus at Columbia University’s Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, told THE CITY. “Then it pours cats and dogs, and it shows up as street flooding.
“And given the lack of interaction between the city and the MTA, then you get subway flooding.”
Monday’s single-hour downpour of two-plus inches was second only to a September 2021 storm from the remnants of Hurricane Ida, which dumped more than three inches of rain on the city inside of 60 minutes and turned some stations into what Jacob has previously called a “default sewer system.”
“It is now the case that five of the most intense rain storms to New York City’s history have taken place in the last four years,” City Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Rohit Aggarwala said during a Tuesday briefing.
That frequency of extreme weather puts more pressure on fixes to floodproofing the subway.
“The big picture is we need the stormwater-management system to be expanded so we don’t have those geyser-like conditions,” said Lieber, noting that the MTA plans to spend $700 million to defend the subway from stormwater flooding in its 2025-2029 capital plan.
The transit agency’s planned improvements include elevating street-level stairs and vents to help keep water out, adding capacity to more than a dozen subway pump rooms that remove excess water and replacing old or undersized drainage infrastructure.
Lieber said that work is a “particular priority” at stations along Manhattan’s West Side, where riders posted social media images of water pouring down station staircases, out of platform manholes and even into trains.
“That is where you saw the No. 1 train knocked out, the 2 and 3 trains were impacted for a while,” he said. “That’s where you saw a couple of those geyser-like conditions where the city-owned stormwater management system backs up. 
“So we need those investments.”
A DEP report last year estimated that repairs would take up to 20 years of work and cost roughly $30 billion.
‘It’s Here and It’s Urgent’
The head of the Permanent Citizens Advisory Committee to the MTA said the city bears “primary responsibility” to keep the subway from being overwhelmed during storms.
“It’s a team effort, for sure,” said Lisa Daglian, executive director of the advisory group. “But the city is the captain in this case.” 
But the MTA’s extreme-weather preparedness has also come under criticism. 
In the wake of Hurricane Sandy in 2012, the MTA made significant efforts to protect vulnerable parts of the system from storm surge, including erecting storm walls along the Rockaway Line in Queens, elevating critical equipment in stations and tunnels and installing barriers at some station entrances.
A 2023 report from the State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli — which was released on the same day that a raging rainstorm affected service on more than half the lines in the system — flagged the MTA’s readiness for future storms.
Lieber said no trains were stranded and that the MTA has protocols in place to protect riders, with train operators not going into areas where water rises above the third rail and could threaten power. 
An MTA spokesperson declined to address questions about what riders should do when water invades stations or trains.
“We’re going to emphasize safety for riders above all,” Lieber told PIX11.
Jacob, the Columbia professor who warned prior to Hurricane Sandy in 2012 of the subway system’s vulnerability to major weather damage, said stormproofing the subway could be a heavy lift.
“It would, believe it or not, need the governor and the mayor sticking their heads together,” he said. “Good luck.”
City officials pushed back strongly against the characterization that the two sides don’t already work very closely together.
Aggarwala, the DEP commissioner, said his agency and the MTA hold monthly coordinating meetings on resilience planning, adding that the city has cleaned 2.5 miles of sewers near 45 subway stations that have previously flooded.
“We put new infrastructure to protect the Dyckman Street station on the 1 train… and the 103rd Street station on the 6 train and we’ve had a two-year joint project to clear out a lot of construction debris from East Side Access on the site that actually protects Sunnyside Yard from flooding,” he said. “So we work very closely with the MTA.”
MTA officials countered that their planned $700 million in resiliency work from its new plan won’t be enough to stop excess storm runoff from cascading into stations if the city doesn’t improve its sewer system.
A spokesperson for Riders Alliance, a transit advocacy group, said the latest subway flooding is indicative of the urgent threat of climate change.
“It’s here and it’s urgent,” said Danny Pearlstein, the organization’s policy director. “Millions of commutes hinge on bold action to prevent things from getting worse and to protect New Yorkers from extreme rain, dangerous heat and rising tides.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/AP23097820994970-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 15:07:23.821267

(Photo by Emma Davis/ Maine Morning Star)A federal court ruled on Tuesday that the law Maine voters passed in 2024 to set limits on so-called super PACs is unconstitutional — the second time within a few days that challenges to Maine’s voter-backed campaign finance restrictions have prevailed. 
However, in this case, the ruling plays into the ultimate goal of those behind the law. 
Roughly 75%, or 600,000, Maine voters approved this law, which set a $5,000 limit on donations to political action committees that independently spend money to try to support or defeat candidates, commonly referred to as super PACs. It also requires the disclosure of all donors who contribute toward independent expenditures, regardless of amount. 
The ruling in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine by U.S. Magistrate Judge Karen Frink Wolf concluded both constitute violations of the First Amendment.  
The lawsuit, which was filed by two PACs (Dinner Table Action, founded by state Rep. Laurel Libby (R-Auburn) and activist Alex Titcomb, and For Our Future, run by Titcomb) was an expected and welcomed part of the plan of those who introduced the referendum. 
Their hope is to eventually bring the question of the legality of such limits to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
While the plaintiffs view Tuesday’s ruling as an outcome in their favor, those behind the referendum, notably legal scholar Lawrence Lessig who spearheaded it, still have an eye on that path. The state is now expected to appeal, and the ballot question committee also has the option to do so since the court granted them standing as interveners. 
Maine sued over new campaign finance law, but that was supporters’ plan all along

Charles Miller of the Institute for Free Speech, one of the plaintiff’s two attorneys, told Maine Morning Star he believes this decision and another federal court decision on Friday that a law passed by Maine voters in 2023 prohibiting foreign government spending in elections is likely unconstitutional demonstrate that an appeal doesn’t make sense. 
“This, combined with the decision from the First Circuit last week, was very clear that the courts across the country recognize the importance of people being able to engage in election-related speech,” Miller said. 
While the two recent court decisions are topically related, Lessig, a professor at Harvard Law School, told Maine Morning Star they are distinct in key ways. And that no one should be surprised that the district court followed the decisions of all other courts so far.
The district court’s interpretation of the controversial, landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on corporate contributions is wrong, Lessig argues, and constitutes the core question he and other supporters hope will now be addressed in the First Circuit Court of Appeals. 
The bigger picture
The ban on foreign spending in elections deals with limiting the ability of certain entities to spend money in Maine elections. However, Tuesday’s ruling doesn’t involve limits on expenditures, only limits to the contributions to committees that make the expenditures. 
While this may seem like splitting hairs, it is the very distinction in the Supreme Court’s philosophy that Lessig and others behind the Super PAC referendum say makes interpretations of Citizens United v. Federal Election Campaign Act to date flawed. 
“Citizens United forecloses limits on contributions to independent expenditure groups,” Frink Wolf wrote in Tuesday’s decision. 
Since Buckley v. Valeo in 1976, the Supreme Court has allowed contributions to be regulated when there is a risk of “quid pro quo” corruption, essentially a favor for a favor. In the case of elections, if there is a risk someone could be making a donation to a candidate in exchange for a favor, then Congress can regulate that contribution. In 2010, the Supreme Court extended this reasoning to corporations and unions in Citizens United.
Three months later, in SpeechNow.org v. FEC, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld that contributions to PACs cannot be regulated either, as long as the PAC is “independent.” Other lower federal and state courts followed suit but the ruling was never reviewed by the Supreme Court. 
Lessig doesn’t think the Supreme Court will change Citizens United, but he believes the question the Maine referendum raises — whether contributions to a committee that makes independent expenditures can be limited — is not answered in Citizens United.
Under the logic of Citizens United, independent expenditures are uncoordinated and create no risk of quid pro quo corruption, but donations to a committee that makes independent expenditures may or may not be coordinated. Therefore, Lessig said, they create the risk of quid pro quo corruption and can be regulated by Congress. 
Lessig hopes the appeal will be swift so the First Circuit will have an opportunity to take up the question by the fall and issue a decision sometime in the spring. If the court decides in favor of the law, the issue could be in the Supreme Court by the fall of 2026. If the First Circuit rules otherwise, the path to the high court is less direct but still possible, Lessig said. 
“The key thing is just stay tuned,” he said. “I think 600,000 Mainers were correct.”

(Pool photo by Alex Brandon/Getty Images)TOPEKA — Financial consequences of a new Medicaid reimbursement timeline that is part of the president’s spending and tax cut bill may negatively affect patients and nursing homes, a Kansas nursing home leader said.
The reconciliation bill decreased the time period when Medicaid will reimburse medical costs incurred before an individual’s eligibility is confirmed, said Rachel Monger, CEO and president of LeadingAge Kansas, a membership organization of nonprofit providers for elderly care. 
The time period Medicaid will repay expenses dropped from 90 days to 60, she said.

  Rachel Monger, CEO and president of LeadingAge Kansas, is concerned a shortened timeline for Medicaid payments may negatively affect nursing home residents and facilities. (Submitted)

“The 90-day window is a vital safeguard that protects residents and their families from devastating financial burdens when care is needed before a Medicaid application can be completed,” Monger said. “Many residents exceed the 60-day threshold due to common delays like dementia, lack of a legal guardian, or complicated paperwork.”
Like other industry leaders around the country, Monger is tracking Medicaid changes and federal policies that have implications for nursing homes and their residents. One analysis found seven nursing homes in Kansas are at risk of closing, and the CEO of a company that operates some of those facilities says he is worried about the impact of federal changes on his ability to hire workers.
Monger said shortening the window for Medicaid payments could have consequences such as making facilities more hesitant to accept Medicaid-pending residents, which would slow hospital discharges and put a strain on rural health systems. 
“If the window is shortened, care provided beyond 60 days — days 61 to 90 — would go unpaid, leaving families on the hook for thousands or forcing nursing homes to absorb the loss,” Monger said. “Many older adults enter care during a crisis, and a shorter window could lead to delays in care or financial strain for families.” 
KanCare, the state’s Medicaid program, showed in a May 2025 report that 7,519 Medicaid applications were pending approval at the end of May, and 1,047 applications had been pending for longer than 45 days. Monger said KanCare data showed 36% of approved applications used the full 90 days of retroactive coverage. 
Other issues incorporated into the bill won’t have a direct effect, many because they target states that expanded Medicaid, Monger said. For instance, the bill changes the way states can use a provider tax, commonly called a “bed tax” in the nursing home industry, but most changes are for expansion states. 
Kansas leaders did not expand Medicaid, an option that was offered by the federal government as part of the Affordable Care Act. It allowed states to expand the number of people who qualified for Medicaid services. 
“Recent language in the federal budget bill about provider tax rate freezes raised initial concerns, but those fears have been eased,” Monger said.
 
National view
A Brown University analysis of President Donald Trump’s spending and tax cut bill’s effects on nursing homes found facilities with a high percentage of Medicaid residents, low occupancy rates and poor quality ratings were at risk of closure. 
The analysis was done at the request of Democratic U.S. Sens. Chuck Schumer, New York; Mark Warner, Virginia; Jeff Merkley, Oregon; and Ron Wyden, Oregon. 
Vincent Mor, professor of health services at Brown, led the research, and he agreed with Monger’s assessment that Kansas nursing homes will miss some negative impacts from the bill because the state did not expand Medicaid. 
However, the analysis considered all effects of the bill on Medicaid, and Mor said it identified 569 nursing homes nationwide that fit the at-risk criteria — seven in Kansas.


“One of my colleagues wrote a letter about how horrible things are going to be with this new bill,  and he thought that one in four high-risk facilities might close,” Mor said. “I don’t think it’s going to be that high.”
Mor said about 1% to 1.5% of nursing homes per year have been closing on average in recent years, with the exception of the year that money was paid out from the federal government during the COVID-19 pandemic. He believes the closure rate could go to 2% and maybe higher in some communities. 
Another concern as high-risk nursing homes become more vulnerable to closure is increasing need for long-term care facilities for the aging population, Mor said. 
“The oldest Baby Boomer is not quite 80 years old,” he said. “When you hit 80, that’s when the risk of nursing home use goes up, and so we’re right now at a nadir of demand. But that’s going to change very quickly. I don’t think anybody in the Senate or House is actually thinking about demographic trends other than not having enough babies.”
 
Challenges
Scott Hines is CEO of Medicalodges Inc., which owns nearly 30 facilities, most of which are in Kansas. They include Medicalodges Post Acute Care Center in Kansas City, Kansas, and Medicalodges Pittsburg, both on Mor’s list of nursing homes at risk of closing. The company no longer owns Medicalodges Jackson County, which also was on Mor’s list.
When any of the company’s facilities receive low scores on one of the factors tracked by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Hines said, a plan is created to address the issue. 
“We’re continuously monitoring our five-star rating, our federal quality metrics,” he said. “Every building’s a little different, so we attack one piece at a time. If one building’s really getting hit hard on their metrics around antipsychotics, then we create separate quality initiatives for those facilities to really attack the antipsychotics use.”
The antipsychotics measure tracks the number of long-term stay patients who received an antipsychotic. The national average is 14.5% while Kansas’ average is 17.3%. Other measures include re-hospitalizations, referring to the percent of short-stay residents who were re-hospitalized after a nursing home admission. 
“We really just look at what are the components that are driving those quality metrics down, and create performance enhancement projects with each of those facilities,” Hines said, adding the company has a team that focuses on quality metrics. 
“They go in and do in-depth work with each of those buildings, and unfortunately, none of those quality metrics move overnight, or they’re all fairly long-term metrics,” he said. “A lot of the data that CMS uses to calculate those metrics is fairly dated.”
The data currently on the CMS website is collected during different time periods, depending on the metric. The date ranges are from 2023 through 2024. 
In the two Medicalodges facilities on Mor’s list still owned by the company, both had an overall rating of one star, primarily because of health inspections. They had four-star ratings on staffing and quality measures tracked by CMS. 
Hines, like most leaders in his industry, is closely watching the Medicaid changes coming from the feds. One of his biggest concerns is workforce and how any constrictions of Medicaid payments may affect his ability to hire qualified staff, especially in rural markets where most of Medicalodges facilities are located.
There are difficulties hiring nurses and certified nursing assistants, he said, as well as finding people to work in housekeeping or dietary positions. 
“It just seems like staffing challenges are pretty much across the board, and some of that is wage based, and which is probably how Medicaid components really tie in,” he said. “As they restrict our Medicaid payments, or put any initiatives in that would reduce those payments over time, then that’s just less resources we have to try to recruit and retain the right staff.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 10:07:25.735424

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota school districts are waiting on over $74 million in federal education funding after the U.S. Department of Education failed to provide states with information about their grant awards by July 1. 
On Monday, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison joined a lawsuit with 22 other state attorneys general suing to unblock the funds.
The withheld funds are part of federal education grants known as title grants. Although Title I, the largest of the federal grants, is not affected, the fed’s move does impact parts of Titles II, III and IV. 
Minneapolis Public Schools, the state’s fourth largest school district, said in a statement that it is still assessing the potential impact. The statement says about $4.5 million is being withheld from the district, whose annual operating budget is roughly $725 million.
St. Paul Public Schools has had $7.2 million in funding held back. The district, whose annual budget is about $750 million, has imposed a hiring freeze while it sorts out the impact. 
Tom Sager, head of finance for St. Paul Public Schools, said in an interview that the district is not currently planning to make any changes to its programs or services for next school year. He said the district maintains reserve funds and will use these to pay for services typically covered by the withheld funds.
“School districts’ budgets are already stretched and every dollar does matter in terms of program delivery and opportunities for students,” Sager said.
Sager estimates that about 20,000 or more students in St. Paul Public Schools are entitled to the services the withheld funding pays for, because they qualify as low-income or English learners. The federal funds also allow the district to allocate its unrestricted state and local funds to things that affect all students, like lowering class sizes, he said.
In St. Paul, Sager estimates the federal funds pay for up to 60 employees out of around 6,000 district employees.



The Minnesota Department of Education has not provided school districts with guidance about how to handle the withheld funding, according to Sager. 
Willie Jett, the state commissioner of the Department of Education, sent a letter to Secretary of Education Linda McMahon on June 26, asking for the funding to be released before the July 1 deadline. On July 3, a statement from the federal Office of Management and Budget said the funds were being withheld because districts were using the money in ways contrary to the administration’s agenda.
The amount of the grants is determined by formulas that were most recently approved by Congress and President Trump in March 2025 as part of a continuing resolution to fund the federal government. Under current law, the executive branch does not have legal authority to cancel appropriations made by Congress. 
(The Supreme Court ruled in a different Department of Education case this week that the Trump administration, for now, can proceed with mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the U.S. Department of Education ordered earlier this year, but the grant funding issue has not been adjudicated yet.) 
Districts receive funding based on a mixture of factors including enrollment, poverty level and number of students learning English.
School districts can spend the funds in several ways. Some of the uses include teacher professional development; class size reductions; improving academic outcomes; after school programs; providing services for students learning English; as well as providing services for students whose parents work in seasonal jobs. 
The impact of the funding is not just on public school districts. A portion of the withheld funds, known as Title IV part B, is also used by non-public schools, faith-based organizations and community organizations to provide services for children outside of the school day. And some of the funding for adult basic education funds programs at community colleges. 
Minnesota’s largest school districts are missing out on the most funding, according to data from New America, a think tank. About one quarter of the funding withheld from Minnesota school districts is owed to just three districts: Anoka-Hennepin Public Schools, St. Paul and Minneapolis, which are the largest, second and fourth largest districts in the state, respectively.
Although the withheld funding makes up a small percentage of the overall budgets for the impacted districts, educators fear that this is just the start, while also noting the constitutional question at play. 
“There’s also a bigger picture here,” Sager said. “Congress controls these funds. And then they’re withheld (by Trump). There’s a concern about the process of that, too. We’re focused on students and their families, but that’s another element as a citizen.”
Small districts are at risk, too: Some that lose the most funding per pupil are rural districts with relatively few students. This is because some of the title grants provide a minimum amount per school district, not just per pupil amounts.
Faribault Public Schools could lose as much as $300,000. In a statement, Jamie Bente, the superintendent, said the district would have to make cuts or shift money to backfill: “Either of which would have an impact on our students, our staff, or both,” Bente said. 
Federal money accounts for about 10% of funding for public education in Minnesota. With the state facing a multibillion-dollar budget deficit in the next biennium, and schools already making significant cutbacks, districts will struggle to replace the lost federal money with state and  local revenue. 
Minnesota school districts must have a board-approved balanced budget in place by July 1, the start of their fiscal year. Unless the funds are released soon, school districts face the prospect of re-working the budgets they just approved to account for the lost funding.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-03-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 10:07:25.735424

July 1, 2025 | Photo by Kyle Davidson/ Michigan AdvanceHopes for a potential budget deal were dashed this week as the Michigan House of Representatives and the Michigan Senate opted not to hold session on Tuesday, with no real target deadline in sight.
The Michigan Legislature failed to reach a budget deal by its self-imposed July 1 deadline, and both chambers have pointed fingers at one another as to why that couldn’t happen. 
For the state Senate’s part, the chamber passed a full budget funding the government, as well as its K-12 and higher education budgets, in May, teeing up the House to do the same. However, the Senate has not issued a full funding plan for fixing Michigan roads.
The House, with some buy-in from Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, released its roads plan and passed a K-12 budget, but has yet to pass a full budget. Members of the lower chamber have said they were waiting on the federal budget to pass and be signed by President Donald Trump in order to know the full effect on the state budget.
Still, both chambers had the opportunity to meet the July 1 deadline but did not, with the Senate packing it up early on July 1 and the House going late into the evening. The House ended the night without netting enough bipartisan support to pass amendments to the Senate’s education budget.
Since then, House Republicans blamed their Senate Democratic colleagues for not being serious about road funding, while the Democrats in the upper chamber said the same about their brethren in the House on the full budget.
In an interview with Michigan Advance on Friday, state Sen. Sarah Anthony (D-Lansing), chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said that although the federal budget has passed, the House has still not been communicative about its plans to fund the rest of state government.
“They have thrown out very, very expensive tax proposals. Income tax relief, an over $100 million Public Safety Trust Fund proposal, very expensive proposals. But yet, you’ve got to show the whole picture,” Anthony said. “It has been frustrating to wait while they contemplate this federal budget. Well, you know what? Now we’re here. We are now at a place where the clock is ticking and it’s time for us to start having real conversations.”
As to the holes created by the federal government’s tax and spending cut plan, which was signed into law by Trump on July 4, Anthony said 40% of the state’s budget comes from federal funding, including Michigan’s Medicaid program, which provides one in four Michigan residents with vital health care.
On the Fourth of July, Trump signs his ‘big, beautiful bill’ into law

Approximately 1.5 million people in Michigan rely on SNAP food assistance benefits, Anthony added, and those two components in the federal budget combined would set Michigan up for a $2 billion deficit. 
“It is critical for us to look at this year’s budget in a way that we’ve never looked at any budget before in recent history because of the impact on social services,” Anthony said. “Things that provide food and health care to people. … Budgets are moral documents, and so, if we’re looking at this moment as a way to invest in children and senior citizens and our low income families, and what they need to survive, our budget would in no way be able to fill every single gap that this federal bill has created in our state.”
With what precious resources Michigan has, Anthony said her priority is to try and safeguard families from those cuts to the highest degree possible.
One of the biggest frustrations with her House counterparts, thus far, is the fact that the Senate can’t negotiate against a House budget bill that doesn’t exist on paper.
“I can’t punch at air,” Anthony said. “We can’t dissect invisible numbers and start to look at proposals, not based on a political lens, but through a practical lens. You can tell me about big expensive concepts that your caucus wants to contemplate, but if the balance sheet doesn’t add up, well, we can’t even start working on those pieces.”
In contrast, Anthony said the Senate passed what it considered a fiscally responsible and balanced budget, which included things like universal school meals and community college guarantees, and grant programs for small businesses and farmers so they have some relief from Trump’s tariff moves.
“We put it all on the table,” Anthony said. “We take the criticism and the praise, but we built a budget … contemplating what we assumed would be the impact of some of these pretty dangerous federal cuts. The most frustrating part about this year has been not having a willing and serious partner in the House Republicans.”
Several attempts were made by Michigan Advance to speak with state Rep. Ann Bollin (R-Brighton), chair of the House Appropriations Committee, but were unsuccessful.

The situation may seem like one of the unintended consequences of divided government, but Anthony said the state has seen divided government before.
“This isn’t anything new,” Anthony said. “We need more reasonable actors at the table.”
As for the proposals she’s found common ground with her House colleagues, Anthony said prioritizing disaster relief was one area of agreement. She said the Senate budget includes emergency reserves for local infrastructure in order to prepare for and respond to local disasters. The House made similar moves related to the dangerous ice storms that occurred earlier this year.
Anthony said those areas are not partisan, and that the impact of climate change on Michigan was clear.
“It’s only going to get worse,” she said. “So that seems like an area of alignment, that if we came together, we could find real relief for local governments and for residents.”
Although it may be expensive, Anthony said public safety was also an area of agreement. She said the two chambers’ proposals look a little different, with the Senate opting for a CARES fund, which would add money for community violence prevention and law enforcement, but also first-responders like emergency medical services and firefighters.
School accountability was also top of mind for both chambers, Anthony said.
“It’s one of the things that not only the House and Senate, but also the administration, are starting to look at [with] ways that we can embed smarter proposals in the way we fund schools,” Anthony said. “It’s not just about pouring money in, it’s about making sure that you’re getting a return on investment and prioritizing those dollars. … I think there’s plenty that we can actually do together.”
That said, a new target date for a deal is yet to be determined. Although some have said that late August could be a reasonable target, Anthony said conversations were still ongoing and that the plane remained up in the air.
“We haven’t set a specific date, but I think that, at least from my perspective, we want to get something done before school starts,” Anthony said. “That is a very reasonable way for us to provide the certainty for our schools that they really respect and deserve.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_3905-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 10:07:25.735424

David Valadao, whose deciding vote earlier this month pushed President Donald Trump’s policy agenda through Congress, endangering health care for millions.","In summary
Jasmeet Bains, a doctor who represents Kern County in the state Assembly, becomes the latest Democrat and likely frontrunner in the race against Republican Rep. David Valadao, whose deciding vote earlier this month pushed President Donald Trump’s policy agenda through Congress, endangering health care for millions. 


A moderate Democratic state lawmaker and practicing physician announced Wednesday that she will seek to topple Central Valley Republican Rep. David Valadao next November in a closely watched congressional district that Democrats hope to win on their quest to take back the House.
Dr. Jasmeet Bains, a Bakersfield assemblymember, hopes to harness voter outrage at Valadao’s decision to support President Donald Trump’s sweeping domestic policy bill, which experts say could strip health insurance from millions of low-income Californians. Nearly 290,000 residents in his own district are at risk of losing coverage, according to the California Budget and Policy Center.
“That vote was really a betrayal,” Bains said in an interview with CalMatters. “I did not envision ever running for Congress. But this is a matter of a doctor upholding her Hippocratic Oath that she took to protect her patients.”
Valadao, who has represented the Central Valley in Congress for 10 of the last 12 years, repeatedly asserted this year that he would not support any measure that would harm recipients of Medi-Cal, California’s version of Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income patients and those with disabilities. He even released a statement a week before the vote indicating he would move to block the U.S. Senate’s version of the bill if it came back to the House. 
Yet on July 2, and each time the bill came before him, Valadao cast an “aye” vote. More than two-thirds of the residents in Valadao’s Central Valley district, which includes parts of King’s, Tulare and Kern Counties, rely on Medi-Cal for their health insurance.
Bains, a moderate Democrat known for sometimes opposing her own party in the Legislature, has for months dropped strong hints that she might take on the five-term congressmember in the swing district. In May, she starred in an ad campaign funded by SEIU California that urged viewers to call Valadao and tell him to vote against the GOP megabill. And political insiders interpreted a social media post shortly after the House sent the bill to Trump as an inevitable sign that she would jump into the race. 
“My community overwhelmingly elected me to office to fight for them because they know I am not afraid to go to any length to protect them,” Bains wrote on X the day after the megabill passed. “It might be time to call in the doctor!”
She joins Randy Villegas, a Visalia school board trustee and college professor, as the only two declared challengers in the race so far. Former Assemblymember Rudy Salas, who ran and lost against Valadao in 2022 and 2024, filed paperwork to run in 2026, although he has not announced his candidacy and his campaign raised less than $60 in the most recent quarter. Clovis Democrat Eric Garcia, a disabled Marine veteran whose three previous runs ended with losses in the primary, also filed a statement of candidacy on Tuesday.
Bains said several patients at her family clinic have encouraged her to run to “do something” about the rising costs of health care and the lack of access to physicians. In the Assembly, she spearheaded an effort to bring a University of California medical campus to her district. She secured $8 million in state funding for a local task force to combat the spread of fentanyl, a cause she has championed as a doctor specializing in addiction treatment. 
All eyes are on Valadao’s seat
Valadao has only lost his seat once, as part of the 2018 “blue wave” where Democrats rode a wave of voter discontent with the first Trump administration to reclaim control of the House, highlighting the GOP’s botched effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. 
Rep. David Valadao voted for Trump’s megabill that cuts funding for Medicaid, despite his district’s reliance on the health care program for low-income and disabled people. He is seen at the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., on March 17, 2021. Photo by Graeme Sloan, Sipa USA via Reuters
After the vote, he defended his support for the megabill as “not an easy decision” and said he still had concerns about how certain aspects would be implemented. 
“Ultimately, I voted for this bill because it does preserve the Medicaid program for its intended recipients – children, pregnant women, the disabled, and elderly,” Valadao wrote. “No piece of legislation is perfect.” 
Since first winning her Assembly seat in 2022, Bains has earned a reputation as a moderate who frequently breaks ranks with her party. She was the lone Democrat to vote against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s proposal to penalize oil companies that exceed a certain profit margin set by state regulators. As punishment, former Speaker Anthony Rendon temporarily stripped Bains of her post on the Business and Professions Committee, a desirable committee. 
“My constituents have seen me take on my party when it comes to having their back,” Bains said, emphasizing that she often pushes back on issues of affordability. “I could not believe that there was someone that was representing this district that could not do the same.”

The daughter of Indian immigrants, Bains grew up in Delano and returned to the Central Valley after graduating from the Illinois Institute of Technology. As the Great Recession hit and friends and neighbors lost their jobs and health care, Bains quit her job at her father’s Chevrolet dealership in Taft to pursue medical school in Antigua. 
She returned to Kern County for her residency and still sees patients on the weekends. In April she showed up to a Business and Professions Committee hearing dressed in scrubs after working a late night at the clinic.  
Before she has the chance to take on Valadao though, both will need to prevail in the June primary. 
‘I hoped we would have just one candidate’
Villegas leans further left than Bains and has aligned himself with the Working Families Party. While he has resisted the label of “progressive” in favor of “economic populist,” some strategists fear he might be too liberal for the Central Valley. Since launching his campaign in mid-April, Villegas has so far raised more than $230,000.
Local Democratic leaders have said Bains will likely be the front runner to challenge Valadao, given her name recognition as an assemblymember and doctor in an election cycle that will likely be dominated by health care. 
But the local Democratic Party chairs in Kern, Kings and Tulare caution that Bains is in no way a shoo-in, especially since she has positioned herself as a political outsider who bucks party leadership. 
Cathleen Jorgensen, who chairs the Kings County Democrats, said she has not been contacted by Bains or her team, a “troubling” sign since Villegas has made himself widely available. Jorgensen said she wished the party could present a united front behind a single candidate from now through next November, rather than pit multiple contenders against each other in a primary. 
“I’m concerned that it might become negative,” said Jorgensen, who has been impressed with Villegas. “I really had hoped that maybe we would have just one candidate.”
Christian Romo, chair of the Kern County Democrats, warned that while health care might be the current hot political topic, much could change between now and June 2. Running as a single-issue candidate, as Bains plans to do, is a risky bet and will require that voters remember Valadao’s vote for the megabill. That could be challenging, especially since the most severe changes to Medi-Cal won’t happen until after November 2026. 
“If we don’t keep that momentum, if we don’t keep reminding people that you’re going to lose health insurance, you’re going to lose your food assistance, you’re going to lose your veterans’ benefits and services that we desperately depend on,” Romo said, “then I don’t see us winning.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/051624-Suspense-File-FG-CM-23.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-16 09:10:28.051758

Tucked inside the sweeping budget bill that President Donald Trump signed earlier this month is a provision to slash the amount of money medical school students can borrow in federal loans. While the new rule will directly affect medical students, it could also have substantial impacts on Californians across the state seeking medical care.
As CalMatters’ Mikhail Zinshteyn and Kristen Hwang explain, starting July 1, 2026, the cap for federal debt professional degree students can incur will be $50,000 annually and $257,000 for the life of a student’s college journey, including undergraduate debt. Grad PLUS loans, a type of federal student aid for graduate students, will also be eliminated. 
The new law will affect all graduate programs, but since medical school typically requires more than $300,000 for tuition, housing and other expenses — which can take decades to repay — many are likely to turn to private loans. Private loans have fewer protections, can charge higher interest rates and don’t offer loan forgiveness.

Calvin Yang, a rising senior at UC Berkeley who wants to attend medical school: “It’s frustrating to see restrictions on our ability to simply want to pursue an education in order to help the world, right? Long COVID persists. Mental health remains a major issue, diabetes, obesity — those all require medical professionals.”

Because the law creates a higher financial barrier for students to attend medical school, particularly for low-income students, experts argue that the pool of prospective doctors would not only shrink, it would also become less diverse.
That’s a problem for California, which like the rest of the country has a shortage of primary care physicians. In addition to maternity wards and rural hospitals closing across the state, California’s Central Coast, Central Valley and Southern Border are projected to have the most severe physician shortages. 

Dr. Mahima Iyengar, a medical resident at the Los Angeles General Medical Center: “We want a diverse group of people taking care of patients, because we know that patients have better outcomes from providers that understand where they’ve come from.”

New challenger for vulnerable CA Republican

Assemblymember Jasmeet Bains is eyeing a bid for Congress. The Bakersfield Democrat and physician announced today that she is running to replace Republican Rep. David Valadao next November, reports CalMatters’ Maya C. Miller.
Bains was elected to the Assembly in 2022 and has garnered a reputation as a moderate who sometimes breaks ranks with her party. As the lone Democrat who voted against a 2023 law backed by Gov. Gavin Newsom to penalize oil companies for alleged price gouging, Bains was temporarily stripped of a committee post by the Assembly speaker at the time.
She will challenge an incumbent who has represented the San Joaquin Valley in Congress for 10 of the last 12 years. Before Trump signed the federal budget bill, Valadao repeatedly pledged that he would not support any measure that would harm Medi-Cal recipients. But each time the measure came before him, Valadao voted to advance the bill.
More than two-thirds of Valadao’s district, which includes parts of Kings, Tulare and Kern counties, are on Medi-Cal. Together with his eight other California GOP colleagues in the House, they represent 2.5 million Medi-Cal enrollees.

Ask a chatbot, miss a mentor

Could students relying on chatbots to assist with their assignments be missing out on human social connections that could have proven valuable? Some education experts think so, writes CalMatters’ Tara García Mathewson.
Chatbots powered by artificial intelligence including ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude can be useful for students to quickly generate information on study topics, draft essay outlines or serve as a starting point for career advice. But for every chatbot query they seek, it could mean one fewer meaningful interaction with a classmate, professor, tutor or others who could have offered students deeper insight.

Julia Freeland-Fisher, director of education at the Clayton Christensen Institute, a nonprofit research organization: “Over time, that means students have fewer and fewer people in their corner who can help them in other moments of struggle, who can help them in ways a bot might not be capable of.”

In a study published in March by the MIT Media Lab and OpenAI, researchers found that frequent users of ChatGPT were more likely to be lonely and isolated from human interaction. But by nurturing human connections, experts say, students can expand their social network and build social capital — forging relationships with others who could end up being a good friend, business partner or job lead.

(Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)Federal funds for adult education services were among those blocked by the Trump administration on July 1, causing immediate cuts to Alaska adult education and workforce development programs and staff layoffs.
The U.S. Department of Education has withheld more than $6 billion in congressionally approved grants for education, including over $629 million for adult education basic grants, and more than $85 million in adult integrated English literacy and civics education grants. The administration has said that it’s withholding the federal funding to review the grant programs to ensure they align with the Republican president’s priorities. 
Adult education can range from classes that help adults learn basic literacy to programs that assist students in gaining certificates equivalent to high school diplomas, and can teach skills that are essential to performing certain jobs. 
Alaska had over $1.1 million allocated as part of an adult education basic grant, according to the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development, which administers the grants. A department spokesperson said on Tuesday the grant amounts for English literacy and civics education this year were not available, but the state received more than $99,600 last year. 
The withheld funds means immediate cuts to services for Alaska adult learners and staff layoffs, according to grant recipients.
“We were definitely blindsided,” said Lucie Magrath, executive director of the Literacy Council of Alaska, a Fairbanks-based nonprofit that provides adult education programs, including adult literacy, English language learning, civics and General Educational Development, or GED, preparation classes. 
Magrath said an estimated $180,000 in federal funding, or over half of their budget, was impounded, causing immediate cuts to services and staff layoffs. While the organization did not identify the number of layoffs in an interview last week, the Fairbanks Daily News-Miner has since reported that there were five layoffs. 
“So we are having to make some pretty drastic decisions with staffing and programming,” she said in a phone interview on Thursday. “We likely will not be able to serve nearly as many people this year, and we’re making staffing cuts right now.”
The organization provides in-person and virtual instruction and mentoring to adult learners in Fairbanks, as well as in villages in the Interior and Western Alaska, stretching from the Yukon Flats to the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta. 
They also have a workforce development program, the Pathways Program, serving youths and young adults ages 16 to 24, and run the used bookstore Forget-Me-Not Books in Fairbanks, which provides revenues for its programs, jobs training and employment. 
Shelby Cooke is the assistant executive director of the Literacy Council of Alaska, and said it’s difficult to fill such a large funding gap, especially on such short notice, and Alaskans will be impacted. 
“The real detriment is to our students and Alaskans who need that GED credential to go to work, or maybe they’re a super-skilled person in their native tongue, but they need enough English to be able to navigate a job interview,” she said. “Those are the folks that are suffering, and in turn, our economy suffers too.”
Magrath said some programs will be suspended immediately. It’s possible that these suspensions will be temporary, as her organization figures out its next steps. “We’re looking at restructuring some of our programs just to be able to use the resources that we have to the maximum impact for our community and our students,” she said. “So we have a lot to figure out right now.”
Southeast Regional Resource Center, a nonprofit educational services agency that provides a variety of services statewide, including adult education, English language learning and workforce development programs. In addition, SERRC provides educational and business services to school districts, including special education programs, human resources and grant administration. 
“We do have some state funds, and so we’ve had to modify our budget just off what we know we have for funding — for state funds — and we are looking at having to reduce our staffing,” said Chris Reitan, its executive director, in a phone interview Thursday. He said the organization is looking at cutting at least two staff positions and a few part-time positions. “So we are concerned about the ability to have the same level of impact.”
Reitan said the federal funding freeze withheld over $86,600 for adult education programs in Southeast Alaska, and over $64,000 in the Aleutians region.











Adult education provides a kind of a lifeline for Alaskans seeking to improve their lives, and it also helps strengthen our state's workforce.


– Chris Reitan, executive director, SERRC



	He said SERRC’s program served 112 students last year in the areas of GED support, English language learning and workforce development across the state. 
“Number one, adult education provides a kind of a lifeline for Alaskans seeking to improve their lives, and it also helps strengthen our state’s workforce,” he said, and will have an immediate impact on adult learners, “which then could immediately impact their ability in regards to getting good-paying jobs, their ability to provide for their families, their ability to contribute to their local communities.” 
He added: “I see this as being a significant impact across the state, in regards to our citizens being able to have the opportunity to better themselves.” 
SERRC and the Literacy Council of Alaska are two of 14 adult education programs across the state with grant funding administered by the Alaska Department of Labor and Workforce Development. A department spokesperson, Adam Weinert, said by email that the department has continued to award available state matching funds for the programs, totaling more than $1.9 million. 
“Sub-grantees were informed that we were moving forward at this time with state funding only,”  Weinert said of the programs. “Once federal funding is released, we will move forward with a budget modification to provide for the federal funding.”
The full impact of how the freeze will affect some programs in the long term remains unclear. 
The University of Alaska system has several adult education programs, funded in part by federal funds, as well as state and local funding. Jonathan Taylor, the university’s director of communications, said by email Monday that “discussions are ongoing” around funding but those programs are scheduled to continue.
Taylor said at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, the Bristol Bay Adult Education program will start up in August with funding from Bristol Bay Economic Development Corp.
Within the University of Alaska Anchorage, there are adult education programs at Kodiak College, serving the Kodiak Island Borough; Kenai Peninsula College, serving the Soldotna, Homer and Seward regions; and Prince William Sound College, serving the Valdez, Cordova and Copper Basin regions. 
“We have received assurances that all three will receive some sort of funding this year,” Taylor said. “To our knowledge, the state will initiate these awards using either state funding or federal funding it has access to. If additional Federal Funds become available, the state will amend the agreements to make up to the original intended funding amount. Currently, this is an active endeavor and ongoing discussion with the state.”

More than half of the states have created school policies to define artificial intelligence, develop best practices for using AI systems and more, according to a report from AI for Education, an advocacy group that provides AI literacy training for educators.
Despite efforts by the Trump administration to loosen federal and state AI rules in hopes of boosting innovation, teachers and students need a lot of state-level guidance for navigating the fast-moving technology, said Amanda Bickerstaff, the CEO and co-founder of AI for Education.
“What most people think about when it comes to AI adoption in the schools is academic integrity,” she said. “One of the biggest concerns that we’ve seen — and one of the reasons why there’s been a push towards AI guidance, both at the district and state level — is to provide some safety guidelines around responsible use and to create opportunities for people to know what is appropriate.”
North Carolina, which last year became one of the first states to issue AI guidance for schools, set out to study and define generative artificial intelligence for potential uses in the classroom. The policy also includes resources for students and teachers interested in learning how to interact with AI models successfully.
In addition to classroom guidance, some states emphasize ethical considerations for certain AI models. Following Georgia’s initial framework in January, the state shared additional guidance in June outlining ethical principles educators should consider before adopting the technology.
This year, Maine, Missouri, Nevada and New Mexico also released guidelines for AI in schools.
In the absence of regulations at the federal level, states are filling a critical gap, said Maddy Dwyer, a policy analyst for the Equity in Civic Technology team at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit working to advance civil rights in the digital age.
While most state AI guidance for schools focuses on the potential benefits, risks and need for human oversight, Dwyer wrote in a recent blog post that many of the frameworks are missing out on critical AI topics, such as community engagement and deepfakes, or manipulated photos and videos.
“I think that states being able to fill the gap that is currently there is a critical piece to making sure that the use of AI is serving kids and their needs, and enhancing their educational experiences rather than detracting from them,” she said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1492420635-scaled-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 09:10:28.051758

Chatbots may give students quick answers when they have questions, but they won’t help students form relationships that matter for college and life success.


Students don’t have the same incentives to talk to their professors — or even their classmates — anymore. Chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini and Claude have given them a new path to self-sufficiency. Instead of asking a professor for help on a paper topic, students can go to a chatbot. Instead of forming a study group, students can ask AI for help. These chatbots give them quick responses, on their own timeline. 
For students juggling school, work and family responsibilities, that ease can seem like a lifesaver. And maybe turning to a chatbot for homework help here and there isn’t such a big deal in isolation. But every time a student decides to ask a question of a chatbot instead of a professor or peer or tutor, that’s one fewer opportunity to build or strengthen a relationship, and the human connections students make on campus are among the most important benefits of college. 
Julia Freeland-Fisher studies how technology can help or hinder student success at the Clayton Christensen Institute. She said the consequences of turning to chatbots for help can compound.
“Over time, that means students have fewer and fewer people in their corner who can help them in other moments of struggle, who can help them in ways a bot might not be capable of,” she said. 
As colleges further embed ChatGPT and other chatbots into campus life, Freeland-Fisher warns lost relationships may become a devastating unintended consequence. 
Asking for help
Christian Alba said he has never turned in an AI-written assignment. Alba, 20, attends College of the Canyons, a large community college north of Los Angeles, where he is studying business and history. And while he hasn’t asked ChatGPT to write any papers for him, he has turned to the technology when a blank page and a blinking cursor seemed overwhelming. He has asked for an outline. He has asked for ideas to get him started on an introduction. He has asked for advice about what to prioritize first. 
“It’s kind of hard to just start something fresh off your mind,” Alba said. “I won’t lie. It’s a helpful tool.” Alba has wondered, though, whether turning to ChatGPT with these sorts of questions represents an overreliance on AI. But Alba, like many others in higher education, worries primarily about AI use as it relates to academic integrity, not social capital. And that’s a problem.
Jean Rhodes, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, has spent decades studying the way college students seek help on campus and how the relationships formed during those interactions end up benefitting the students long-term. Rhodes doesn’t begrudge students integrating chatbots into their workflows, as many of their professors have, but she worries that students will get inferior answers to even simple-sounding questions, like, “how do I change my major?” 
A chatbot might point a student to the registrar’s office, Rhodes said, but had a student asked the question of an advisor, that person may have asked important follow-up questions — why the student wants the change, for example, which could lead to a deeper conversation about a student’s goals and roadblocks. 
“We understand the broader context of students’ lives,” Rhodes said. “They’re smart but they’re not wise, these tools.”
Rhodes and one of her former doctoral students, Sarah Schwartz, created a program called Connected Scholars to help students understand why it’s valuable to talk to professors and have mentors. The program helped them hone their networking skills and understand what people get out of their networks over the course of their lives — namely, social capital. 
Connected Scholars is offered as a semester-long course at U Mass Boston, and a forthcoming paper examines outcomes over the last decade, finding students who take the course are three times more likely to graduate. Over time, Rhodes and her colleagues discovered that the key to the program’s success is getting students past an aversion to asking others for help. 
Students will make a plethora of excuses to avoid asking for help, Rhodes said, ticking off a list of them: “‘I don’t want to stand out,’ ‘I don’t want people to realize I don’t fit in here,’ ‘My culture values independence,’ ‘I shouldn’t reach out,’ ‘I’ll get anxious,’ ‘This person won’t respond.’ If you can get past that and get them to recognize the value of reaching out, it’s pretty amazing what happens.”
Connections are key
Seeking human help doesn’t only leave students with the resolution to a single problem, it gives them a connection to another person. And that person, down the line could become a friend, a mentor or a business partner — a “strong tie,” as social scientists describe their centrality to a person’s network. They could also become a “weak tie” who a student may not see often, but could, importantly, still offer a job lead or crucial social support one day. 
Daniel Chambliss, a retired sociologist from Hamilton College, emphasized the value of relationships in his 2014 book, “How College Works,” co-authored with Christopher Takacs. Over the course of their research, the pair found that the key to a successful college experience boiled down to relationships, specifically two or three close friends and one or two trusted adults. Hamilton College goes out of its way to make sure students can form those relationships, structuring work-study to get students into campus offices and around faculty and staff, making room for students of varying athletic abilities on sports teams, and more.
“We understand the broader context of students’ lives. They’re smart but they’re not wise, these tools.”Jean Rhodes, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston
Chambliss worries that AI-driven chatbots make it too easy to avoid interactions that can lead to important relationships. “We’re suffering epidemic levels of loneliness in America,” he said. “It’s a really major problem, historically speaking. It’s very unusual, and it’s profoundly bad for people.”
As students increasingly turn to artificial intelligence for help and even casual conversation, Chambliss predicted it will make people even more isolated: “It’s one more place where they won’t have a personal relationship.” 
In fact, a recent study by researchers at the MIT Media Lab and OpenAI found that the most frequent users of ChatGPT — power users — were more likely to be lonely and isolated from human interaction. 
“What scares me about that is that Big Tech would like all of us to be power users,” said Freeland-Fisher. “That’s in the fabric of the business model of a technology company.” 
Yesenia Pacheco is preparing to re-enroll in Long Beach City College for her final semester after more than a year off. Last time she was on campus, ChatGPT existed, but it wasn’t widely used. Now she knows she’s returning to a college where ChatGPT is deeply embedded in students’ as well as faculty and staff’s lives, but Pacheco expects she’ll go back to her old habits — going to her professors’ office hours and sticking around after class to ask them questions. She sees the value.
She understands why others might not. Today’s high schoolers, she has noticed, are not used to talking to adults or building mentor-style relationships. At 24, she knows why they matter. 
“A chatbot,” she said, “isn’t going to give you a letter of recommendation.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/050625-TurnitinAICollege-JAH-CM-05.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-16 09:10:28.051758

Two Democratic lawmaker say that the Department of Homeland Security is placing restrictive rules on visiting the Adelanto ICE Processing Center which interferes with their ability to conduct Congressional oversight.


Two Inland Empire Congress members were locked out at the gate of Adelanto ICE Processing Center last week as they attempted to check on constituents held there.
The episode illustrates the obstacles some Democratic lawmakers have experienced trying to observe conditions in ICE detention centers, and what they say are restrictive rules that interfere with Congressional oversight.
Rep. Raul Ruiz, a Palm Desert Democrat, planned to learn if detainees had legal representation and had seen an immigration judge, and whether they had access to healthcare, hygiene and nutrition.
“I had a questionnaire that was prepared with staff and the ACLU and other organizations that asked if they, for example, were allowed a lawyer, phone calls, if they were able to communicate with their loved ones, if they were read their rights,” Ruiz said.
On Monday, July 7, he submitted a request to ICE to tour the facility last Friday with Rep. Norma Torres, an Ontario Democrat. An Instagram post by the two lawmakers showed an earlier message from Torres’ office on July 3, also asking to schedule a visit.
Both requests complied with ICE requirements for 72 hours notice, Ruiz said. But those were courtesy gestures, he said, since federal law doesn’t require advance notice for Congressional oversight visits. When Ruiz and Torres arrived, ICE turned them away.
“They turn around and tell me it’s now seven days notice,” he said. “They keep moving the goal post. We showed up in the hopes that Congressmember Norma Torres and I could enter the facility and speak with an ICE agent and do our jobs. As soon as they saw us they shut the gate and locked it with a chain and a deadbolt.”
The two lawmakers posted a video outside the locked gate, demanding to enter and calling for the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem.
The same day, Ruiz said, Rep. Jay Obernolte, a Hesperia Republican, also scheduled a visit and was allowed inside.
A statement from ICE said Obernolte had provided seven days notice for touring the detention facility, but Ruiz and Torres had not.
“Congressman Raul Ruiz and Congresswoman Norma Torres showed up to Rep. Obernolte’s approved visit; ignoring the established DHS directive regarding visiting ICE facilities,” the agency stated. “They were advised that ICE would be more than happy to accommodate their visit—provided it was scheduled in accordance with DHS policy.”
In a message on X after the visit Friday, Obernolte said he was satisfied with the conditions he observed. He toured the dormitories, cafeteria and recreation facilities, observed the meals and confirmed that detainees had access to legal counsel.
“It’s clear to me that this facility is doing its job: ensuring that detainees are treated humanely – with access to medical care, legal representation, and timely hearings – while helping ICE carry out its mission to enforce our immigration laws,” Obernolte wrote.
An earlier group of Southern California lawmakers who visited the facility in June reported problems with the facility. They found detainees were held “without enough food, clean clothing, the ability to call their families or access to a lawyer,” according to Rep. Judy Chu, a Pasadena Democrat.
Ruiz said the 72 hour notice requirement – and even more so the seven day notice period – makes it hard to tell if the facility is consistently maintaining humane conditions, or has spruced them up in advance of a Congressional visit.
He’ll try to schedule a visit again with at least seven days notice. If he still can’t get access, he’ll consider legal action to challenge the restrictions. The effort to access immigration detention facilities is about due process and also the workings of democracy, Ruiz said.
“When you have an executive branch who’s purposely denying a member of the legislative branch to provide oversight of the executive branch, then you’re starting to go down a very dangerous slippery slope that is contrary to the Constitution and ideas of the founding fathers and three co-equal branches of government,” Ruiz said. “They precisely did not want a single figure to act like a king.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060925-Adelanto-Detention-Center-RV-AP-01-CM.jpg?fit=1024%2C653&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-16 09:10:28.051758

Lauren Ades
Lauren Ades is a rising 11th grader at Pacifica Christian High School in Santa Monica. She previously attended Palisades Charter High School.


A few weeks after the hardest school year of my life let out for summer, I went with my friend Celia back to the Palisades.
It was my first time going there since the January fires. As we drove in along the stretch of Pacific Coast Highway that had recently reopened to the public, I took in an unobstructed ocean view that only a few months earlier had been crowded out by houses. Now the buildings had all burned. Surreal is the only word to describe the experience.
Eventually we made our way up to the bluffs, where the neighborhood gets its name. Me, Celia and other friends from Palisades Charter High always used to hang out there.
I can remember the exact last time we met up at the bluffs. It was winter break, and I’d hugged everyone hard. I was saying goodbye because I was leaving to go on vacation with my family. I didn’t realize how much that goodbye would have to hold. The L.A. fires broke out while we were still traveling. On the flight back, I could make out the flames from my window.
Five of my seven closest friends lost their homes in the Palisades Fire. All of us have been scattered across schools and geography. There’s been a lot of shock to go around. But I think we’ve come out of this closer than ever. The fires really put what mattered into focus. Supporting each other through this time has made us all like family.
Because of COVID, I’d done remote schooling in fifth, sixth and some of seventh grade. For three months after the fire, it was more of that for those of us who decided to stay at Pali High since much of the campus was destroyed or damaged. That was bad. 
But when the school finally re-opened in the old Sears department store in Santa Monica, things became worse. The building was hot and overcrowded, and the adults who were supposed to be helping us made me feel even more stressed out.
At that point, the only thing keeping me at Pali was my friends, but I was miserable. When I told them I was planning to switch schools in the fall to start 11th grade, they understood — a few of them had already moved schools themselves. 
Because some of my closest friends are graduating seniors, I’d gone into this year knowing that things were going to change when they left. The fires just sped up that timeline and made everything so much more extreme.
Even though my friends and I don’t get to see each other every day now, we’ve found ways to stay close. We call, do regular group FaceTimes and try our best to hang out at least once a week in person. It’s made a difference. I know the seniors won’t be able to do that next year because they’ll be in college. But because many of their homes burned down, they plan on coming back more to help their families resettle, so we’ll still see them.

I’ve noticed changes in all of us since the fires. Once you experience loss like this, you get a different outlook on life. My guy friends talk more openly about their feelings. Even the typical “mean” girls, I’d say 90% of them are super nice now. Their houses burned down, too, so they have this whole new perspective. We’ve all just had to rethink what’s important. 
I know I’ve started putting myself out there more. Even though I am more comfortable sticking to my core group of friends, I’ve been hanging out with new people when they ask. I don’t want to take anyone for granted.
While my friends and I don’t always bring up the fires, when we do, we usually talk about memories from before. Like when we all went to the beach and had a bonfire, or this time on the bluffs when my friend Wesley was spinning Celia in circles trying to get her to fly but ended up just dragging her across the floor. That always used to make us laugh. 
Now the memory has become even more precious. I let myself remember it when I returned to the bluffs with Celia in the summer, a time that the fire could never take away.

Citizens did, too",Levi Sumagaysay,,,,,https://calmatters.org/economy/2025/07/immigration-raids-california-jobs/,A new report from UC Merced shows Latino and white people especially lost work after the Trump administration escalated immigration enforcement in L.A.,"In summary
A new report from UC Merced shows Latino and white people especially lost work after the Trump administration escalated immigration enforcement in L.A.


California saw a 3.1% drop in private-sector employment the week immediately after the Trump administration stepped up its immigration raids in the state, according to a new analysis of U.S. Census data. 
UC Merced researchers said the steep drop is second only to the unemployment surge the state experienced during the onset of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, and greater than the immediate decline during the Great Recession in 2007 and 2008.
This appears to be the first analysis of the data from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey from the time when federal agents’ focus on the state became clear in early June, when a raid at a garment factory in downtown Los Angeles preceded weeks of sweeps and unrest. 
The Census Bureau surveys Americans every month about whether they worked the week before. The UC Merced researchers compared survey results from the week of May 11 to the week of June 8, and found that in California, more citizens than non-citizens reported that they did not work the week after that first raid.
The percentage decline would equate to a loss in California of 271,541 jobs from citizens and 193,428 non-citizens, the report said.
“What we know from previous research is that the work that undocumented immigrants or non-citizens do does not exist in a vacuum,” Edward Flores, lead author of the report, told CalMatters. “If there’s disruptions to the work that undocumented immigrants do, it has ripple effects. A slowdown in one industry could cause slowdowns in other industries.”
That’s consistent with other studies that have shown that mass deportations of undocumented workers reduces job opportunities for U.S.-born workers, and studies that have shown the raids’ negative effects on local economies. 
Flores, the faculty director of the UC Merced Community and Labor Center, said he plans to keep tracking and analyzing the Census data and will release similar reports as the federal immigration crackdown continues. He said he expects further escalations of raids because a new federal spending bill substantially increased funding for immigration enforcement. 
The effects of the enforcement may continue to be felt more strongly in California. The report also showed that the number of male citizen workers slightly increased in the rest of the U.S. compared with California during the same periods.  
White and Latino workers in California were the most affected, the researchers found. The number of Latinos in California who reported work between May and June declined 5.6%, while the number of whites in the state who reported work during the same period decreased 5.3%, according to the report. 

The researchers recommended that state policymakers consider “significant action” that may include economic stimulus and disaster relief, similar to what was available during the pandemic. 
Flores pointed out that undocumented immigrants lack a financial safety net, such as access to unemployment benefits. As they continue to lose work, that’s not just a problem for them and their families, but for the state.
“When low-income people spend money, they spend it on things they immediately need, which can stimulate the local economy,” he said. 
Gov. Gavin Newsom has twice vetoed California lawmakers’ attempts to extend unemployment benefits to undocumented workers. In addition, the state just cut Medi-Cal benefits to undocumented immigrants and froze new enrollments because of budget constraints.
When reached for comment, Tara Gallegos, spokesperson for Newsom, said: “Donald Trump’s ruthless and cruel raids have sent families into hiding, impacting our schools, churches, businesses, and workforce — hurting not only California, but the entire nation.” She added that the governor will continue to fight the Trump administration in court; the state has sued Trump over his deployment of Marines to Los Angeles soon after the stepped-up raids.
The California Finance Department closely monitors demographic and economic trends as it shapes state spending plans. When asked to comment about the UC Merced report, Finance Department spokesperson H.D. Palmer pointed to the “downside risk” mentioned in the state’s most recent economic forecast in the revised May budget. It stated that the Trump administration’s large-scale deportation program could “significantly degrade the state’s labor force.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/060825_ICE-Protest-DTLA_JWBH_CM_39.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-16 09:10:28.051758

(Courtesy of the Utah Governor's Office)Utah Gov. Spencer Cox and several lawmakers gathered in a sweltering field next to an old barn in the tiny farm community of Palmyra on Tuesday to announce state officials had recently blocked a Chinese state-owned company from buying land near the Provo Airport. 
Cox said he wanted to make clear that “Utah is reaffirming a strong message that it’s been sending for years.”
“We will not allow adversarial foreign entities to buy up strategic land in our state,” Cox said. 
He announced that “a Chinese state-owned company, tied to the People’s Liberation Army,” which is the military arm of the Chinese Communist Party “tried to purchase land near the Provo Airport very recently.”

Cox described the company, Cirrus Aircraft, as “majority-owned by the Avian Industry Corporation of China, also known as AVIC.” 
“A restricted foreign entity under Utah law with deep military ties to the Chinese government, AVIC makes fighter jets, helicopters and drones for the Chinese military,” he said. “They appear on multiple U.S. federal watch lists and are banned from federal contracts, assistance and benefits due to serious national security concerns.” 
Cirrus Aircraft, which sells private planes, began as a U.S. company based in Wisconsin, according to its website. In 2011, when many U.S. companies were struggling in the wake of the Great Recession, AVIC’s subsidiary China Aviation Industry General Aircraft bought Cirrus for about $210 million, Bloomberg reported in 2023. 
“Cirrus isn’t a military manufacturer — its main products are single-engine planes used by private citizens and charter services — but some of its technology and manufacturing expertise could be valuable to the (People’s Liberation Army),” Bloomberg reported in that 2023 article, attributing “several aviation and Chinese military experts interviewed by Bloomberg.”
That story also noted Cirrus “hasn’t been accused of any wrongdoing … but its parent company is under a great deal of scrutiny,” noting that in 2020 the U.S. began “flagging AVIC as a potential national security threat, imposing sanctions designed to hinder the growth of companies directly connected to China’s military.” 
Cox’s office did not offer many details about what Cirrus had planned to do with the land near the Provo Airport, but the governor said “their proposed investment in Utah was millions of dollars and hundreds of jobs.” 
“And I don’t care,” Cox said. “We are not for sale.”

The governor applauded the Utah Legislature for passing several laws meant to clamp down on “foreign threats” in the state, including HB516, a bill sponsored by Rep. Candice Pierucci, R-Herriman, passed in 2024 that restricts companies controlled by countries including China, Iran, North Korea and Russia from buying land in Utah. It also requires land already owned by those countries to be divested. 
In 2022, Utah universities also began shutting down Confucius institutes after Utah lawmakers raised national security concerns. Pierucci said they were “identified by the State Department and FBI as Chinese propaganda outlets.” 
The blocked land purchase near Provo Airport
The governor’s office referred questions about the blocked land sale to the Department of Public Safety, which lawmakers tasked with maintaining a list of “restricted foreign entities,” creating a process for flagging land purchases by restricted countries, investigating purchases, and training local officials like county recorders to report land conveyances they suspect are prohibited. 
Capt. Tanner Jensen, director of Utah Department of Public Safety’s statewide information and analysis center, told Utah News Dispatch on Tuesday evening that public safety officials were notified of the attempted purchase earlier this year, in February and March, and “efforts were immediately stopped.” 
Jensen said under state law, county recorders are required to notify the Department of Public Safety of “any suspicious activity surrounding foreign land purchase conducted by restricted entities.” In the case of the attempted Cirrus purchase, “the county recorders and the Governor’s Office of Economic Opportunity notified DPS,” he said.










This isn’t just about one deal. It’s about protecting strategic land and ensuring foreign adversaries cannot gain a foothold in our state.


– Utah Gov. Spencer Cox


Jensen said he was not immediately able to provide more information, including how many acres were set to be sold, where specifically the land was located in relation to the Provo Airport, and who was selling the land.  
But he said the potential purchase in proximity of the Provo Airport was concerning because it could have been “strategic, economically” for the Chinese government, “and also strategic in the fact that aviation is a critical infrastructure.” 
“Our federal, state, local law enforcement and homeland security efforts are focused on this type of activity, especially from China and some other nation state actors that are looking to compromise our freedoms and our security here,” Jensen said. “Land purchase is just one of many tactics that we’re concerned about.”
He added that public safety officials are also concerned about “surveillance, security compromises, intellectual property theft, (and) attacks on our democratic process by misinformation.” 
“So this foreign land purchase is just one aspect of it,” he said. “But we do know that it’s a tactic that they use to gain control of our economy, to have influence over how our economy functions, and also gives foreign adversaries the ability to collect additional information on our security efforts here.” 
To Pierucci, the blocked sale showed Utah laws are working. 
“What was exciting about this stop of the transaction next to the Provo Airport was it was a county recorder who caught it, and it was because of the training, a direct result of the legislation that was passed and signed by Gov. Cox,” Pierucci said. 
Susan Sorensen, owner of the fifth-generation family farm in Palmyra, said she offered to host Tuesday’s press conference when she learned the governor’s office was looking for a location. She told Utah News Dispatch she’s never experienced a foreign entity attempting to purchase her land, but she knows first-hand how difficult it can be for small Utah farm owners to keep their land in their family. 
“It’s extremely important that we protect our farmland,” she said.

How much land in Utah is owned by China?
Currently, Cox said it’s “very, very little.” 
He said he wanted to set the record straight, noting that there have been some “really dumb maps that keep floating around the internet” that incorrectly showed “millions of acres of Utah” are owned by the Chinese government. 
According to data recently released by the U.S. The Department of Agriculture, as of Dec. 31, 2023, about 33,000 acres in Utah had been owned by Chinese companies and investors, The Center Square reported. 
Cox said “there are lots of different efforts, including here in Utah,” to categorize land owners and ensure “we don’t have those adversarial entities.” By most estimates, he said around 35,000 to 37,000 acres of land in Utah were owned by the Chinese government. 
He emphasized the words “were owned.” 
“Over the past few months, 35,000 acres of that has been divested and is no longer owned by the Chinese government,” he said. “So now we’re talking about a very, very, very small percentage. We will continue to investigate and we will continue to make sure that we are enforcing the law.” 
Cox said Tuesday’s press conference “isn’t just about one deal.”
“It’s about protecting strategic land and ensuring foreign adversaries cannot gain a foothold in our state,” he said. “Other states might have let this slip through the cracks. Utah didn’t, and won’t.”
As of the end of 2023, U.S. Department of Agriculture data showed about 45.8 million acres in the U.S. — a swath of land that, taken all together, would be larger than Washington state — belonged to foreign entities, The Center Square reported. It’s unclear where that figure stands today. 
According to the governor’s office, other states are interested in Utah’s policies, which have also been “recognized as a national best practice by senior U.S. Department of Defense officials.” It also noted the Association of Defense Communities invited Utah to present at its national installations conference. 
Pierucci said her slate of bills that have taken aim against the Chinese Communist Party’s influence “are far more than policy.”

“They are a declaration that Utah will not be intimidated or infiltrated by authoritarian regimes, and they affirm that we value freedom, transparency and security over short-term economic convenience,” she said. 
Pierucci added that Utah’s efforts have “set an example nationally for how states can stand up to the Chinese Communist Party’s malign interests and safeguard our national security.” 
“National security is no longer the exclusive domain of Washington. It begins here at home, on our farms, in our schools and universities, with county recorders, industry partners and policymakers,” she said. “So let us be clear-eyed and confident. We will not be intimidated by authoritarianism masquerading as progress.” 
She also said there’s more to come from the Utah Legislature, including legislation to “address Utah’s water vulnerabilities” and “put a stop to the CCP’s forced disclosures of our critical minerals in order for our Utah ranchers to sell their products to them.” She said lawmakers will also look to enhance the Department of Public Safety’s “tools and resources” to enforce all of these measures. 
It’s not just about land, Cox said, but also religious freedom
Near the end of Tuesday’s press conference, Cox ended his remarks by also pointing to recent actions by the Chinese government to restrict religious worship, including the closure of multiple congregations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Beijing. 
“These weren’t radical or political gatherings,” he said. “They were peaceful, quiet places of worship, attended by Utahns, American diplomats, and local Chinese believers who followed the law and stayed out of the spotlight.”
The governor said “it’s clear what China is attempting to do here. They’re using the right to worship as leverage.” 
“This is personal for us,” he continued, adding that “Utah’s own story is rooted in the right to worship. Religious liberty is not a bargaining chip. Not for land deals. Not for trade. And not for diplomacy.” 
Utah, he said, will “always stand for the right to worship freely, and we reject any attempt — foreign or domestic — to silence that right through coercion or pressure.” 
Cox said the shutdowns “reflect a growing pattern, not just against Latter-day Saints, but against many faiths and nonprofits with any ties to the West.”
“This is what authoritarianism looks like: pressure abroad, coercion at home, and total disregard for faith and belief,” Cox said. “And it’s why Utahns must remain vigilant. Whether it’s farmland near an airport or quiet congregations abroad, we will continue to stand for liberty, for property rights, for religious freedom, and for the values that make this state and this country great.”

The pair sponsored the state's new funding formula for public schools, the RAISE Act, which is allowing a rural district in northeast Alabama to hire six English Language Learner teachers. (Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Under a new public school funding formula adopted by Alabama earlier this year, a rural school district in northern Alabama is getting almost half of its additional funding for students who are learning to speak English. 
DeKalb County Schools has 12 schools and about 8,400 students, with a sizable number of immigrants or coming from immigrant families. Crossville High School’s population is about 90% English Language learner (ELL), and Collinsville High School’s population is about 70% ELL, according to Rep. Ginny Shaver, R-Leesburg, whose district includes DeKalb County. 
Anna Hairston, director of federal programs for the district, said in an interview the system has already hired two ELL teachers with the nearly $1.4 million the state is allocating to the system for ELL students in fiscal year 2026, which starts in October. Four other positions to help ELL teachers and students are in the hiring process, she said.

“Then we’re also going to move $190,000 out of our local funds, that are currently used for contract retirees, in for EL services,” Hairston said in an interview on July 1.
Erin Brown, the language acquisition coach at the school system, said all six new hires are former students that have come back to serve their community. She said the school has 23 EL teachers, seven of which are bilingual, who all have either a bachelor’s or masters degree in education. There are also 13 auxiliary teachers who have a certificate, from the local community college, to teach ELL students and aid their teachers. 
“They have an understanding of the hurdles that they have to jump through in order to be a bilingual student,” Brown said in an interview Thursday. “So they have that real world experience to be able to share with those students that it can be done.”
Hairston said ELL teachers carry more responsibilities than others, and the biggest challenge is the case load. She said the district is 21% ELL students, and each student has a unique learning plan based on their existing ability.
“We try to instruct in English, but we also try to use first language support as needed, particularly with our newcomers,” Hairston said. “So adding bilingual staff members will continue to alleviate that burden.”
On top of teaching a unique plan to each student, EL teachers also have to collaborate with other teachers in the “normal” curriculum, administration, school counselors and each students’ parents.
“Mostly, the needs of the teachers consist of parental involvement, just getting the parents to become involved in the students’ education,” Brown said. “Also, there isn’t typically curriculum that is produced that goes alongside the mainstream classroom curriculum.”
Brown said while the majority of ELL students speak Spanish, there are different dialects within the language and students that speak Vietnamese and Ukrainian.
“Oftentimes, our students that come with Guatemalan dialects, they actually acquire Spanish first and then English,” she said. “Because they’re so quickly immersed in Spanish, with peers and or family members that have lived here longer. They’ve learned Spanish and so the students become trilingual students simply because of what they’re immersed in.”
The students also take a standardized test to measure their proficiency in the English language. In the 2024-25 school year, there were more than 50,000 ELL students in the state, and 2,670 (5.29%) scored “proficient” on the standardized test, according to the Alabama State Department of Education (ALSDE), about 0.7% higher than the previous school year. 
“A lot of our teachers serve the students for multiple years, and so they become very familiar with family structure, with family tree of who’s kin to who, and who you know who belongs to what family,” Brown said. “They do not migrate out of the area. For the most part, they stay because they’re very family oriented.”
Shaver said in an interview Friday that she is very happy the school system is getting more money for ELL students.
“There are additional things schools have to do for kids that don’t speak English as their first language,” she said. “This will help out tremendously.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Arthur-Orr-Danny-Garrett-Feb-5-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 08:08:01.876881

Now, the Chiefs are exploring a possible stadium across the state line, enticing Missouri politicians to offer the team a public subsidy. (Vaughn Wheat/The Beacon)Jackson County Executive Frank White Jr. has proposed a new path forward for the Chiefs to remain at Arrowhead Stadium.
In a letter sent to Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe on July 8, obtained through a Sunshine Law request by The Beacon, White suggested renewing the same three-eighths-cent sales tax that failed last year — but with a big asterisk.
Under this proposal the Chiefs would only receive one-third of that sales tax revenue — equivalent to one-eighth of a cent — rather than half of the revenue under the current tax. The remaining revenue generated by the tax would support health care and public safety.
White’s proposal follows the recent special session called by Kehoe to, among other things, approve a state funding plan to support potential stadium projects for the Chiefs and Royals. Under the “Show-Me Sports Investment Act,” the state would appropriate some tax revenue generated by new stadium projects to help pay off the bonds used to finance construction.

White, who played for the Royals for 18 years, was one of the most vocal critics of last year’s stadium sales tax proposal that was resoundingly rejected by Jackson County voters. Indeed, some have linked an ongoing recall effort against White to the construction lobby, which was frustrated by his opposition to the Crossroads stadium proposal for the Royals.
“Governor, I’m aware that some have tried to suggest that I’m opposed to any level of public funding for these teams,” he wrote in the letter. “That’s just not true … I believe we owe our residents something better: a balanced approach that protects their interests and secures a stronger future for everyone.”
Here’s what White’s plan would mean for Kansas City.
 A sales tax split three ways

Under last year’s proposal, all of the three-eighths-cent sales tax’s revenue would have been evenly split by the Royals and the Chiefs. The Royals would have effectively gotten three-sixteenths of a cent to help finance a new downtown ballpark, and the Chiefs would have gotten the other three-sixteenths of a cent to upgrade Arrowhead.
The new plan is still a three-eighths-cent sales tax. But it’s divided into thirds, with each recipient getting one-eighth of a cent:

The Chiefs would get one-third of the sales tax revenue to fund maintenance, repairs and improvements to Arrowhead Stadium.
Another third would go to University Health to fund capital improvements. That would help fill some of the gaps left by Trump administration cuts.
Another third would fund improvements and repairs at the historic downtown Jackson County courthouse, as well as the Family Justice Center at 26th and Holmes streets.

 White’s plan would require the Missouri General Assembly to take action — again

There are some hiccups in White’s plan.
Under state law, a sales tax question can be put to voters in order to fund a “capital improvement purpose.”
That’s singular, not plural.
So if Jackson County wanted to put this question to voters, it would need to be three separate ballot questions — one-eighth-cent for the Chiefs, one-eighth-cent for University Health and one-eighth-cent for courthouse and justice center improvements.
White’s letter called that an “impractical path for a unified community plan.”
So he asked Kehoe to support a statutory change that would allow counties to put sales tax questions that fund multiple projects to voters.
Moreover, any sales tax ballot measure likely wouldn’t happen until the next regularly scheduled election in Jackson County, in August 2026.
 What about the Royals?

White’s proposal doesn’t outline any funding for the Royals. But that doesn’t mean he’s opposed to a future proposal focused on the baseball side of things.
Local officials around the metro area are waiting for the Royals to take the next step for a new ballpark.
That includes officials in Jackson County, as well as Clay County and Overland Park.
“I can’t imagine why we would want to take any action until (the Royals) have committed to a site and resources that they’re willing to contribute,” Jackson County Legislator Sean Smith told The Beacon last month. “Until they do something, we’re kind of just, you know, waiting in the wings.”
And White stated as much in his letter.
“I also want to be clear about the Royals: I fully support keeping them in Jackson County,” White wrote. “Since the April 2024 vote, the City of Kansas City has taken the lead on identifying a new site and working with the team, and I’ve respected their desire to do so. At the same time, I’ve made it clear to the Royals that Jackson County is ready to support the City’s efforts and is willing to step back in, should the team present a proposal for us to consider or express interest in reengaging. To date, the Royals have not done so.”
The Royals remain mum.
“We’ve been consistent that we’re exploring all options,” Royals spokesperson Sam Mellinger wrote in an email to The Beacon last month, “and when we have something that’s ready to share we will do it.”

Washington, D.C. has the second largest spike in inventory (+63.6%) followed by Raleigh, N.C. (+56.4%), says the report from the National Association of Realtors. Nationwide, the number of homes for sale is up 28.9%.
Las Vegas Realtors reported last week that at the end of June, 6,992 single-family homes for sale had no offers, a 70% increase from a year ago. The 2,564 condos and townhomes without offers in Southern Nevada account for an 87.6% jump over 2024.
Sales in June were down 7% from a year ago and the average home is staying on the market for more than 30 days, with about 80% selling within 60 days. 
While housing stock is up over last year, it remains well below pre-pandemic levels.  
“It’s been some time since we had this many homes on the market,” says Jeff Crampton, a Las Vegas Realtor, noting that 6,000 to 10,000 properties for sale is a healthy market. 
Two factors, he says, are “keeping buyers on the shelf. One is the interest rates, and the other is the unsettling financial news on our TV every freaking day. Tariffs. No tariffs. War. No war. When people are going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on something, they want certainty.”
Some borrowers are attempting to cushion the blow of higher interest rates by taking on adjustable rate mortgages, which offer a lower rate for an initial period – usually five years – and increase periodically after that. 
The Mortgage Bankers Association reported that for the week ending April 11, 2025, the share of borrowers applying for ARMs rose to its highest level since November 2023.
“Given the jump in rates, more borrowers are opting for the lower initial rates that come with an ARM, with initial fixed rates closer to 6% in our survey last week,” Mike Fratantoni, MBA’s SVP and chief economist, said in a press release.
However, ARMs are riskier than 30-year fixed rate loans, which are set about a point higher.  
Experts warn the market’s woes are a harbinger of economic disarray.  
“Housing will … soon be a full-blown headwind to broader economic growth, adding to the growing list of reasons to be worried about the economy’s prospects later this year and early next,” Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi wrote Monday in posts on X and Linkedin. “Home sales, homebuilding, and even house prices are set to slump unless mortgage rates decline materially from their current near 7% soon. “
President Donald Trump is calling for a decrease in the benchmark interest rate, currently at 4.25% to 4.5%, to 1%, a move economists fear would trigger another set of economic woes, including higher inflation. 
The inflation rate ticked up in June, pushing the annual rate to 2.7%, the highest since February. The likely cause, experts say, is Trump’s tariffs.   
The price is right?
The U.S. housing market has no shortage of would-be buyers, evidenced by a 25% year-to-year increase in purchase applications, HousingWire reports.  While some sellers are holding out for top dollar, many homes are priced right, experts contend.
“Normally, if a listing is priced too high, you’re not getting showings for it,” observes Crampton. “I’ve had 13 showings for one house, and I’ve had 19 showings for another house, but just one offer between them.”
The dearth of offers, he says, is evidence of a lack of confidence among buyers who are not balking at home prices, but at the long term costs of financing.  
Home prices have been “pretty stable so far this year,“ LVR President George Kypreos said in a news release last week, adding the increase in homes for sale “is good for buyers. It should also be prompting sellers to be realistic when pricing their properties.”  Kypreos was not available for an interview. 
The median price of an existing single-family home sold in Southern Nevada in June was $485,000. That’s up 1% from the previous month, up 2.1% from last year, and ties the record set during the first quarter. 
In Washoe County (excluding Incline Village) the median sales price for existing single-family homes was $616,400 in June, up 3.8% from May and 2.7% from last year. Inventory was up 7.7% from May and 46% from a year ago. 
But home prices, which have held up amid sagging sales, “have gone sideways and are set to fall,” projects Zandi of Moody Analytics.
Price reductions last week in Southern Nevada were up 95% over last year, says real estate agent Diane Varney. “We appreciated too quickly during Covid. We’re in a correction. We needed one. ”
Prices, however, remain at record levels. Varney says that’s because the Multiple Listing Service no longer reports seller concessions, resulting in skewed data on sale prices. “If you sell a house for $750,000 and there was a $25,000 to $50,000 concession for repairs, rate buy down, closing costs – anything like that – it’s not going to show up in the sale price at the end of the day.”
Agents, Varney says, get calls from appraisers “all the time” because they need the information to determine the true value of comparable properties. 
Even new home builders, who have bought down interest rates as a means of buoying sales, are giving up, according to Zandi.
“It’s simply too expensive,” he wrote Monday. “A big tell is that many builders are delaying their land purchases from the land banks. New home sales, starts, and completions will soon fall.”
Those who are attempting to sell in the current market are likely facing a life-altering event, such as marriage, divorce, or the addition of a child, according to Crampton and Varney. 
“It’s not ‘I may want to sell.’ It’s not  ‘if I can get my price I’ll sell, otherwise, I’m going to stay here.’ Those players are out of the game,” Varney says of non-motivated sellers.  
Complicating matters, one in five deals is falling out of escrow, she says.  
“With the inventory climbing, buyers see another home that came on the market that’s more attractive, or maybe the rates took a spike, and they cancel,” says Varney. “Buyers right now are real touchy.”",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/housing-vista-getty-1024x684.jpg,,,2025-07-16 08:08:01.876881

,California,2025-07-16 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,Why California’s agricultural industry is at odds over converting land to solar farms,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/california-agricultural-splits-solar-farms/,A conflict in the Imperial Valley offers a window into an increasingly sharp debate within California's $60 billion agricultural sector over what should happen as acreage devoted to crops and livestock shrinks.,"The Imperial Irrigation District, which provides water to farmers in the southeastern corner of California, drew a figurative line in the sand earlier this month, calling for a halt to the conversion of agricultural fields into solar panel farms.
Noting that more than 13,000 acres of fertile land had already been converted, the water district asked the Imperial County Board of Supervisors to protect productive farmland.
“Our identity and economy in the Imperial Valley are rooted in agriculture,” Gina Dockstader, who chairs the district board, said in a statement. “Solar energy has a role in our region’s future, but it cannot come at the cost of our farmland, food supply, or the families who depend on agriculture. This resolution is about protecting our way of life.”
The Imperial Valley conflict is one manifestation of an increasingly sharp debate within California’s $60 billion agricultural sector — the largest of any state — over what should happen as the acreage devoted to crops and livestock shrinks.
The state Department of Conservation says that agricultural lands declined by more than 1.6 million acres between 1984 and 2018, averaging 47,000 acres a year. The most productive land experienced the largest decline. Urbanization — the conversion of fields into homes and businesses — accounted for most of the decline, but residential development has slowed in recent years, contributing to a chronic housing shortage.
Other factors, such as labor shortages, production costs and uncertain water supplies, have created what industry leaders say is a crisis. The Public Policy Institute of California has estimated that the recently imposed limits on tapping underground aquifers to irrigate crops will result in 500,000 acres of farmland being taken out of production.
More recently, President Donald Trump’s imposition of tariffs and a crackdown on undocumented immigrants have put more pressure on the agricultural industry.
As farmers, particularly the larger corporate growers, take land out of production, many believe that their economic salvation lies in solar panel arrays that generate the emission-free electricity that the state wants, as it phases out power fueled by hydrocarbons.
However, that doesn’t sit well with farmers who want to continue production, as the Imperial Irrigation District’s call for a solar moratorium implies.
Like many conflicts, this one has landed in the Capitol in the form of legislation. Assembly Bill 1156 would make it easier for farmers whose lands are contractually obligated to remain open space under the Williamson Act to avoid paying the heavy penalties required by law.
The Williamson Act, enacted six decades ago to slow the sprawl of urban development into farmlands, gives farmers hefty breaks on property taxes on land they maintain as open space. AB 1156 would specifically declare that farmers can replace crops with solar farms without incurring penalties if the owner is experiencing water shortages. The bill is backed by the solar power industry, environmentalists, labor unions and many large farmers.
The California Farm Bureau and family farm groups oppose it, arguing that it will undermine the Williamson Act because almost any farmer can declare a water shortage, given the chronic uncertainty of California water supplies. Emulating the Imperial Irrigation District’s stance, opponents say wholesale conversion of farmland into solar farms will devastate rural communities that depend on agriculture for jobs.
Politically, it’s a David vs. Goliath conflict. AB 1156, carried by Assemblywoman Buffy Wicks, an Oakland Democrat, has been moving briskly through the legislative process. It’s already cleared the Assembly and is likely to hit the Senate floor soon.

Nativism, the idea that government must guard native-born Americans from various threats posed by immigrants, has a long history in the United States.
Today, the Trump administration is citing the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, a restrictive measure written by nativist members of Congress decades ago when fears of communism were rampant, to sharply restrict the rights of noncitizens.
Under this law, also known as the McCarran-Walter Act, federal agencies have arrested and detained noncitizens associated with pro-Palestinian protests, reintroduced immigrant registration requirements, and imposed a new travel ban that affects 19 nations.
Since the 1950s, Congress has removed some of this sprawling federal law’s most discriminatory features, such as racist national origins quotas. But other key provisions remain on the books. Now they are the primary legal basis for some of President Donald Trump’s most controversial immigration crackdowns.
 Foreign policy trumps free speech

In March 2025, the White House invoked the McCarran-Walter Act to justify arresting and deporting Mahmoud Khalil, a legal permanent resident who had participated in pro-Palestinian protests at Columbia University. Officials pointed to Section 237(a)(4)(C) of the law, which states that any “alien whose presence or activities in the United States the Secretary of State has reasonable ground to believe would have potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States is deportable.”
This has been tried only once before. In 1995, the Clinton administration unsuccessfully sought to use the provision to deport a former Mexican official, Mario Ruiz Massieu, to face charges in his homeland for extortion and obstructing a murder investigation. Ruiz Massieu was later indicted in the U.S. on money laundering charges and died by suicide shortly before his arraignment.
The Trump administration cited the same provision to justify detaining Tufts University doctoral student Rumeysa Ozturk in March. Ozturk came under government scrutiny because she co-authored an op-ed in the Tufts student newspaper criticizing the university’s position on the Israel-Gaza war.
Surveillance footage of a terrified Ozturk being arrested by masked Immigration Customs and Enforcement agents on a street in Somerville, Massachusetts, drew criticism from government officials and civil liberties advocates. In response, Secretary of State Marco Rubio alleged that Ozturk had harmed U.S. interests by supporting “movements that are involved in doing things like vandalizing universities, harassing students, taking over buildings, creating a ruckus.”
Khalil and Ozturk both were released after weeks in detention, pending final resolution of their cases. Their lawyers argue that their clients’ treatment violates free speech protections and that the defendants were punished for expressing their political beliefs.
 Monitoring noncitizens

The McCarran-Walter Act also authorizes intrusive registration and tracking requirements for noncitizens who remain in the U.S. for 30 days or longer.
On Jan. 20, 2025, Trump issued an executive order directing the Department of Homeland Security to enforce an “alien registration requirement.” The agency issued a final rule in April requiring all noncitizens over the age of 14 to register and be fingerprinted. Parents or guardians must register noncitizen children under age 14. The rule also requires adult noncitizens to carry “evidence of registration” at all times.
Such policies aren’t new. Noncitizen registration was codified in the Alien Registration Act of 1940, on the eve of U.S. entry into World War II. The law was designed to regulate the foreign-born population and encourage eligible noncitizens to join the U.S. armed forces. Its requirements were written into the McCarran-Walter Act.
After the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the Bush administration created the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which targeted noncitizen males age 16 or older from 25 Muslim-majority countries. It required registrants to submit biometric information, check in regularly with immigration authorities and use specific ports of entry for travel.
The Obama administration suspended this system in 2011 and permanently dismantled it in 2016.
Today, Trump administration officials say they are simply enforcing long-standing legal authority. A federal judge agreed, ruling on April 10 that the Homeland Security Department could require noncitizens to register and carry documentation.
 Travel bans redux

On June 2, Trump announced a new travel ban on foreign nationals from 12 countries, mostly in Africa and the Middle East. The ban draws its authority from the McCarran-Walter Act. Two days later, Trump claimed the same legal discretion to exclude Harvard University’s international students from the U.S.
During his first term, Trump invoked these sections of the law to justify a travel ban on seven predominantly Muslim countries. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld this action in 2018 by a 5-4 vote in Trump v. Hawaii. Writing for the majority, Chief Justice John Roberts stated that the travel ban was well within broad powers over immigration granted to the president under the McCarran-Walter Act. He added that the court had “no view on the soundness of the policy.”
Trump’s new ban is more carefully crafted than earlier versions and more likely to withstand legal challenges. But his efforts to use the McCarren-Walter Act to ban international students from attending Harvard University face stiff legal headwinds.
On May 22, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem notified Harvard officials that the agency was revoking the school’s certification to participate in the Student and Exchange Visitor Program, which grants visas to international students to come to the U.S. In a June 4 proclamation, the White House claimed that foreign students at Harvard had behaved in ways that threatened U.S. national security.
A federal judge in Boston quickly blocked the revocation, holding that it violated core constitutional free speech rights. “The government’s misplaced efforts to control a reputable academic institution and squelch diverse viewpoints seemingly because they are, in some instances, opposed to this administration’s own views, threaten these rights,” wrote Judge Allison D. Burroughs.
The latest step came on July 9, when the Trump administration subpoenaed Harvard for information on its foreign students, including their disciplinary records and involvement in campus protests.
 Broad power over noncitizens

Ironically, congressional sponsors of the McCarran-Walter Act were at odds with the White House when the law was enacted in 1952. They overrode a veto by President Harry S. Truman, who thought the law’s nativist ideas were unfitting for a nation of immigrants and global defender of democracy.
However, the expansive executive powers created by this law have endured largely unaltered over time, through waves of immigration reform.
Now they are a boon to the Trump administration’s ambitious immigration crackdown. It’s a telling reminder that repressive old laws can come back to life – even when they don’t reflect the current views of many Americans.

The newest member, Nash, recused himself from deciding cases until he became familiar with the cases. (Ralph Chapoco/Alabama Reflector)Even though the Alabama Board of Pardons is fully staffed with three members, it will continue to operate as if it is without one member as the new chair gets up to speed.
Gov. Kay Ivey appointed Hal Nash about one week ago, and he said during a hearing on Tuesday he is recusing himself from voting on both parole and pardon applications during a hearing for now.
“I have not had an opportunity to review any of these cases, and therefore, I will not be voting on any of these cases,” Nash said before the board announced its decisions on a set of cases. “It would be extremely unfair to not be prepared in making any decision. Because of that, I will not be voting. I will be observing and getting my feet on the ground so that when I do vote, I will be confident because I have had the opportunity to review all the files.”
Nash added in a conversation after the meeting that he will continue to recuse himself for at least the next few days but has not established a timetable for when he will start to make decisions about pardons and paroles.
“The parole board strives to be fair,” he said.
His delay is consequential for parole applicants, because the verdicts are left to two associate members of the parole board, Darryl Littleton and Gabrelle Simmons. If they disagree on a particular case, the applicants will be denied.
Nash began his tenure as chair on Monday after he was sworn into office.
“As a law enforcement officer for more than three decades, I understand the importance of our role to serve and protect the people of Alabama,” Nash said in a news release. “We will be detailed, diligent and strive to ensure a stronger, safer state through my work with fellow board members and our partnership with the Bureau and its officers in the field.”
Ivey announced that she appointed Nash to replace the former parole board chair Leigh Gwathney roughly one week ago, though Gwathney had the support of Alabama Attorney General Steve Marshall.
In a letter made available to the public, Marshall said that Gwathney had the backing of 76 law enforcement leaders.
But  she was also criticized by criminal justice reform organizations as the parole rates dropped dramatically during her time as chair, falling from more than 50% in 2017 to about 8% in 2023. It increased to 26% in the first half of 2025.
Lawmakers raised concerns during an October meeting of the Joint Prison Oversight Committee when she provided long-winded answers to their pointed questions. The parole board had not responded to written questions from legislators about parole guidelines and decisions.
At the time, the parole board was three years delayed in updating the guidelines, required by a law that legislators passed in 2018 to reform the system after Jimmy O’Neal Spencer was mistakenly granted parole and went on to kill three people.
He was subsequently charged with capital murder and sentenced to death by a jury.
The parole board published updated guidelines several weeks ago after the Legislature passed a General Fund budget in the spring that made funding the parole board contingent upon the members updating the guidelines.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_7336-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 08:08:01.876881

Generations of survivors of the federal government’s nuclear testing program and the state’s uranium mining industry have fought for years for recognition from the United States as they watched their friends and families die from cancers.
The 1990 federal Radiation and Exposure Compensation Act — created to provide restitution to people sickened by exposure to radiation and uranium — excluded New Mexico’s downwinders and post-1971 uranium miners, and expired last year after years of lobbying for expansion by victims and New Mexico’s elected leaders. New Mexico Democratic U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Luján, for instance, began introducing RECA legislation when he was first elected to the U.S. House in 2008, and did so so every year since.
Just a month ago, Luján, other members of the state’s congressional delegation and long-time advocates held a news conference to call for RECA’s renewal once again. Over the years, the coalition calling for RECA’s expansion and extension grew across states and became a bipartisan effort. In the end, Republican U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri got it over the finish line as a provision in President Donald Trump’s massive tax and spending bill.
Advocates and New Mexico officials say while RECA’s passage is worthy of celebration, more remains to be done.
“It was quite a relief, because we’ve waited so long,” said Tina Cordova, founder of the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium, during a news conference last week. The documentary film First We Bombed New Mexico highlights Cordova’s 20-year fight for justice for New Mexico’s downwinders. “Honestly, the acknowledgement is long past due,” she said. “But I also want to recognize…that we’re not there yet. We still have a lot of work to do.”
RECA’s two-year expansion “will not be long enough for us to get everybody enrolled that should be enrolled,” Cordova said. The bill also provides $100,000 lump sum payouts but no longer includes health care coverage. “We will take the win, and we will continue our fight,” Cordova said. “And we will also never forget that there are some very important people that have been left out: the people of Guam, the people of Colorado, the people of Montana, the remainder of Arizona and Nevada.” While grateful New Mexico was included, she said, “we will continue to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our sisters and brothers from those places who we’ve come to love.”
Luján and Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) last week also sent letters to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi and Secretary of Labor Lori Chavez-DeRemer urging both to issue guidance quickly for RECA given the short timeline for compensation.
Later on Wednesday, a sign dedication will take place at the entrance to the Trinity site, placing a marker there “acknowledging the sacrifice and suffering of the people of New Mexico as a result of the Trinity bomb,” Cordova said. A mass in the evening in Tularosa will include the annual candlelight vigil and reading of the names of the people who are no longer here. Source will have coverage from both events.
In advance of the 80th anniversary, Luján issued a statement about the anniversary, characterizing it as “eight decades of pain, loss, and injustice for the victims still living with the fallout of nuclear testing and uranium mining…As we reflect on the lasting harm caused by these tests and the government’s negligence, we must renew our commitment to the people still suffering today. That means doing everything we can to help them access the compensation they deserve. Together, we will keep fighting to make sure no one is left behind.”

Tina Cordova has relived the death of her father, Anastacio, many times over. In speeches before a handful of people, in phone conversations with reporters and when Luján commemorated her father on the Senate floor of Congress on March 7, 2024.

Anastacio’s story starts in Tularosa in 1945. He was just 4-years-old when the federal government detonated the first atomic bomb in the Jornada Del Muerto desert 45 miles away. Like many people living there, he drank water from open cisterns, ate local crops and hunted wildlife for food — all likely contaminated with ash from radioactive fallout.
Cordova’s voice only shakes a little as she recounts his death from 12 years ago: He whittled away to 125 pounds, the pain he was in, the months on a feeding tube. He was diagnosed with two rare oral cancers and prostate cancer — all compensable under RECA, except the program excluded the New Mexicans living downwind from the first-ever bomb.
Cordova, 64, said her dad’s death also gave her clarity. She’s a cancer survivor herself and founded the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium in 2005 to advocate for southern New Mexicans impacted for generations by the legacy of Trinity.
“I chose to do this work. I know it’s my life’s work. I know I’m suited to do this work, and I’m grateful that I’ve had this opportunity,” she told Source NM.
  Tina Cordova attends an interfaith service remembering the Trinity Test on Sunday, July 13, 2025. ‘The government never warned us afterwards, never said we should be concerned,’ she told attendees. ‘But today, we have acknowledgement, and we have the beginnings of going back to the government for more, and we will do that.’ (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)
With the recent extension of RECA, her father will finally be recognized as a downwinder and her mother may finally receive compensation on his behalf.
“My dad should still be here;$100,000 pales in comparison to who he was, and who he used to be to us,” she said. “I don’t want to sound ungrateful, I don’t want to minimize what it means, but that’s not justice. That’s the beginning of justice — it’s a step forward in the right direction.”
Cordova said she’ll take the fight back to Congress to expand benefits to states and territories that were left out and require the government to pay to cover health care costs for people exposed.
She said that in the last year, her niece was diagnosed with thyroid cancer and her youngest brother with kidney cancer.
“This just doesn’t end for us,” Cordova said. “These are the people that we can never stop fighting for. These are the people that we can never allow to be forgotten, to just basically be treated as the human collateral damage.”

Larry and Arlene Juanico

Just under the mesa, past the horno outside of Arlene Juanico’s childhood home, lie the remains of the Jackpile uranium mine, once the largest in the world. Nearly 60 miles outside of Albuquerque, the holes appear on Laguna Pueblo lands between the red and white striated mesas, nearly abutting the little village of Paguate.

With the rush for nuclear arms during the Cold War and the domestic expansion of nuclear power, the federal government was seeking to purchase uranium. A thick belt of ore snaked from Navajo Nation lands through Grants and into Laguna Pueblo. The mine operated from 1951 to 1984, marring the landscape. Tracks from the trucks wind through the valley. Entire mesas now have a terraced effect from the strip-mining. After the rain, there comes the smell: a sharp, metallic smell of uranium.
Life in the village before the closure was punctuated by blasts from the mine site, scattering light yellow dust across the landscape.
“When they blasted, everything shook, our homes rattled,” she said. “Often the ladies would run out to get the laundry, get whatever meat or fruit would be drying in the yards.”
Like her father and brother  — who later died from cancers — Arlene Juanico worked at the mine. She drove the water truck on the narrow roads, making good money at what she thought was a good job for a single mother. Her husband Larry Juanico also worked at the mine, then transferred to the Bluewater Mill, where the ore was processed into yellowcake uranium, with minimal safety precautions. People packed uranium into 55-gallon drums with their bare hands. He’d have to clean bins by climbing into them and scrubbing them with a brush, no masks, no suits.
Since they worked after 1972, the Juanicos and other uranium miners and millers did not qualify for RECA, even as many died or were sickened by exposure from radiation. But even now, the recognition or compensation from RECA is paltry to the devastation left by the mine, he said.
“Our people, our animals, our culture, our way of life are all affected by what’s happened here. The money part of it is good, but it’ll only last for a certain amount of time,” Larry Juanico said. “After all that’s gone — we’ll still be dealing with this.”
After the mine’s closure, the waste it left behind leaked uranium and other metals into the surface water and released radon, a cancer-causing gas, into the air and people’s homes. Clean up by the federal government remains unfinished.

The Juanicos said federal efforts to restart uranium mining in the area are insulting to the people sickened by exposure.
“They haven’t been taking care of us, but they want to start new mines,” Arlene Juanico said. “That will force the next generation to still fight for what the federal government still hasn’t lived up to.”
Paul Pino
Paul Pino, a retired schoolteacher, was in a daze for several days after Congress passed RECA on July 3, saying the July 4th weekend passed in a haze.
“I’m feeling two very different things,” he said. “On one hand, totally ecstatic, like over the moon, the best feeling of victory and happiness I’ve ever had in my life. On the other, I feel terrible for the people who’ve been left out from the bill; they needed the compensation also.”

Pino was born nine years after Trinity, but his mother, big brother and two older sisters were living on his family’s Carrizozo ranch, only 54 miles from the test site. His mother survived bouts of skin cancer, but died from bone cancer – selling her pickup to pay for her funeral costs just before her death. His older brother Greg died from stomach cancer, while one sister had breast cancer and the other suffered from several brain tumors.
“It was 100% devastation to my family,” he said.
Pino joined the steering committee at the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium to fight for compensation for New Mexicans impacted by Trinity.
“All my life, plus more, people in New Mexico still have been waiting for some peace,” he said. “They got it on the 80th anniversary. It’s better late than never, you know?”
Pino performs a song titled “It Ain’t Over ‘til We Win,” about the downwinders’ struggle. He recently changed the lyrics of the last line: “Yeah we won, and it’s still not over.”
“But that’s all right,” he said. “You know it’ll be a good fight.”
Phil Harrison
Uranium mining was supposed to be a good job, not a death sentence. But for hundreds of people on the Navajo Nation, it was just that, said former uranium miner Phil Harrison.
“There was no warning of the dangers,” Harrison told Source NM. “They took advantage of us.”
  Phil Harrison, a former uranium miner on the Navajo Nation, has dedicated his life to expanding compensation for people injured or killed from radiation exposure. (Danielle Prokop/Source NM)
Harrison, 74, is an advocate with the Uranium Radiation Victims Committee, a grassroots group formed in the 1970s as rising deaths and injuries rose among Navajo Nation uranium workers. He grew up in Cove, Arizona where 32 Ker-McGee Corporation mines operated from the 1940s to the 1980s. He was an underground uranium worker and remediated sites near Tuba City.
He lost his father at age 44 to lung cancer, after 20 years working in the mines. His father was part of a spate of men on the Navajo Nation dying from lung diseases and various cancers, 400 former uranium workers died in Cove and Red Valley alone.
“It wasn’t just the miners. Spouses and children who were also getting contaminated and exposed to radiation,” he said.
The grassroots group was one of the first to file lawsuits seeking compensation from the federal government, which led to Congress establishing RECA in 1990 and expanding the program in the 2000s.
The two-year window for the RECA expansion offers little time to collect the necessary documentation and visit doctors, sometimes out of state. For former uranium workers who are now eligible, that could mean difficulties since many rely on oxygen, are hospitalized or rely on assisted living and family caretakers.
“We have to get started right away,” he said. “Time is of the essence.”
Bernice Gutierrez
Bernice Gutierrez, 80, nearly shares a birthday with the Trinity Anniversary, born in Carrizozo only eight days before the blast. Her family moved to Albuquerque just a few years after the test, but health concerns followed. Gutierrez documented 41 members of her family experiencing some form of sickness, including 23 members with cancers. Seven have died as a result, including her son from pre-leukemia in 2020.

She’s documented health issues among downwinders and their descendants post-Trinity test for more than a decade, volunteering with the Tularosa Basin Downwinders Consortium.
Gutierrez called the passage “bittersweet,” as the short extension of RECA came inside a bill that cuts food assistance and medical care programs for low-income residents, which New Mexico relies heavily on.
“If the Medicaid cuts come to pass, it’s going to put people here in a world of hurt,” she said.

Gutierrez said there’s only two short years to extend the program, while trying to enroll folks who never qualified before, meaning a lot of work for the volunteers ahead.
“It was not the victory that we had hoped for, but one that we’re happy to get. It’s a starting point for us, but a point that we will continue working on to change,” Gutierrez said.

Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) hosting a tele-town hall focused on the impacts of  Republicans' Big Beautiful Bill on Michigan Residents. July 15 2025 | ScreenshotWith President Donald Trump’s signature placed on the “big, beautiful bill” Congressional Republicans have scored a victory on tax policy, making cuts to several government programs in order to extend Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and boost funding for immigration enforcement. 
As the new tax and spending policy brings changes to several government programs from Medicaid to student loans and food assistance benefits, U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin (D-Holly) hosted a tele-town hall Tuesday night to break down the impacts Michiganders can expect to see from the law. 
“This bill will affect pretty much every single person listening in one way or another,” Slotkin noted, before breaking down the law’s changes to health care. 
For individuals on an Affordable Care Act Plan or a Health Insurance Marketplace plan, Slotkin raised concerns that those individuals would see higher premiums headed into 2026.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
“There’s about 500,000 Michiganders who get coverage through Obamacare or the [Affordable Care Act] or the marketplace, but the place this is really going to hit are people who are not – they’re living above the poverty line, but they’re not super wealthy,” Slotkin said. 
Looking to Medicaid, Slotkin laid out the new work requirements placed on the program, noting that 600,000 Michiganders currently receive some form of assistance from the program, aimed at providing health insurance to adults and children with limited income. 
Beginning in 2027, individuals receiving Medicaid will be required to prove that they are working 20 hours a week or 80 hours a month in order to remain eligible. Individuals who are not working must be in job training or another eligible program. 
Additionally, beginning Jan. 1, 2027, individuals on Medicaid will have to recertify their eligibility every six months, as opposed to every year, Slotkin said. 
The work requirements will apply to everyone ages 18 to 64, whereas individuals 54 to 64 years olds did not previously need to show proof of work to maintain eligibility, Slotkin said, noting that parents of children 14 and older would also need to work 20 hours a week to maintain their eligibility. 
A report earlier this year from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services determined that imposing work requirements for Medicaid recipients to keep their coverage would cost Michigan taxpayers an additional $75 million to $155 million per year to institute a reporting program to ensure recipients meet these conditions. Additionally, data indicates that most Medicaid adults are already working or face barriers to work. 
Copays for Michigan Medicaid recipients are also expected to increase, Slotkin said. Whereas copays are currently $1 to $3, those amounts are expected to increase to $35 in 2028.

“Even if you don’t get coverage through Medicaid or through the Obamacare marketplace, what we’re concerned about is prices going up for everyone else who’s on private insurance,” Slotkin said pointing to a report from The Detroit News detailing requests for double-digit rate hikes from Michigan-based providers as tax credits put in place under former President Joe Biden expire at the end of the year. 
If your private insurance rates are set to increase, you will be notified this fall, Slotkin noted. 
Alongside the personal impacts of the Big Beautiful Bill on health care, Slotkin also pointed to the impacts the policy will have on Michigan Hospitals who rely on Medicaid, with the Michigan Health and Hospital Association expecting to see a $6 billion loss in Medicaid funding for Michigan hospitals over the next 10 years.
“We are concerned about what that kind of a loss means for our hospitals, particularly rural hospitals, hospitals that aren’t doing as well, that have a tough time making costs,” Slotkin said. 
Additionally there are more than 400 community health centers across the state that rely primarily on Medicaid funding, which Slotkin warned could either shut their doors or scale back services. The tax and spending law also defunds Planned Parenthood, she noted, by banning the use of Medicaid dollars to support the nonprofit. 
While it’s already illegal to use Medicaid dollars for abortion, this shift could see women losing access to obstetrics and gynecology appointments and family planning services, Slotkin said. 
Moving on from health care, the Senator noted that the same work requirements for Medicaid would also apply for food assistance under the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, beginning Oct. 1, 2025. 
Additionally, there could be cuts to the program down the line, with states paying a larger portion of SNAP’s administrative costs beginning in 2027, Slotkin said. 
Looking to education, Slotkin broke down changes to federal student loans beginning on July 1, 2026, with the government cutting and capping options for federal loans. 
In particular, the law places caps on the Parent PLUS loan program, where parents can take out loans based on the yearly cost of their child’s tuition minus any financial assistance their child receives. Under the new law, that amount is capped to $20,000 a year and $65,000 over a lifetime. 
With in-state tuition at Michigan State University coming in at roughly $35,000 a year, these caps immediately create a $15,000 gap that must be filled with either financial aid, or a private loan with a higher interest rate, Slotkin noted.

Loans for graduate students will be capped to $20,500 a year, limited to $100,000 over their lifetime, while students in law or medical schools can borrow up to $50,000 a year and $200,000 over their lifetime. 
For anyone looking to take advantage of the $7,500 tax credit for buying an electric vehicle, Slotkin advised them to move quickly, noting that the credit would expire on Sept. 30, 2025. 
The federal government will also cease reimbursements and tax credits on residential clean energy upgrades on Jan. 1, 2026, Slotkin said.
Additionally, Slotkin said the tax cuts contained within the legislation largely benefit wealthier tax brackets, but that most Americans would not feel much of a difference due to the continuation of the tax cuts put in place in 2018.
Slotkin also highlighted the law’s provisions against taxes on tips and overtime pay as a positive, though she emphasized these breaks were temporary as they only will apply through the 2028 tax year. 
For the no tax on tips provision, people can deduct up to $25,000 in qualified tips from their federal income taxes, though they must pay taxes on any tips above that amount. Additionally, only individuals in certain positions such as servers, bartenders and hair stylists can qualify for these tax breaks, Slotkin said. 
For the overtime tax break, individual filers can deduct up to $12,500 in overtime pay and $25,000 if they file jointly. 
While taking questions from constituents, Slotkin offered assurances on Medicare.
“This bill does not touch Medicare. So you should feel heartened by that,” Slotkin said, before noting that individuals who rely on Medicare rely on the same hospitals and community health centers that everyone else does. 
“Medicare, in the black and white is not touched by this bill, but access to care could certainly, certainly be changed, given the tough losses that our hospitals are going to be taking over the next few years,” Slotkin said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-15-at-6.34.46 PM-1024x575.png,,,2025-07-16 08:08:01.876881

(Edwin J. Torres/Governor’s Office)The former state attorney general, who was the architect of a state order that bars local law enforcement from aiding with civil immigration enforcement, is now among the attorneys defending two New Jersey cities’ sanctuary policies in federal court.
Gurbir Grewal, who was attorney general under Gov. Phil Murphy for nearly four years, is representing Newark and Hoboken against the Trump administration, which claims the local sanctuary policies interfere with federal deportation goals. Two other cities, Newark and Jersey City, are named in the suit, filed in May.
Murphy, speaking to reporters after an event in Newark on Tuesday, noted that the state order, called the Immigrant Trust Directive, has withstood judicial challenges.
“That has stood up and done well by New Jersey over the past, now seven-plus years,” Murphy said. “It’s one of the reasons we’re the safest states in America.” 
The four cities named in the Trump administration’s complaint were due on Monday to formally respond to the lawsuit. They each asked for more time.
Grewal did not respond to a request for comment.
He issued the statewide directive in November 2018, and it was revised in 2019. It bars New Jersey police officers from asking someone about their immigration status if it’s irrelevant to the police’s investigation, questioning or detaining someone based solely on actual or suspected immigration status, and providing federal immigration authorities with access to state or local resources, including equipment and databases. 
Back then, Grewal said the rules aim to draw a “clear distinction” between local police and immigration authorities, allowing victims and witnesses of crimes to feel safe reporting to state law enforcement. 
“No law-abiding resident of this great state should live in fear that a routine traffic stop by local police will result in his or her deportation from this country,” Grewal said then. 
Grewal stepped down as attorney general in 2021 to join the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, and left that job late last year. He’s now a partner at Milbank in New York.
Hoboken spokeswoman Marilyn Baer said the city continues to “stand up for immigrant communities” and noted that the 2018 mayoral order declaring Hoboken a fair and welcoming city to immigrants was based in part on the same principles outlined in the Immigrant Trust Directive.
Baer, like Murphy, noted that Grewal successfully defended the directive from challenges when he was attorney general. Former U.S. Acting Solicitor General Neal Katyal, also a partner at Milbank, will join Grewal in defending Newark and Hoboken from the Trump administration’s lawsuit.
“The City and Mayor Bhalla have full confidence in the experience and unmatched qualifications of Milbank LLP, Grewal, and Katyal to represent Hoboken’s interests in this case and to uphold the City’s longstanding commitment to protecting the rights of all residents, including immigrant communities,” Baer said.
The Trump administration’s push to detain and deport millions of immigrants has ensnared some local officials.
Rep. LaMonica McIver is facing assault charges, with federal prosecutors accusing her of shoving an immigration officer outside a detention center in Newark as Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing on the property. Baraka’s case was dismissed days later. 
And last week, the New York Times reported Murphy was subpoenaed by acting U.S. Attorney Alina Habba over comments he made in February suggesting he would hide a migrant seeking full legal status at his home and daring immigration officials to detain her. Murphy declined to comment on the report Tuesday.
Habba has previously said she is investigating Murphy and Attorney General Matt Platkin over the Immigrant Trust Directive.

We don’t oppose independent schools — we oppose public funding without public accountability.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Neil Odell: Setting the record straight.","This commentary is by Neil Odell of Norwich. He is a board member of Friends of Vermont Public Education.


Since our founding, Friends of Vermont Public Education has had one clear mission: to ensure that any school receiving public taxpayer funds adheres to the same rules, regulations and standards established by Vermont law. This belief is rooted in the Vermont Constitution, which outlines two vital provisions:

Article 7, the common benefits clause, declares that government exists for the common good — not for the advantage of any single person or group.


Section 68 affirms that “a competent number of schools ought to be maintained in each town unless the general assembly permits other provisions for the convenient instruction of youth.”

These principles informed the Vermont Supreme Court’s 1997 Brigham decision, which recognized education as a fundamental public responsibility.
We believe independent schools — historic academies, ski schools, therapeutic institutions, religious schools — can and should exist in Vermont. Their specialized missions add diversity to our educational landscape. If a student excels at skiing, for example, attending a ski school for both academics and athletic training can be beneficial. But the issue arises when taxpayer dollars are used to support these independent schools without holding them to the same standards as public schools.
Over decades, Vermont’s legislature has permitted “other provisions” for educating youth, effectively creating two separate systems: one public and one independent. These operate under different sets of rules.
This dual system came under scrutiny following the U.S. Supreme Court’s Carson v. Makin decision, which ruled that states cannot exclude religious schools from publicly funded tuition programs if they choose to fund private education.
Historically, Vermont denied funding to religious schools based on our constitution’s Article 3: “no person ought to, or of right can be compelled to attend any religious worship, or erect or support any place of worship.” After Carson, Vermont’s secretary of education instructed districts to pay tuition to religious schools.
This shift reignited concern about Vermont’s dual education system. Before 1989, independent schools were considered public schools with private governance. That changed when independent schools successfully lobbied for a distinct classification — launching a split in publicly funded education.
Since then, laws and policies tailored to independent schools have often been more relaxed than those governing public schools. The Vermont state auditor’s 2020 report made this disparity plain: “Approved Independent [Private] Schools Are Not Subject to Most of the Statutes and Rules That Govern Public Schools.”
This imbalance is what Friends of Vermont Public Education aims to fix. We believe that all schools receiving public dollars must:

Offer open enrollment without selective admissions
Protect students from dismissal without cause
Enforce consistent discipline policies
Employ licensed teachers in all classrooms
Measure and publicly report student outcomes
Meet Vermont’s Education Quality Standards
Be overseen by a properly staffed apolitical body
Abide by accountability standards regardless of school size

Despite this stance, some independent school advocates claim we aim to shut down private schools and force the state to build new public schools. That’s a distortion. We don’t oppose independent schools — we oppose public funding without public accountability.

Another claim is that applying public school standards to independent schools would drive them out of business. They fail to articulate exactly which standards would lead to their demise but if a school’s business model depends on accepting tax dollars without accountability, it’s simply not a sustainable — or fair — model.
The Vermont Legislature holds both the authority and obligation to resolve this disparity. Unfortunately, recent legislative sessions reveal a troubling trend. While some lawmakers push reform within the public school system, they simultaneously defend the status quo for independent schools — even when taxpayer dollars are involved.
This discrepancy undermines equity. Public funding should demand public standards. We call on Vermonters to challenge the existing imbalance and demand fairness.
Friends of Vermont Public Education welcomes engagement with independent schools, legislators and the governor.
Let’s discard the mischaracterizations and face the real issue: a dual system of accountability in taxpayer-funded education serves neither our students nor our citizens as well as should be. A uniform approach would improve opportunities for all students, and be more understandable to all.

(Photo by Lidija Kamansky/Getty Images)Members of the public can now view video feeds from artificial-intelligence-assisted cameras placed in 21 high-risk wildfire locations around Washington. 
The cameras have been in place since 2023 as part of a $2.5 million five-year agreement between the California-based company Pano AI and the Department of Natural Resources. But until this week, the live video was not publicly available.
The department said Monday that five additional cameras would be installed and brought online this year.
“We’re proud to support the Washington DNR’s vision for wildfire safety, and we are proud to offer this new public sharing functionality to our customers,” said Sonia Kastner, co-founder and CEO of Pano AI.
Washington still has 93 fire lookouts. While some are seasonally staffed by the U.S. Forest Service, the National Park Service, or volunteer groups, the Department of Natural Resources no longer depends on people in the lookout towers for fire detection. 
Legislation passed in 2021 gave the Department of Natural Resources funding to enact its 10-year wildland fire protection strategic plan, which included new investments to aid in early fire detection. 
The Pano AI cameras use a 360-degree field of vision and relay high-definition footage of potential fire starts to a team of around-the-clock Pano AI staff.
Based on the footage, the Pano AI team can alert the Department of Natural Resources about emerging incidents. 
The pilot project has so far been successful in identifying fires on both sides of the state and allowing firefighters to respond quickly, the Department of Natural Resources said. 
“Early detection is a key part of DNR’s wildfire rapid response model, and now Washingtonians can peek behind the scenes at how part of that detection process works,” said state forester George Geissler, who oversees wildfire management at the department. 
The camera feeds can be viewed through the Department of Natural Resources’ “Wildfire Watch” website. 
The department warned Monday that it anticipates state budget cuts could limit spending on fire detection technology going forward. 
Public Lands Commissioner Dave Upthegrove said innovations like Pano AI’s cameras are a key part of the state’s strategy for dealing with worsening fire conditions. He promised to continue working with the state Legislature to secure additional funding.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cedar-creek-fire-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 07:08:29.222429

The new institution is the state's first dental school. (Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)After years of preparation, the state’s first dental school welcomed its inaugural group of students to its Little Rock campus this month. 
Classes started at the Lyon College School of Dental Medicine last week, and officials are already gearing up to interview candidates for the second cohort in August. Founding Dean Dr. Burke Soffe said he’s shed several tears over this “exciting moment” and he’s “extremely proud” of the 80 students who’ve just started their three-year journey.
“We were really intentional in the admissions process to screen for leaders and to screen for those that are committed to dentistry, committed to rural areas, committed to serving and just high-character individuals,” Soffe said. “We’ve got really special students who are ready to make an impact.”
Providing dental education in Arkansas could help address the state’s need for more providers. Arkansas had the lowest dentist-to-patient ratio in 2023 with about 41 dentists per 100,000 people, according to the American Dental Association. Previously, Arkansas was one of 14 states without a dental school, which contributed to a lower ratio because students would study in other states and remain there after graduation. 
Lyon’s class of 2028 hails from 17 states, with 43% from Arkansas and 33% from border states. Alex Crawley, a member of the private school’s inaugural class, described herself as “a huge homebody” and said Lyon was appealing because it’s close to Jonesboro where she grew up. 
“Knowing that I want to stay around family forever, I’m thinking I’m going to stay in Arkansas, and so might as well go to school in Arkansas, build connections,” she said.

Crawley and her classmates are temporarily attending lectures in the top floor of a building that previously housed Arkansas Blue Cross and Blue Shield in Little Rock’s Riverdale neighborhood. Lyon is leasing the first through sixth floors, which are still being renovated, and the 12th floor.
The construction company is moving as quickly as possible considering “all of the volatility with tariffs” and supplies, Soffe said. Once the project is complete, the campus will include a student center, classrooms, simulation clinic and patient care clinics, where Soffe said they can provide general and pediatric dentistry, and care for patients with special needs. 
When other floors open, the 12th floor will become an event space for continuing education events, Soffe said. Because there is limited time for networking, Soffe said Lyon wants to bring the dental community to students, in part through a mentorship program called the Scots DEN (Dentistry Engagement Network).
Mentorship helped Cade Judd find his calling in dentistry. Growing up, dentist visits were enjoyable to the Longview, Texas, student because his provider was a family friend. Shadowing her “solidified my passion” for dentistry, Judd said, particularly after seeing one patient cry “tears of joy” after a progressive procedure improved her smile.
“I pulled my dentist aside after that case was over with, and I told her, I said, ‘That’s it, that is why I want to be a dentist right there.’ So from that day on, that’s been my goal, and I haven’t really looked back since,” he said.

Mentorship helps “plant a seed” so students could potentially see themselves “living in a rural community and making a difference, while at the same time making a good living and paying back loans, which all of those are important,” Soffe said.
Many Lyon students took out loans to pay for the annual $102,000 tuition, but a new law could make accessing those loans more difficult. A massive budget bill signed into law this month includes a provision to eliminate Grad PLUS loans, which help finance higher education degrees. Without them, students will have to take out unsubsidized federal loans, which will be restricted to $50,000 per year and have a $200,000 lifetime cap for professional degrees like law or medicine, CBS News reports. 
Lyon is working to create institutional scholarships, but it’s challenging because donors want to see the program up and running first, Soffe said.
“Dental school is expensive, and we want to be a possibility for those [students], whether it be in rural Arkansas or elsewhere, to be able to pursue their education here in the state,” he said. 
Crawley has loans and admits dental school is expensive, but said “it’s a big investment for your future,” and Lyon has provided them with information about how to make smart financial decisions. 
Lyon has also emphasized that this inaugural class is a family and that it’s okay to ask for help and rely on your classmates because you can’t do it alone, Crawley said. 
Students can expect to be in class from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. with a lunch break at noon, she said. Crawley anticipates studying for a few more hours outside of class, but said she wants to prioritize making time to exercise to maintain balance. 
“It’s definitely a lot, it’s hard. It’s going to be a transition, but practice makes better,” she said. “It’s a little overwhelming, but we’ll get the hang of it and we have each other.”
The Lyon College School of Dental Medicine will host Give Kids a Smile Day from 9 a.m. to noon Friday. The event includes free oral health screenings and education for children and adults. More information is available here.

“The big GOP victory this month doesn’t have to be the last word on their legislation any more than Obamacare’s enactment was. (Minority Leader Hakeem) Jeffries’s marathon speech could be a starting point akin to (then-Speaker John) Boehner’s primal scream.”
Democratic National Committee Chair Ken Martin is apparently thinking along the same lines, while also taking a presumptive strength of the bill — tax cuts — and turning the idea on its head. The DNC, desperate to make Americans more aware of the bill’s unpopular but little known provisions, launched a new website this week called TrumpTax.com, tracking the impact of Trump’s budget and trade policies on families across the country. 
The site’s Minnesota section details the loss of jobs, health care and food assistance; doomed rural hospitals; and increased costs from Trump’s tariff and energy policies. 
Citing the the Congressional Budget Office, KFF Health News reports that the bill’s cuts to Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act — as well as Trump administration regulatory changes — will increase the number of uninsured by about 17 million by 2034. The Urban Institute estimates that 22.3 million Americans will lose access to some or all SNAP benefits. The bill also cuts renewable energy tax credits that were leading to a manufacturing upswing of $133 billion in investment — often in Republican states and counties — as of the spring of 2024, NBC News reported. With the spigot turned off, utilities will scramble to meet rising demand, leading to more expensive electricity bills.
The bill will also expand the federal deficit, which will increase interest payments on the debt, and possibly interest rates as well, hindering Americans’ ability to borrow for a home, car or business. Meanwhile, economists expect Trump’s tariffs to juice inflation, as data released Tuesday may have begun to show. 
Republican backers — the bill didn’t receive a single Democratic vote in either chamber — are cheering the cuts and deficits as necessary to win sought-after tax provisions, some of whose biggest beneficiaries will be the wealthiest families. The bill extends the 2017 Trump tax cuts; expands the child tax credit to $2,200 per child and indexes it to inflation; increases the standard deduction; increases the deduction for state and local taxes; reduces taxes on tips and overtime; reduces taxes on wealthy heirs; and gives a bevy of tax breaks to various business arrangements, among many other provisions. 
“Donald Trump promised to lower costs on day one, but six months into his disastrous second term, he’s robbing working Minnesotans to fund tax handouts for his billionaire backers,” Martin said in a statement accompanying the new tracker. As chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, Martin never lost a statewide race in 15 years. 
One problem for Democrats in the near term, however: Republicans shrewdly — politically, if not fiscally — delayed the safety net cuts until after the midterm elections, which means many Americans will see the benefits of the bill while the costs won’t be felt for some time. The bill is already among the least popular pieces of major legislation in recent history, but polling also shows many Americans are tuned out and not even aware of it.
With the bill’s passage but the narrative about it thus far unformed, Martin — who’s suffered a rough go of it as DNC chair, thus far — is finally able to return to the partisan brawling he was known for at home. 
During a recent interview with Lauren Egan, Martin was frank: “My job is to throw punches. I didn’t come here to make friends. I didn’t come here to try to preserve the option to work with Republicans down the road. My job is to win — and to call them out for their bullshit.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 08:08:01.876881

With the bill’s passage but the narrative about it thus far unformed, Martin — who’s suffered a rough go of it as DNC chair, thus far — is finally able to return to the partisan brawling he was known for at home. 
During a recent interview with Lauren Egan, Martin was frank: “My job is to throw punches. I didn’t come here to make friends. I didn’t come here to try to preserve the option to work with Republicans down the road. My job is to win — and to call them out for their bullshit.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 07:08:29.222429

While the Occupant of the White House has wreaked havoc on the lives and fortunes of immigrant families in Los Angeles, New York, and other sanctuary cities, his MAGA partner in Florida has been working just as diligently to wage war on undocumented immigrants and foreign-born, brown-skinned U.S. citizens.
The DeSantis administration made it unlawful for anyone to transport undocumented immigrants, characterizing that act as human smuggling. Senate Bill 1718 also invalidated drivers licenses issued by other states to undocumented immigrants; orders that hospitals and clinics that accept Medicaid question patients about their immigration status and report these data (without personally identifiable information) to the state; and the law now requires undocumented individuals taken into custody by a law enforcement agency to submit a DNA sample when he or she is booked into a jail, correctional, or juvenile facility.
(The U.S. Supreme Court has for now upheld an injunction against the law pending a legal challenge.)
DeSantis announced in February that the Florida Highway Patrol, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission, and the Florida State Guard had entered into agreements to help U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement round up migrants.
The latest piece of the anti-immigration dragnet occurred on Tuesday, July 1, when DeSantis officially opened a migrant detention center at  little-used airport, deep in the Everglades, slated to house as many as 5,000 migrants awaiting deportation, DeSantis and Trump administration officials told CNN.
Meanwhile, the MAGA Republican Project 2025 blueprint in Florida and nationally is forcing people to choose between paying rent and buying medicines; between purchasing groceries and paying back their student loans. All these leaders are doing, per the authoritarian playbook, is stoking fear among Floridians and Americans about a fake enemy while pursuing health, environmental, and other policies that make people weaker and easier to dominate and oppress.
When President Donald Trump visited the detention center, he gave DeSantis the pat on the head the governor so deeply craves.

 Consternation
Establishment of this concentration camp has caused consternation among critics including environmental activists, civil and human rights advocates, immigration supporters, and members of the Miccosukee and Seminole tribes. Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit before Florida officials opened the facility.
“This site is more than 96% wetlands, surrounded by the Big Cypress National Preserve, and is habitat for the endangered Florida panther and other iconic species,” Friends of the Everglades executive director Eve Samples said in a news release. “This scheme is not only cruel, it threatens the Everglades ecosystem that state and federal taxpayers have spent billions to protect.”
The lawsuit names several federal and state agencies as defendants, including the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the Florida Division of Emergency Management.
The two groups claim in the lawsuit that the division holds no independent authority to construct and manage a correctional facility and that attempting to do so exceeds the scope of authority granted by Florida law.
They also contend “the installation of housing units, construction of sanitation and food services system, industrial high-intensity lighting infrastructure, diesel power generators, substantial fill material altering the natural terrain, and provision of transportation logistics (including apparent planned use of the runway to receive and deport detainees) poses clear environmental impacts” to listed species, wetlands, and surface waters.
Melissa Abdo, regional director of the National Parks Conservation Association Sun Coast, outlined the danger to the fragile wetlands:
“Building a bare-bones tented detention center on hot tarmac in the middle of the Everglades and exposing imprisoned immigrants to the elements is a cruel and absurd proposal,” she said. “The Everglades’ intense heat, humidity, and storms can be hazardous without proper precautions. This facility’s remote, harsh nature could leave people in very real danger, especially as Florida’s heat index skyrockets and hurricane season escalates.
“Development of this scale at this location would require massive changes to an ecologically delicate landscape, including running huge generators, trucking in massive amounts of food and water and trucking out waste. Endangered wildlife, iconic national parks, and Florida’s fresh drinking water supply would be at risk from this ill-conceived plan. Communities and villages that live in the area, as well as the people detained and working at this facility, could all be at serious risk if the need arose to quickly evacuate from a hurricane, using only a single two-lane highway that’s currently under construction.”

 Grotesque acts of cruelty
DeSantis, Trump, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, and immigration arch-villain Steven Miller are positively gleeful as they orchestrate these grotesque acts of cruelty.
Just in case you’re unaware of the shamelessness we’re dealing with, consider that the Republican Party of Florida is selling “Alligator Alcatraz” merchandise, hats, T-shirts, and other gear.
The White House is unconcerned about the dehumanization of human beings, the optics, or the fact that fewer than 10% of those who have been kidnapped by ICE have committed serious crimes. They love the “cartoonish imagery of a draconian outpost in a wilderness patrolled by razor-toothed reptiles and venomous snakes.”
“The only way out is a one-way flight. It is isolated and surrounded by dangerous wildlife and unforgiving terrain,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Monday. “When you have illegal murderers and rapists and heinous criminals in a detention facility surrounded by alligators, yes, I do think that’s a deterrent for them to try to escape.”
Of course, DeSantis’ spokesman said the governor plans to oppose the lawsuit in court.
“Governor Ron DeSantis has insisted that Florida will be a force multiplier for federal immigration enforcement, and this facility is a necessary staging operation for mass deportations located at a pre-existing airport that will have no impact on the surrounding environment,” said Bryan Griffin in an email. “We look forward to litigating this case.”
Author and MSNBC contributor Brian Tyler Cohen captured the absurdity in a recent Facebook post: “Alligator Alcatraz was built in eight days. It took just over a week to create a massive concentration camp. Remember that the next time those in power claim they can’t house the homeless, feed the starving or provide medical care for the poor. They can. They just don’t want to.”
DeSantis leveraged emergency powers to seize the land the concentration camp sits on and fast-tracked the project under the pretext of attempting to stem “a crisis of illegal immigration.” An executive order allowed the state to award no-bid contracts and begin construction despite the strenuous objections from Miami-Dade County Mayor Daniella Levine Cava and local activists.
Amazingly, DeSantis has launched the project during hurricane season, planning on siphoning off $450 million in FEMA money that’s supposed to pay for assistance to residents and handle any potential damage caused by hurricanes during what experts expect to be a busy hurricane season. However, DHS has said in court papers that it neither funded nor authorized the detention center.
Trump has expressed his desire to open these camps around the country, while DeSantis official told CNN in a statement that another site at the Camp Blanding National Guard training center in northeast Florida is also in the works.
Lost in the lies and demonization is that the undocumented are often escaping poverty, political upheaval, gangs, and other challenges in their home countries. All they want is a chance to live their lives, take care of themselves and their families, and be left alone. Instead, they have become political footballs in the cynical political calculus of racist xenophobes like DeSantis, Trump, and Miller.
“When we talk about people as if they’re vermin … The location, the manner in which it’s done, the dehumanizing language … there’s nothing about this detention camp that is not cruel and inhumane,” said Thomas Kennedy of the Florida Immigration Coalition in a CNN interview.

(Screenshot from livestream)Indiana’s Natural Resources Commission unanimously approved new, permanent regulations for carbon dioxide sequestration on Tuesday evening.
Among the provisions are definitions, agreements between pore space owners and storage operators, transmission pipeline certificates of authority, permitting, insurance requirements, record-keeping and more.
The voice vote came after impassioned appeals from Hoosiers living near a prominent pilot project led by Wabash Valley Resources.
‘Fight for us’: Hoosiers ask DNR to revise carbon dioxide sequestration regulations

The company plans to pipe and inject 1.67 million tons of carbon dioxide annually a mile below the earth’s surface as part of its plan to produce anhydrous ammonia fertilizer at a former coal gasification plant in West Terre Haute.
Residents clashed with the commission over its responsibilities.
“I’m a simple farm girl … and I don’t know anything about this, but I do know that this meeting is unlawful according to Indiana Code,” said Vigo County resident Whitney Boyce.
She accused the commission of not posting the meeting agenda in the required 48 hours ahead of time, adding that the video from Friday’s fiery public hearing hasn’t been uploaded and comments that day weren’t responded to.
Commission chair Bryan Poynter assured attendees that state law was followed.
“We do take public comment very seriously,” he said. “… And I know that there’s been some questioning of posting of agendas and other things, and I went back to make sure, and I just want everybody to know that … we have posted those accordingly.”
The 12-member, autonomous board addresses issues related to the Department of Natural Resources.
DNR Assistant General Counsel Whitney Wampler, who had served as hearing officer, emphasized that public comments were taken for a month longer than required during her summary of the regulations’ journey.
Witnesses, however, described a lack of trust.

Vermillion County resident Scott Nogle said he saw “a lot of faces that weren’t there” on Friday. He asked commission members if they’d listened remotely or reviewed notes on the concerns raised.
“I don’t think you’re really looking at this as a serious matter, as you say you are,” Nogle continued. “… And I don’t think you’re educated on the subject. I don’t think you’re qualified to vote on the subject. That’s just my opinion.”
“Protect our people, protect our water, protect our land and our wildlife,” he said. “That’s what we’re asking. Do your job.”
Poynter, the commission’s leader, pushed back.
“We are doing our job,” he said. “… This body is doing what the legislature asked us to do, trying to do it the best we can.”
He described the “copious” background materials provided to commission members, adding, “We do feel like we’ve cataloged a lot of those public comments.”
Impacted Hoosiers have criticized the definitions as overly vague; denounced eminent domain provisions; pushed for stronger insurance requirements; and sought details for emergency response, among numerous public complaints.
“An emergency response plan in the event of a catastrophic rupture is something that needs to be shared with us, the public,” Vigo County resident Janet Cianteo said.
She said DNR hasn’t offered enough information to “give people trust and know that our lives matter, that we are important, that our children are important, and that you take us seriously,” adding, “It’s going to take a lot more than just making a quick vote.”

The regulations don’t include emergency response because Indiana doesn’t have control over the Class VI sequestration permits, Wampler said — the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency does.
That’s also why pipeline safety is absent. Such considerations are the realm of the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration.
“I can sense the passion,” Poynter told attendees. “I know that this is important to you, and we do thank you so much for coming and making your voice known.”
Lawmakers first authorized the Wabash Valley Resources pilot in 2019 and revisited it in 2023. In between, in 2022, they established requirements for carbon sequestration projects and exempted the pilot from them.
Also in 2023, lawmakers had DNR come up with temporary, emergency rules and tasked the agency with developing permanent regulations. They’ve been in the works since.
The commission voted for preliminary adoption in March. With final approval nabbed on Tuesday, the regulations remain on track to take effect as soon as October, according to a regulatory analysis.

(Photo by Jerod MacDonald-Evoy/Arizona Mirror)The Hoosier State is home to more than 426,500 immigrants from countries such as Mexico, India, China, Nigeria, and the Philippines. Their spending power is $12.3 billion, and they pay $4.1 billion in local, state, and federal taxes. Almost 8% of Indiana’s workforce are immigrants, employed in health care, education, agriculture, manufacturing, and so many more industries. 
Although over 98% of foreign-born individuals in Indiana are here legally, Indiana’s policymakers have focused on advancing policies that harm all immigrants. For example, during the recent General Assembly legislative session, almost 20 immigration policy bills were proposed — most of them punitive and aimed at creating harm to the safety and well-being of immigrants often without regard to their legal status.
Most recently, Attorney General Todd Rokita issued an advisory opinion to a county prosecutor stating that law enforcement officers can arrest individuals, “especially illegal aliens,” who commit the misdemeanor offense of driving without a license. This opinion singles out of immigrants who cannot get driving licenses for myriad reasons, including ever-changing federal laws and regulations. The AG uses language in the opinion that perpetuates the “immigrants are dangerous” rhetoric and is a harmful generalization of immigrants. Surely, this is not Hoosier hospitality. 
Immigrant Welcome Center is an Indianapolis-based nonprofit that has worked for the last 19 years to ensure that our immigrant neighbors have access to services and support they need to put down roots. As a trusted partner and advocate, we strive to provide fact-based information to legislators and our community in general to counter myths regarding immigrants and increase awareness about the overwhelmingly positive impact immigrant neighbors have on our economy, our communities, and our state. 
We believe that there are sensible solutions that can help our immigrant neighbors feel welcomed, safe, and thrive in the communities they live and work in. For example, House Bill 1224 and Senate Bill 296 were attempts to create such solutions by providing driving cards that would enable individuals to obtain auto insurance to allow them to drive safely to and from places such as work, school, and medical appointments. The safety of individuals can also be ensured by keeping our schools, courts, and places of worship as neutral spaces, as opposed to staging points for law enforcement and ICE. 
We are confident that these solutions are possible. Let’s sit down and learn about our immigrant neighbors, how they make our state great through their contributions, and dispel myths and disinformation. We can collectively work on policies that support our immigrant neighbors and make our state welcoming.

(Courtesy of the FDA)A Kansas City company is illegally marketing pills that have opioid-like effects and could face possible action, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration wrote in a warning letter sent Tuesday.
Shaman Botanicals LLC is a leading supplier of a substance called 7-OH being sold in pill form and as an ingredient in drinks. The name, 7-OH, is short for 7-hydroxymitragynine, and it’s made by chemically converting the main opioid-inducing element in kratom. 
The letter sent to Shaman was also sent to six other companies, all but one of which have their products manufactured at Shaman Botanical using its patented 7-OH formula, said Vince Sanders, Shaman’s owner. 
Shaman was the first company to make 7-OH products, he said.
The FDA posted the letters publicly on its website Tuesday and issued a press release.
“This action reflects the agency’s growing concern around novel potent opioid products being marketed to U.S. consumers and sold online and in smoke shops, gas stations, and corner stores,” the FDA’s press release states. “While 7-OH occurs naturally in trace amounts in kratom, the agency’s letters focus on concentrated 7-OH products such as tablets, gummies, drink mixes, and shots, which may be dangerous.” 
Shaman’s own products are called 7-OH White Vein and Green Vein chewable tablets. It white labels EDP 7OH shots made in Kansas City by Relax Relief Rejuvenate Trading, LLC, and the owners Dustin Robinson and Ajaykumar Patel also received a warning letter as well.

“7-OH is not lawful in dietary supplements and cannot be lawfully added to conventional foods,” the agency’s release states. “Consumers who use 7-OH products are exposing themselves to products that have not been proven safe or effective for any use.”
Sanders told The Independent Tuesday that the company conducted three research studies on the products, including using rodents and beagles, which he believes shows the products are safe.
“We’ve spent an enormous amount of money and time on this,” he said, regarding the scientific studies. “My 82-year-old mother takes it twice a day. She was in so much pain… and it changed her life.” 
Aside from pain relief, Sanders has advocated in Washington D.C. and in a recent column in the Kansas City Star that the product can also be a harm reduction tool for people addicted to opioids.
“There’s some addiction specialists that are just like, ‘Hey, this is too important,’” Sanders said. “The public needs this product. We can’t lose it, so we’re going to have some big voices on our side.”
However, several experts, including one from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, wrote a “letter to the editor” in December, arguing that 7-OH has the potential to create an addiction problem for individuals.
“…chronic 7-hydroxymitragynine product use could result in opioid-like physical dependence and possibly addiction,” the letter published in The Society for the Study of Addiction journal. 
Missouri lawmakers attempted to ban 7-OH products this spring, but some contended the amended version of the bill would have only regulated kratom products and not 7-OH. The bill died after the Senate failed to take it up for a committee hearing. 
 What is 7-OH?

Understanding what 7-OH is requires a bit of chemistry.
Kratom leaves come from a tropical tree found in Southeast Asia, and they can be crushed and then smoked, brewed with tea, or placed into gel capsules.
The leaves contain an alkaloid called mitragynine. During digestion, the body converts it into 7-hydroxymytragynine, or 7-OH, in small amounts. It’s what gives people the opioid-like effect.
The 7-OH products the FDA is targeting contain a highly concentrated amount of 90% to 100%. To make it, companies take mitragynine and chemically oxidize it to make a concentrate. 
Eating apple seeds is a good way to explain the difference between 7-OH products and regular kratom products, said Charles White, chair of the department of pharmacy practice at the UConn School of Pharmacy.
Apple seeds contain a small amount of natural amygdalin, he said. If you chew the seeds and swallow them, the amygdalin converts into a trace amount of the natural ingredient cyanide in the body. The amount of cyanide produced, he said, is too low to hurt anyone because people couldn’t eat enough apples. 
“What if a company extracted the amygdalin out of the seeds and put it through a chemical process to produce cyanide and only put the cyanide in a tablet in a dose that can kill people,” he said. “Then when people express concern, you tell them that it is safe and refer to data on the healthy effects of apples to sell it.” 
The way that 7-OH is being marketed as kratom is what has the FDA and some medical experts concerned. 
“The 7-OH only stimulates opioid receptors and does so 30 times stronger than mitragynine, and produces an effect similarly as strong as morphine,” White said. 
Christopher McCurdy, a professor of medicinal chemistry and associate dean of the University of Florida College of Pharmacy, has conducted studies on rodents that have shown 7-OH to be as highly addictive as prescription opioids. 
The way they’re being marketed reminds him of the overprescribing of opioid medications for pain relief that began in the 1990s, which led to a national opioid crisis. 
“The narrative is so incorrect that’s being spread about these products,” he said. “It harkens back to the days when OxyContin was first being marketed. It’s deja vu, and it’s unfortunately another potential crisis in the making.”
McCurdy said the “hallmark sign” that it’s an opioid is that the respiratory depressive effects and the abuse potential in animals can be reversed with Narcan, a life-saving medicine used to reverse an opioid overdose. 
Kirsten Smith, an assistant professor at the John Hopkins Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, recently completed a study on 7-OH, which examined use motivations and addiction potential. Papers are currently under peer-review. 
“I’m seeing a signal of 7-OH that implies that while there are many reported benefits,” she said, “there is a substance use disorder quality to this that does not seem to be the case with caffeine or kratom.” 
Smith said the effects of 7-OH may wear off quickly, meaning people may want to take it again sooner, and that’s important when understanding addiction potential.
She questions why FDA action did not occur two years ago when the products first came on the market.  
“Where has the FDA been?” she said. “I find it to be remarkable that this has been going on for two years without proper regulation.”
Michele Ross, a drug addiction neuroscientist and a scientific advisor with the 7-OH advocacy group 7-HOPE Alliance, said she doesn’t dispute that 7-OH is more potent than kratom.
“That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s bad or more addictive,” she said. “It just means you need a smaller amount of 7-hydroxymytragynine to get some relief effects.”
Ross works with chronic pain patients, she said, and she believes 7-OH can be less toxic than taking kratom products because less of it is metabolized through the liver and kidneys.
“I’ve heard estimates of 20 million doses [of 7-OH] per month have been sold for the last two years, and there’s no deaths,” she said. “So if this was this terrible, dangerous, highly-addictive substance, there’d be deaths.”
The FDA has rejected kratom as a new dietary ingredient several times, she said, despite the amount of research done to prove its safety.
“CBD has been as well,” she said. “They keep rejecting it. So the problem isn’t that these aren’t FDA approved. The problem is how the FDA approves substances.”

Mike Parson.

The audit said that the interest, although earned on the road improvement funds, should have gone into general revenue, as required by the law in place at the time. Lawmakers have subsequently allowed the interest in following years to remain in the road fund.
The audit separately found that Malek’s office failed to conduct annual audits of the MOScholars tuition assistance program as required by law, the report stated.
Malek took office in January 2023, appointed after Fitzpatrick resigned to be sworn in as auditor. The audit report says that for the period that Fitzpatrick was treasurer, all work on the audit was supervised by the office’s audit director. The audit that covered fiscal 2023 and fiscal 2024 gave Malek an overall rating of good.
In a response included in the audit, Malek said he disagreed with the finding about the improper deposits but accepted the second one about the annual audit. He said his office is working to put a contract for the audit out for bid.
With a bulging general revenue surplus approaching $8 billion at the start of 2023, then-Gov. Mike Parson proposed spending $859 million to widen and rebuild portions of I-70 near Kansas City, St. Louis and Columbia. Lawmakers bumped that to $2.8 billion, including $1.4 billion from general revenue, to widen the highway to three lanes in each direction across the state.
The remainder of the amount is to come from bonds issued by the Missouri Highways and Transportation Commission.
The general revenue was deposited in the dedicated fund soon after the start of fiscal year 2024 and collected interest until the first draw on it was made in May. As of June 30, and after earning more than $81 million of interest, almost $1.3 billion remained.
The bonds are being sold as money is needed for the project.
The treasurer’s office “provided no constitutional or statutory provision to support that (the I-70 funds) are authorized to retain the investment interest income in each fund,” the audit states. “Further, no other administratively created account has its interest income credited to the account by the (state treasurer’s office) unless there is a valid legal basis for such action, such as specific law, a court order, or a federal regulation.”
In his response, Malek defended the way the interest income was handled and said the auditor’s office “is alone in its conclusion that investment and interest income from these funds should be credited to general revenue.”
His office, the governor’s office and the General Assembly, Malek said, “are all of the clear opinion that the investment and interest income earned by these funds set aside for the reconstruction of Interstate 70 should be dedicated to road construction and improvements.”
Questions about how the interest was being credited were first raised in February 2024, when members of the House Budget Committee grilled Malek about it. A state law requires that earnings on all funds in the treasury, except those created by state law and specifically exempt, be credited to the general revenue fund.
The bulk of the interest was earned on the general revenue set aside for I-70 in a special project fund. Malek said at the time that it was not being returned to general revenue because of a memorandum of understanding between the governor’s office and the Office of Administration, which has spending authority for the portion that originally came from general revenue.
The budget for fiscal 2025, which ended June 30, and the current year, have provisions explicitly directing that interest receipts on money dedicated to the I-70 project — as well as additional money set aside for work on Interstate 44 — should be deposited in the project funds.
House Budget Committee Chairman Dirk Deaton, a Republican from Noel, said in an interview Tuesday that the interest provisions added to the budget were based on his and other legislators’ perception that the money had been misdirected during fiscal 2024.
Parson’s administration asked for the language last year and it has been continued, Deaton said.
“For me, it was an admission that, in fact, it was not handled properly in the first place,” he said.
In the audit report, Fitzpatrick agrees with that assessment.
The treasurer’s office “argues the inclusion of language pertaining to investment interest…in the fiscal year 2025 appropriations bills ‘ratified’” the way interest was handled in fiscal 2024. That is not so, the audit states.
“Furthermore, the inclusion of this new language pertaining to these funds in the fiscal year 2025 appropriation bills implies an awareness that such language was necessary to resolve the investment interest issue going forward.”
 MOScholars program

The audit’s findings on the MOScholars program show that it issued $8.4 million in tax credits in fiscal 2023 to match donations to organizations authorized to offer tuition vouchers. The tax credits are equal to 100% of a donation but can only be used to offset 50% of a taxpayer’s liability in a single year. 
The program, which received a $50 million infusion of general revenue for direct grants for the first time this year, was established in 2021. A lawsuit filed earlier this month is challenging the legality of the direct grants.
The law establishing the program requires annual audits that have not been performed, the audit found. The audit also found lax oversight of reports from the agencies that provide the tuition vouchers. 
Both of the problems are being corrected, Malek said in the response. The office will review reports from the agencies more carefully and a contract will be offered through the state purchasing system for the required audits.

(Photo by Blair Miller, Daily Montanan)Now that America is in the 249th year of our republic, getting ready for the Semiquincentennial celebration next July 4, it is time to consider what kind of a government is forming before our eyes.
Is it a government truly “of the people, by the people, for the people” – or is it now dictum by blunt-force trauma?
What roles will our four Republican representatives in Congress – Sens. Steve Daines and Tim Sheehy, Reps. Troy Downing and Ryan Zinke – carry out on behalf of Montanans in the next three-and-a-half years? To this point,  all four have adhered to the wishes of President Trump – except for the sale of public lands in the West. 
How will these four collaborate in the Senate and House to restore the separation of powers envisioned in the Constitution? Do they care about it? Frankly, at this point we don’t know.
Do they want to return the federal “power of the purse strings” to the House in deciding how much money is spent on different government activities and initiating all spending bills? Will the Senate exercise its shared fiscal responsibilities with the House?
And on tariffs: While Congress has delegated certain authorities to the president, the Constitution explicitly grants Congress in Article I, Section 8, the power to “lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises,” placing tariffs squarely within congressional purview. What does our delegation think about the international – and domestic – upheaval caused by Trump’s chaotic approach?
What do our well-educated and gentlemanly representatives think about the level of name-calling from the Oval Office – by historic standards beneath the dignity of the position? And are they supportive of the unfettered actions of retribution against Trump’s perceived enemies?
As Montanans we don’t know because each member of our delegation purposefully chooses not to directly engage us except for carefully arranged and vetted interactions. But these same guys are big players on Fox talk shows and on the “X” platform if you happen to have an account. 
It is well known that many Montanans are concerned about the plight of Palestinians caught in devastation reminiscent of World War II, yet our delegation stands with Netanyahu’s government. Are they content have Bebe pound Gaza into oblivion while their only public comment is that they “stand with” him? Again, we don’t know.
Trump said the ongoing immigration roundup would focus on the “worst of the worst,” but ICE data shows 72% of those detained so far have no criminal history. Across the country, we are seeing collateral damage to agriculture, industry, construction, nursing care and the hospitality industry. Might any of our four consider a guest-worker program that would rachet down the national drama and provide workable solutions? Or do they continue to fear the word “amnesty” as a full stop to any discussion?
These are answers we would like to have. 
During the upcoming months, we’ll learn the full extent of federal funding hits to Montana on the state budget, education, food and childcare resources, Medicaid as it exists here and the domino effect changes in that program to fall on our rural hospitals. What do our semi-sequestered representatives truly understand about these concerns, or, as it seems, are they just parroting the party line? 
May we ask them questions with opportunity for follow-ups?

The lawsuits filed Monday and Tuesday allege the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commission acted arbitrarily and capriciously in awarding a $232.7 million contract for the construction of a backup generation plant, arguing it ignored health risks and alternatives to reach a predetermined outcome.
“Even though the Ironbound already has more gas plants than any other neighborhood in New Jersey, PVSC is insisting on adding yet another gas plant to our neighborhood, notwithstanding the several years of community opposition,” Ironbound Community Corporation CEO Hazel Applewhite said in a declaration attached to its suit.
For years, local officials, residents, and environmentalists have opposed the commission’s effort to install a gas-powered backup generation plant in an industrial section of Newark near the Ironbound neighborhood, charging it would further overburden a community that, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, already hosts more than 100 brownfield sites.
A spokesperson for the commission declined to comment.
The suits question the project’s specifications, which call for a facility that could generate 34 megawatts of electricity during an outage lasting up to two weeks, charging it is out of step with past disruptions.
The commission’s sewage treatment plant was flooded during Hurricane Sandy, causing a loss of power that stretched to roughly 50 hours and pushed about 840 million gallons of water containing untreated sewage into the Passaic River and Newark Bay. The plant has since seen resilience improvements.
Under plans the commission approved last month, the site would host two 24-megawatt gas turbines, 5 megawatts of battery storage, and 5 megawatts of solar generation that would not function during a storm.
The renewables capacity was added at the behest of the Department of Environmental Protection, which in a July 2024 decision found fully renewable alternatives to the gas plant were not feasible, and approved a modified permit for the facility in April. The Ironbound Community Corporation has appealed the approval of that permit.
“Clean energy should be the solution that they’re looking at — battery storage, solar should be the solution they should be looking at, and not forcing more pollution into our community,” Applewhite told the Monitor.
The commission in 2022 solicited and considered renewable alternatives, but rejected wind, solar, and storage options because they could not provide enough capacity within the project’s footprint and could not be relied on during severe weather.
In earlier years, plant opponents cautioned that the backup plant would be used to regularly generate power for the grid instead of only being turned on for testing and during severe storms.
The commission in June approved a resolution that said it would not seek to export power it generates to the grid, but that concern may be more pressing as electricity rates embark on a steep climb fueled by surging demand and largely stagnant supply.

Article Summary



Industrial hemp production was legalized in the U.S. and in Illinois in 2018. The industry was largely expected to produce items like industrial textiles and non-intoxicating CBD products.
Since then, a legal “gray area” has allowed for hemp to be used in the production of unregulated, intoxicating and synthetic THC products.
Stakeholders including the governor say this undercuts the state’s legal cannabis market and puts consumers at risk.
For the past three years, legislation to more strictly regulate the industry has failed in the General Assembly.
The legislative fight largely pits the state’s legalized cannabis industry against its industrial hemp growers.



This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


RUSHVILLE, Ill. — Justin and Anna Ward of Stoney Branch Farms were anxiously awaiting action on legislation to regulate intoxicating hemp products this spring in Illinois, which would have determined the future of their family-run hemp business in Rushville. But it never came.

Hemp farming has been legal and regulated in Illinois since 2018, when lawmakers passed the Industrial Hemp Act following federal action that legalized hemp production. The legislation anticipated it would again be used to make industrial products, but also for the production of CBD oils that can be extracted from the plant and are marketed as having therapeutic, but not intoxicating, properties.

But hemp has since become the subject of heated debate in Illinois and other states as the plant has been increasingly used to create synthetic products with intoxicating compounds that are not regulated by the federal government. Those products, known as delta-8 THC, are permissible due to what some describe as a “loophole” in the 2018 Farm Bill that legalized hemp production.

Gov. JB Pritzker has been a vocal opponent of intoxicating hemp, saying it undercuts the state’s legal cannabis industry and puts children and teens in harm's way. He’s advocated – thus far to no avail – for regulating intoxicating hemp products similarly to the state’s legalized cannabis industry.

“This regulatory gray area has created a loophole that put Illinois consumers of all ages, but particularly children, in danger while an underground market flourished—the exact opposite of what Illinois has done by regulating our cannabis industry,” Pritzker said in a December 2024 news release.

But lawmakers failed again to pass legislation regulating intoxicating hemp this year, leaving the industry in limbo until either the state acts or the federal government intervenes first. It marked the third consecutive year that a regulatory bill failed, the latest front in a legislative fight that largely pits the state’s legalized cannabis industry against its industrial hemp growers.

Hemp vs. cannabis: What’s the difference?

Both hemp and cannabis come from the same plant and contain a level of THC that can cause a high if ingested. The most important difference, however, is in the concentration of THC. Compared to cannabis, hemp has a much lower amount of naturally occurring THC.

By federal law, if a plant has a concentration of 0.3% THC or less by dry weight, it is legally considered hemp. If it has any more than 0.3% THC, it is considered cannabis.

Both substances were strictly regulated as “Schedule 1” drugs under the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970 until the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, which removed hemp from the legal definition of cannabis, thus creating a fully legal hemp market.

But the farm bill only established a threshold for delta-9 THC, the primary cannabinoid found in cannabis. There is no explicit threshold for hemp-derived delta-8, which is created through additional chemical processing after hemp is harvested.

Unlike cannabis products containing THC, which must meet strict regulatory requirements in Illinois and other states that have legalized recreational and medical cannabis, the intoxicating hemp market is currently unregulated and lacks oversight at both the state and federal level to ensure products are responsibly produced, marketed and sold to consumers.

For example, there is no minimum age required to purchase hemp products, making it relatively easy for young consumers to access intoxicating hemp compared to cannabis.

A recent study from the University of Illinois System Institute of Government and Public Affairs released in May found credible evidence that hemp-derived THC products are intentionally marketed and readily available to teens and young adults through online sales and convenience stores.

At least 32 states have responded by passing legislation to increase regulations, or in California’s case, ban intoxicating hemp altogether.

Should it be regulated or banned?

The Wards have grown hemp on their sixth-generation farm since it was legalized in 2018. They’re in the camp that would like to see the intoxicating hemp industry more strictly regulated but not outright banned.

As president of the Illinois Healthy Alternatives Association, a trade association and lobbying group for hemp farmers, Justin Ward has made regular trips to Springfield to advocate for increased hemp regulation.

According to Ward, new regulations should include state-mandated testing to ensure hemp products are compliant with federal regulations and free of toxic contaminants, sold in child-safe packaging and labeling, and have a minimum age requirement at point-of-sale.

“Everything we grow meets that standard,” Ward said. At Stoney Branch Farms, the Wards sell both non-intoxicating and intoxicating forms of hemp, including delta-8. They said the cultivation, processing, packaging and marketing of their products is all done in-house.

Every crop at Stoney Branch goes through a pre-harvest THC potency test by a federal sampling agent, in addition to a post-processing test by a third party to ensure the final products are free of contaminants. The products are then sold online in child-safe packaging to consumers 21 years old or above.

A bill to make these standards law in Illinois, House Bill 1, was proposed this year with the support of hemp lobbyists, but continued disagreement among stakeholders over the details of licensing, taxation and the legal potency threshold of delta-8 THC caused the bill to stall without being called for a vote, according to the bill’s sponsor Rep. La Shawn Ford, D-Chicago.

Municipalities are free to ban the sale of hemp-derived products as they see fit, and many have; in Chicago, the City Council has approved bans specific to some wards.

The state’s legalized cannabis industry, which saw its first sales in January 2020, has at times called for an outright ban on delta-8. The industry maintains it’s willing to work toward a solution.

Tiffany Chappell Ingram, executive director of the Cannabis Business Association of Illinois, said in a recent statement that regulations are needed to “rein in” intoxicating hemp. She argues that the hemp industry unfairly undercuts licensed cannabis operators, evades health and safety regulations and generates little revenue for state programs due to its low tax rate.

“We’ve been at this for years at this point, but we’ve got a lot of great allies in the legislature.” Ward said. “This hasn’t been banned yet because they’ve listened to us.”

Opposition from cannabis crowd 

The state’s cannabis industry argues intoxicating hemp is not distinct enough from cannabis to have its own license category and far fewer barriers to entry and operation.

For example, while a three-year license for hemp only costs $1,100, including initial licensing fees, a license for cannabis costs $100,000 just to apply for a large adult-use cultivation license, then another $100,000 when the license is granted and each time it’s renewed. The state caps large-scale adult-use cultivation centers to 21 licenses, and has issued fewer than 100 smaller-scale “craft grow” licenses at a cost of $40,000.

When hemp was legalized, many who couldn’t gain entry to the cannabis industry took it as an opportunity to produce a similar product without all the red tape.

“Part of the reason we were drawn to hemp is the lower barriers of entry to get into this in comparison to the cannabis industry,” Ward said.

Hemp is also taxed at a much lower rate than cannabis, allowing the industry to price its products more competitively. Cannabis revenues, by comparison, are hurt by stricter taxation and regulatory compliance, according to the University of Illinois report.




Stoney Branch Farms co-founders Justin and Anna Ward say that while the hemp industry is booming, regulating it the same as cannabis would be a massive blow to their farm. “If we could just get some sensible regulation, I think that it would help a lot of business owners feel confident enough to really put their whole weight behind their business,” Anna Ward said. (Isabella Schoonover, Medill Illinois News Bureau)


Social equity cannabis licenses are available at lower costs to those who have been impacted by the state’s prior criminalization of cannabis, including those previously convicted of cannabis related offenses, but the industry is still far from accessible.

Ford, who spearheads the issue of hemp and cannabis regulation each year, said it’s important to balance promises made to current social equity cannabis license holders with any concessions made for hemp.

Ward said he supports easing regulations on cannabis to make the industry more accessible in Illinois, while also keeping hemp accessible through “sensible” regulations.

“We want regulations to protect consumers and weed out bad actors, but we don't want to see this thing regulated to death,” Ward said.

Legislature divided on regulation

The state legislature hasn’t been able to settle the question of whether to regulate hemp-derived products containing delta-8 THC as distinct from medicinal and recreational cannabis, or to treat them as virtually the same substance.

The issue caused a rift among House Democrats earlier this year, and despite continued discussions during the spring legislative session, lawmakers have still not come to a consensus.

A proposal backed by Pritzker in the 2024 session, House Bill 4293, to legally define hemp as cannabis, would have made it illegal to sell hemp without a cannabis license. Hemp lobbyists strongly opposed that measure, fearing it would shut them out and give cannabis license holders a monopoly over the cannabinoid market.

Pritzker ultimately blamed House Speaker Chris Welch for killing that bill in January. Despite bipartisan support, Welch said at the time the measure didn’t have enough votes within his Democratic ranks to pass. A spokesperson for Welch promised at the time that he would continue to work toward hemp regulation throughout the legislative session.

A spokesperson for the speaker declined to comment on why hemp regulations still didn’t advance. Both hemp and cannabis lobbies have donated tens of thousands of dollars to Welch’s campaign, Ford’s and others over the last several years in the legislative blitz surrounding the various regulatory bills.

Ward said Ford has been one of the hemp lobby’s biggest allies. Ford conducted meetings all session among lawmakers, the governor’s office and industry stakeholders in an effort to find common ground.




In many convenience stores that sell hemp, the products are behind the counter, even though it’s not illegal to sell hemp products to minors. These packages are also labeled “21+” and “keep out of reach of children.” Critics say the design, modeled after Sour Patch Kids, is intentionally designed to appeal to children. (Simon Carr, Medill Illinois News Bureau)



“We have two competing industries, and we already have existing businesses, and existing businesses are not interested in just losing their operations,” Ford said.

While closed-door conversations surrounding hemp regulations have continued, there has yet to be a public hearing on hemp. Rep. Sonya Harper, D-Chicago, who chairs the House agriculture committee, said the speaker had not responded to her requests for such a hearing.

“I just want to actually make sure that the voices of those most impacted are heard,” Harper said.

Likelihood of future hemp regulation 

Though there’s been significant pressure from Pritzker and some advocacy groups to regulate hemp in Illinois, Ford said he’s not inclined to rush the process, arguing it needs broader bipartisan support.

“We had a problem when we regulated cannabis: we sort of rushed it, and we didn't have stakeholders all at the table,” Ford said. “Some Republicans would say that they were not a part of it.”

A number of Republicans have recently joined negotiations over hemp legislation. But a compromise still seems far off.  Rep. C.D. Davidsmeyer, R-Murrayville, who’s been leading that effort, said Republicans are unlikely to support anything but closing the intoxicating hemp loophole.

Davidsmeyer said he opposes the double standard for cannabis license holders versus hemp.

“If you're going to have a standard, you have everybody in the same industry going by the same rules,” he said.

A spokesperson from the governor’s office said his position has not changed since he called for greater regulation.

“I think that it's agreed that, from the speaker of the House, the governor and the Republicans and myself, and the industry, everyone agrees that we should regulate this,” Ford said. “Over the months, we should be able to get something. It's a priority.”

Federal changes coming?  

A bill that would end this hemp loophole at the federal level passed through the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday, July 10. If that bill becomes law, the cultivation and sale of hemp products containing “quantifiable amounts” of THC would once again be prohibited under federal law, rolling back the previous allowance of 0.3%.

This would deal a devastating blow to the more than $400 million U.S. hemp industry.

One of the most common forms of hemp sold in the U.S. is cannabidiol, or CBD, a non-intoxicating cannabinoid which is marketed as a therapeutic alternative for the treatment of conditions like insomnia, inflammation and seizure disorders.

“That's a big focus of our business still, is people who are looking for some of the therapeutic benefits that cannabis can provide without a high,” Ward said.

Because CBD almost always still has trace amounts of THC, proposals to ban any “quantifiable amount” of THC could result in the prohibition of CBD products. “I think we really do a disservice to a great number of consumers in Illinois by doing that,” Ward said.

(Photo by Tony Webster/Wisconsin Fair Maps Coalition)With court-ordered maps that have made more Wisconsin legislative races competitive for both political parties, pro-democracy advocates are turning back to a longstanding objective: a permanent change in how the maps are drawn.
Instead of state lawmakers who are currently in charge, political reform groups are organizing to move the task to a new, independent commission that would draw Assembly and Senate districts every 10 years, following the new U.S. census, in ways that reflect Wisconsin’s close political divide.
“Our goal is to have a more accountable legislative body,” says Iuscely Flores, organizing director for the Wisconsin Fair Maps Coalition.
A change will require an amendment to the Wisconsin Constitution, which currently assigns the task of drawing legislative districts to the Wisconsin Legislature.
Until 2011, the state’s redistricting process generally went well for nearly half a century, according to Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause Wisconsin. The Legislature was closely divided between Republicans and Democrats. Regardless of the governor’s party, the other party usually had a slim majority in either the Senate or the Assembly.
“It was split control,” says Heck. “Redistricting was usually incumbent protection, but it wasn’t particularly partisan.”
The 2010 election in Wisconsin changed that, with Republicans for the first time in a half-century getting control of the governor’s mansion and both houses of the Legislature.
In 2011 the lawmakers drew what became widely recognized as one of the most gerrymandered legislative maps in the country. “They picked the most partisan maps they could,” says Heck.
The 2012 election showed the impact: Wisconsin voters reelected Democratic President Barack Obama to a second term and sent another Democrat, Tammy Baldwin, to the U.S. Senate. And 51% of the votes for the Wisconsin Assembly were for Democratic candidates. Yet Republicans won 60 of the 99 seats in the lower house.
In the years that followed, Common Cause, the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign and the League of Women Voters all took up the cause of putting redistricting in the hands of an independent body, arguing that a group of citizens drawn from across the political spectrum could more accurately reflect the state’s true political makeup.
While the idea gained public support, it got the cold shoulder from the Legislature’s majority.
Then came the maps drawn after the 2020 census, approved in 2022 following a legal battle that was settled by the conservative majority in the Wisconsin Supreme Court. Those maps further solidified a lopsided balance between the parties in the Legislature.
In 2023, voters flipped the Court’s balance from conservative and aligned with the Republican party (although the justices are officially nonpartisan) to a majority elected with the support of the Democratic Party. For reform advocates, the switch presented a new opportunity, and the focus turned to a lawsuit challenging how the 2022 maps were drawn.
The outcome of that lawsuit in 2024 produced maps that more closely reflected the narrow partisan divide in the states. In the 2024 elections, Democrats picked up four state Senate seats, erasing a GOP supermajority, and added 14 seats in the Assembly.
While those maps were closer to fair, however, a larger problem remains, reform groups argue: the Wisconsin Constitution gives the lawmakers the ultimate power to draw their districts in ways that preserve their political advantage.
The process for amending the state constitution requires lawmakers to vote on a proposal in two successive legislative sessions, then for voters to endorse the amendment in a statewide referendum. That means a little more than four years must pass before the change could be instituted.
Flores says the coalition is keeping an eye on that timeline, with plans to engage lawmakers from both parties next year in order to get legislation introduced and passed.
“We have to fix this permanently — that is what we are now focused on,” says Penny Bernard Schaber, leader for the Fair Maps Coalition’s team in the 8th Congressional District. “We want to put both parties on notice that we need to fix what we are doing.”
Even as the maps lawsuit was underway, advocates for bigger change were continuing to meet and organize, Flores says. And after the Court ruling and the adoption of the new, fairer maps, the work for an independent redistricting body kicked into higher gear.
An ad hoc committee on redistricting reform met monthly and later more often over the last year, with participants drilling down into alternatives for structuring independent redistricting bodies.
“We were able to really study how independent redistricting commissions in other states really worked,” Flores says.
“We looked at every single state that has an independent commission,” says Debra Cronmiller, executive director of the League of Women Voters of Wisconsin. There were conversations with academics and other groups that draw legislative maps.
“We tried to glean from all of that information what would work best for Wisconsin,” Cronmiller said.
The Wisconsin Fair Maps Coalition has drawn up a draft for how a Wisconsin commission might work, but Flores emphasizes that it’s still a work in progress.
The coalition has begun a series of community hearings to engage the public, explain the concept and refine the details. Hearings were held in the Milwaukee North Shore suburbs in June and in Dodgeville on July 12.
On Wednesday evening, there will be a hearing in Green Bay at the Brown County Central Library starting at 5:30 p.m. On Thursday one is scheduled for Wausau, and more meetings are planned through the summer and into the fall.
“We’re trying to get community input,” Flores says. “There are questions we still don’t know the answers to, and we’re learning so much  — it’s been an amazing, citizen-led process that I don’t think I’ve seen before.”
The groups and individuals working on the project are considering “how to make sure that the commission accurately reflects and represents the people of Wisconsin — how to make sure that we incorporate people from different political backgrounds, different ethnicities,” Flores adds. “We’re trying to be what Wisconsin looks like.”

Mike Braun signs the budget bill into law from his Statehouse office on Tuesday, May 6, 2025. (From Braun's official X account)Indiana’s latest biennial budget — the first under new Gov. Mike Braun — effectively lowers state spending by 7% after inflation and an across-the-board holdback policy, the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute found in a Monday budget analysis.
The $54.6 billion House Enrolled Act 1001, approved in May, spends 3% more than its $53 billion predecessor from 2023. But the state’s spending power has sunk 5% since then.
And, the Office of Management and Budget was authorized to make the State Budget Agency withhold an additional 5% from what most agencies were allotted.
Those two factors will “result in a dramatic decrease in actual spending” compared to the last budget, according to the independent, Indianapolis-based institute.
Some agencies will feel the strain more than others.
50+ state employees laid off as Indiana budget cuts take effect

A grim revenue forecast left lawmakers with just a week to chop $2 billion in spending off the budget. Most agencies — but not all — saw their allocations shrink 5%.
But it’s not all about the forecast, the institute asserted.
“These decreases in spending … must also be viewed in the context of the reality that Indiana continues to lower taxes, even this year,” the analysis argued.
Not only will that “likely make it harder to provide state and local services at previous levels,” but “the priorities shown in how the cuts were implemented are telling.”
K-12 education funding, long touted as the biggest chunk of the budget, saw a modest bump of 4% to $20.6 billion. The 5% holdback policy outweighs any gains, however.
The budget’s largest single line item is the $19 billion for K-12 tuition support. When accounting for inflation it has remained flat for “the last several” budget cycles, according to the analysis.
K-12 spending beyond tuition support was dealt a “structural reduction.”
For instance, $320 million to cover the cost of free textbooks was eliminated. The $25 million in charter school capital grants was also scrapped — but those entities will instead siphon property tax revenue off traditional public schools under a separate local funding plan.
Such funding decisions “will have a significant impact on schools and Hoosier students,” the institute predicted.
The deepest cuts, proportionally, were reserved for a collection of commerce agencies.
The controversial Indiana Economic Development Corporation saw a non-adjusted 30% decrease. Several line items were zeroed out, including career connections funding, direct flight subsidies, industrial development grants, manufacturing readiness grants and a skills enhancement fund.
The Department of Workforce Development was dealt a non-adjusted 27% reduction — and will absorb the work of the eliminated Governor’s Workforce Cabinet. The Indiana Destination Development Corporation was also slashed.

That prompted the institute to ask: “What is the State of Indiana’s economic strategy in light of this divestment?” alongside questions about business leader attitudes, higher-wage job opportunities and innovation.
Other government verticals experiencing double-digit percentage cuts include business affairs, the lieutenant governor and the secretary of state. Construction was allotted more than 60% less money, too.
Some agencies bucked the trend.
The Family and Social Services Administration, Department of Child Services and Indiana Department of Health each got more, collectively realizing a non-adjusted 17% increase.
Most prominent is the $1.8 billion boost to Medicaid assistance, which FSSA oversees.
FSSA, DCS and the Indiana Department of Correction can also tap into a $300 million “Financial Responsibility and Opportunity Growth Fund,” under the Management and Budget vertical, with State Budget Committee approval.
Indiana State Police are set for a 28% budget increase to pay for significant salary increases. They’re aimed at improving recruitment and retention amid staffing shortages.
Many of the budget’s provisions went into effect July 1, with the beginning of the 2026 state fiscal year.

(Photo by Clark Corbin/Idaho Capital Sun)Idaho Department of Lands officials are considering proposing a bill during the 2026 legislative session that would increase the fire protection surcharge for lots with residential structures on forest lands to pay for fire protection programs.
Idaho Department of Lands Deputy Director Bill Haagenson briefed Gov. Brad Little and members of the Idaho Board of Land Commissioners on the proposed bill during a meeting Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.
Idaho wildfire potential remains high as hot temperatures continue 

Under current state law, the owners of forest lands with residential structures pay a $40 annual surcharge for fire protection, which has not increased since 2009. The new proposal would allow the state to increase the surcharge, not to exceed $100 for each improved lot or parcel to offset the cost of fire preparedness.
Haagenson told Little and the Land Board that the current $40 annual surcharge is not enough to support the state’s fire protection program, particularly as Idaho continues to grow and more homes are built in areas where human development and forest lands meet. 
“The proposal is to change the improved particle surcharge from $40 to up to $100 and that change is needed to ensure funding for the future of healthy wildfire protection,” Haggenson said.
About 67,000 parcels of land in forests in Idaho are subject to the surcharge, Haagenson said. If the state raised the surcharge to $100, that would generate about $4 million more per year in funding for wildfires, state officials said. 
Little and Land Board members voted to approve the proposal, with the potential for Idaho Department of Lands officials to make further revisions or withdraw it entirely. That means the department can move forward with the proposal but may change it or decide not to bring it forward.
For the change to take effect, the proposal would need to be introduced as a bill during an upcoming session of the Idaho Legislature, receive a majority of votes in both the Idaho Senate and Idaho House of Representatives and be signed into law by the governor. 
The 2026 legislative session is scheduled to begin Jan. 12 in Boise.

A Bridger-Teton nonprofit created the team of former federal staffers in the wake of DOGE cuts to assist depleted Forest Service field crews. 
The post All-female ‘Forest Corps’ fills federal agency gaps for Wyoming trail projects appeared first on WyoFile .","Monica Elliot joined the U.S. Forest Service last year when she was hired to work on a backcountry trail crew based in Pinedale. Clinching the job felt big, she said. 
“I found so much value and love and purpose in trail work and working with the outdoors,” she said. “So having this permanent seasonal gig was kind of like the entryway into having a career out of it.”
Then came Feb. 14, when a wave of federal-employee layoffs swept the nation, resulting in chaos and uncertainty at agencies like the Forest Service. Elliot was among employees with so-called permanent seasonal positions, a categorization that was axed wholesale. She was suddenly out of a summer gig. 
“It was a huge bummer,” Elliot said. 
She spent a couple months casting about for work until her fortunes reversed once more. Friends of the Bridger-Teton, a nonprofit that helps the Bridger-Teton National Forest manage growing crowds with initiatives like volunteer ambassadors, created what it dubbed the “Forest Corps” in response to the federal layoffs. The team was designed explicitly to help the agency on summer-season field projects.  
And Elliot was tapped as the crew lead and program manager — a job that combined her passions for trail and nonprofit work. 
“Which worked out really well for me,” she said.

In the months since, the Forest Corps has acted as an auxiliary crew for the 3.4 million acre Bridger-Teton National Forest. The five-woman team has communicated with each of the vast forest’s six districts to identify a high-impact project it can assist on. 
The crew used handsaws to help clear dozens of trees from heavily used trails in the Pinedale District’s Bridger Wilderness. They painted front-country picnic tables, installed a puncheon trail over marshy terrain in the Blackrock District, cleared deadfall and opened up 15 miles of trail in the Pack Creek burn area near Togwotee Pass.  
“So with the way the schedule worked out, each district basically got us for one big project,” she said. 
One one hand, it’s only five people. But for national forest district offices that were already stretched thin before the federal government further shrunk staff, the Forest Corps has been welcome help. 
“They’ve been really happy so far,” Elliot said. “Just any help is really nice for them.”
Temporary band-aid 
Without entrance gates or crowd counters, it’s difficult to pin down exact visitation numbers on Wyoming’s 9 million acres of national forest, but managers agree visitation has mushroomed in recent years. 
While the growth has fueled issues like improper human waste disposal, user-created roads, wildlife conflicts and vegetation damage, the federal agency that oversees the lands has faced limited budgets and staff. Since the 1990s, the Forest Service has experienced a major reduction in staffing across nearly all types of jobs.
That’s where Friends of the Bridger-Teton comes in. The nonprofit aims to assist the agency in managing visitor impacts in the huge — and hugely popular — destination of the Bridger-Teton National Forest. Until this year, however, initiatives were fueled more by volunteers — such as ambassadors who educate campers on things like extinguishing campfires and securing food from bears. 
Seeing the Forest Service further hobbled by the February job cuts and frozen funds spurred the nonprofit to do more, Friends of the Bridger-Teton Executive Director Scott Kosiba said. 
“We recognize that staff capacity within the Bridger-Teton National Forest is really limited this year, particularly with field staff,” Kosiba said. The Forest Corps was born from the desire to assist.

The Bridger-Teton National Forest fired roughly 40 employees across western Wyoming, the Jackson Hole News&Guide reported, though some of those positions were later reinstated. 
The Friends nonprofit launched a specific fundraising campaign that has raised more than $50,000 to fund the Forest Corps initiative. Partners like Trout Unlimited and the Wyoming Wilderness Association have chipped in, and the bulk of funds have come from private donors, Kosiba said. 
They are still raising money for the program, which is estimated to total $180,000.
Friends of the Bridger-Teton hired five women who all formerly worked for the federal agency, and the team has collaborated with district officials on projects the federal agencies need more capacity to complete. 
Projects, or “hitches,” have ranged from quotidian to rugged, Elliot said. The Greys River District had been storing new frontcountry signs for that it didn’t have the manpower to install, so the Forest Corps helped put them up. On the other end of the spectrum, the crew ventured deep into the Wyoming Range in the Big Piney District to clear deadfall from trails in stunning and seldom-visited terrain.  
It’s been a great experience to serve on an all-female crew that’s providing tangible relief, Elliot said. But she warned against the presumption that this approach is a silver bullet. 
“It’s not a solution,” Elliot said. “It’s just a band-aid. All of us would have been working for the Forest Service had it not been for the cuts. So there’s really no new numbers being added.” 
On a four-day hitch in the Pinedale District’s Bridger Wilderness, the Forest Corps crew cleared 35 trees using crosscut and hand saws — mechanized equipment is not allowed in designated wilderness areas — and cleared more than 50 drains. (Courtesy) 
Kosiba echoed that. Even though he can see the Forest Corps becoming a lasting initiative of the nonprofit, he said, “there is no reality where private industry or a nonprofit can or should step into the role of the federal government or dedicated civil service.” 
Drop in the bucket
Though the crew is assisting on high-priority projects, Kosiba said, it’s a small dent given the significant backlog of work to be done on the forest. 
“The work that this crew is going to be able to do this summer is really a drop in the bucket,” Kosiba said.
With staff reductions and the Forest Corps crew spread thin across the Bridger-Teton’s vast federal lands, the public will still encounter unfortunate impacts on access and maintenance on Wyoming’s public lands, he said. 
Meantime, the uncertainty continues for federal workers whipsawed by layoffs and subsequent reinstatements. The latest twist came last week, when the U.S. Supreme Court removed a block on reductions in force planned across most federal agencies. Now, employees and observers anticipate further cuts.
Forest Service spokespeople were unable to provide comment by publication time.

Growing up on a ranch surrounded by serpents has its benefits, columnist Rod Miller writes.
The post A lesson from rattlesnake ranch appeared first on WyoFile .","I grew up in the densest concentration of pit vipers on the planet. I shared my home with literally millions of rattlesnakes.

Opinion

The ID ranch, my early home north of Rawlins, features a long chain of dry mountains called the Haystacks that runs south to north through our winter range. The Haystacks are about 10 miles long, and are incised with a dozen deep canyons that run east to west. The parent stone in the Haystacks is sandstone, and the fractures in it are many and deep.
Over eons, cold-blooded rattlesnakes have evolved to learn that they can survive the bitterest of winters if they den up in those deep fractures. Thermal inertia deep underground keeps ‘em warm and toasty while everything on the surface freezes hard and cold.
In the late 1970s, a couple of University of Wyoming biologists came out to the ID to study our buzztails. Dr. Dave Duval and his sidekick, Mike King, lived in a sheep wagon that I hauled up to the Haystacks for their headquarters. Mike and Dave spent a few years researching rattlesnake behavior, and I learned a lot from them.
They both helped us move and work cattle when they weren’t chasing danger noodles and developed into fair-to-middlin’ cowhands. I taught them some cowboying, and they taught me a lot about a critter that had occupied the landscape for a lot longer than humans.

(Mike Vanata)
Our prairie rattlesnakes — or if you want to be fancy Crotalus viridis viridis —  are the only rattlesnakes in Wyoming except for the midget faded, a nasty little booger that only lives along the Green River. While they are fierce predators, prairie rattlesnakes are purely defensive when confronted with something too big to eat.
They can meter their venom so that, when they bite a prey species, it dies on the spot and they don’t have to chase it on their bellies through the cactus. But when they bite a human, horse or cow, they only inject enough venom to back it off.
An old hand who worked at the ID when I was a kid, Fred Wise, had been bitten several times. His advice was to shade up or lie in a creek to cool the body if a snake bit us and then drink a bottle of whiskey. The next morning, the hangover would make the pain of the snakebite pale to insignificance.
Readers are admonished to heed Fred’s advice at their own peril; I’m only passing along what he told me.
There are probably a couple hundred rattlesnake dens on the ID, and each den can shelter tens of thousands of snakes. Riding horseback in those canyons, I was treated to stereophonic rattling. I got pretty good at killing snakes without dismounting my horse, swinging my rope to cold-cock ‘em with the honda.
But I stopped killing rattlesnakes after talking with those snake wranglin’ apprentice cowboys from UW.
Their research showed that snakes would emerge from their dens when the days got warm. They’d sun themselves to heat their blood, then they’d beeline out into the sagebrush flats to gorge themselves on white-footed deer mice, their meat of choice. They’d spend all summer eating rodents, then wander back to the den to sleep for another winter.
That, to me, seems like a pretty unexciting life for the serpents that stalk us in our nightmares, but that’s what rattlesnakes do.
I stopped killing rattlesnakes because Duval and King taught me about the eating habits of the white-footed deer mouse. They are ravenous little vermin, and eat a couple times their body weight in grass a day. And they outnumber both cows and snakes by a huuuuge margin. The only thing that puts a dent in their population is rattlesnakes.
Duval and King sat me down one day and showed me the math. If we had zero rattlesnakes on the ID, we could maybe run only a dozen cows. The goddam mice would eat all the grass on what otherwise is fine cow country. I could raise more beef with rattlesnakes around than without ‘em. So, I quit killing rattlesnakes.
Mind you, I never tamed a snake for a pet, or even got accustomed to the primordial shiver in my amygdala when I heard one rattle. But I quit killing them, for the sake of my cows.
It’s just one of those little life lessons that sneak up on us from time to time — one of those secret truths hidden under the sagebrush in the Big Empty. Everything is connected to everything else.

A new Democratic Party website uses key talking points from Donald Trump's 2024 campaign against the president and his policies. (Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)Aiming to use President Donald Trump’s signature policies against him, Democrats unveiled a website Wednesday that depicts their purported costs to taxpayers in each state.
The TrumpTax.com website draws on projections from the Congressional Budget Office and other sources as it advances the argument that the mega-bill passed by Republicans in the U.S. House and Senate and signed into law by Trump on July 4 “takes money out of working people’s pockets to give handouts to the rich.”
The campaign combines the impact of Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff declarations with the mega-bill to derive a so-called “Trump Tax,” generating state-by-state calculations for the data.
“The Trump Tax will explode the deficit by $3.3 trillion — leading to higher inflation, higher energy bills, and higher grocery and prescription drug costs,” the website states — pinpointing specific messages about consumer pocketbook issues that were key talking points during Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign.
The site lists all 50 U.S. states with a drop-down list of bullet points for each.
In Wisconsin, the campaign projects 276,000 people will lose health insurance over the next decade. The number is calculated from changes to the Medicaid program that have been projected to cut some recipients off from the state-federal health insurance plan for the poor, along with the end of premium subsidies for low or moderate income households that purchase health insurance from the Affordable Care Act online marketplace.
It projects 49,000 Wisconsinites could lose food assistance through SNAP, the federal nutrition program and pegs the cost to Wisconsin businesses to date of Trump administration tariff policies at more than $900 million, citing calculations published in Axios.
“The Trump Tax is the largest redistribution of wealth and the largest cut to health care in Wisconsin history,” Democratic National Committee Chair Kenneth Martin said in a statement with the unveiling of the website.

(John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)By the time the 9-year-old boy arrived in their foster home, he had been in the custody of the Tennessee Department of Children’s Services for more than half his life, separated from four siblings and shunted through more than 20 foster homes.
Alisa and Brian said at first they had no intention of adopting the boy, who was around the same age as their biological son. 
Six months later, he was calling them “mom” and “dad.” He had behavioral problems: he sometimes hoarded food and wet the bed — nothing Alisa, a seasoned social worker, couldn’t handle. They loved him. With the promise of ongoing adoption support from the state, he was theirs. 
Then the trauma their adopted son had endured, including physical and sexual abuse his adoptive mother said he suffered in foster care, began to manifest in ways the couple found increasingly difficult to handle on their own.
He threatened his family with a knife, she said, recounting other incidents: He wrapped an electric cord around his brother’s neck. He headbutted his mother, drawing blood. He exposed himself to other children. He ran.
Lawsuit: ‘Tennessee’s foster care system is failing children it is intended to protect’

For the past 16 months, the now 13-year-old teen has been receiving treatment at a Tennessee facility that contracts with the state to provide psychiatric care to children with violent and sexually aggressive behavior. The boy, like his parents, is not identified in this story to protect his privacy as a victim of child sex abuse. 
On Thursday, he is due to be discharged against his family’s wishes, according to emails with the facility and TennCare reviewed by the Lookout. There is no way to safely bring him back home, Alisa said this week. 
Barring intervention, the boy will once again become a ward of the state, an email from the family’s attorney acknowledging DCS’ plans show. Once taken into state custody, the boy would rejoin a system with more than 8,000 children already stretched to the breaking point. Children coming into foster care with complex behavioral and medical needs are among the agency’s biggest challenges, DCS Commissioner Margie Quin has repeatedly told lawmakers over the past two years.
Alisa and Bryan don’t want to lose their son. They said they have spent months trying to find alternatives to get him the care he needs while keeping their other son safe.
“I love him. His entire life has been nothing but chaos,” she said. “And now these terrible systems will continue to damage him even more.”
After meeting with DCS officials to request additional adoption assistance that could help pay for an alternative residential facility or in-home caretakers, DCS notified Alisa and Brian it had initiated child abandonment proceedings against them once the couple made clear they would not be able to pick up their son without more support, according to their attorney, Emily Jenkins of the Tennessee Justice Center.
The proceedings could cost the couple more than their son. Findings of child abandonment would remain on the couple’s record and could also jeopardize Alisa’s license to practice as a social worker. 
‘Outside their scope of coverage and not medically necessary’
Child advocates in Tennessee have long cited instances of children being placed in foster care due to a lack of safety net services — a pathway that often begins with the denial of coverage for a child’s complex medical and psychiatric needs by TennCare or private insurance and ends in foster care.
For Alisa and Brian’s family, private insurance for several months split the cost of care at their son’s residential facility with TennCare, which provides secondary health insurance to children adopted from foster care.

In December, the family’s private insurance stopped paying for the residential care, leaving TennCare solely responsible for the child’s medical bills, his mother said.
“By February, Tenncare was already pushing to discharge him, to which I said he was unstable,” Alisa said. “We were still getting reports he had to be restrained.”
By May, Alisa and Brian were shocked to hear that the facility caring for their son intended to send him home, with little follow up care beyond a referral to a psychiatrist who does not accept either TennCare or their private insurance, emails from Jenkins to DCS and TennCare detailing the boy’s care history show.  
“They wouldn’t even give him a day pass, because of his behaviors,” Alisa said. “Now they want to send him back with no transition plan whatsoever.”
Citing their son’s need for ongoing care, the couple reached out to TennCare for help, but agency officials declined to cover an alternative residential treatment center, group home or 24-7 in-home aid that could protect both of the couple’s children, the attorney’s emails detailed — services TennCare can make available to children diagnosed with intellectual disabilities who are a danger to themselves or others.
TennCare said these alternative services were “outside their scope of coverage and not medically necessary,” Alisa said, noting her son does not have an intellectual disability.
Alisa also identified an alternative residential care facility willing to take her son, but it, too, fell outside the TennCare insurance network available to the family.
A spokesperson for TennCare was provided a signed release from the family to discuss their child’s care with the Lookout but declined to comment. 
“Because this member has engaged legal counsel, we will not be providing comment other than to say it is not accurate that TennCare or the member’s (TennCare managed care organization) has denied treatment or coverage,” the statement said.  
Class action complaint accuses Tennessee Department of Children’s Services of abusing disabled kids

“Rather, the provider is discharging after determining he completed treatment and no longer needs residential services,” it said. 
The couple turned to DCS to see if they could provide further adoption assistance to help them pay for residential care. The state’s adoption assistance program is designed to provide support to families caring for high-needs adopted children in order to keep them from returning to state custody. 
But those meetings led nowhere, Alisa said. 
Last week, the family’s attorney reached out directly to Quin, the DCS chief. 
“We have been pleading with DCS and TennCare for months to step in and help this family build the scaffolding needed to ensure that (their son) can transition safely back into the community,” read the email from Jenkins.
Without assistance to the family, “he will reenter custody of the very department that placed him in settings where he suffered abuse,” she wrote. 
Jenkins received no response, she said Tuesday.
A DCS spokesperson declined to answer questions about the case or whether Quin had directly reviewed it. Provided a signed release form from the family authorizing DCS officials to speak to the Lookout about the case, the spokesperson responded with directions to submit a public records request for the family’s file.  
Through their attorney, the family also reached out to the Tennessee Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services for help finding alternatives but have received no offers of assistance from them, either. 
DCS seeks $189M in new funding with plans to target rural counties with high foster care rates

“These parents adopted based on the promise of Tennessee that they would have access to services,” Jenkins said. “The people who have abandoned (their son) are DCS, TennCare and the Department of Mental Health.”
“They have been lockstep coordinated in their absolute negligence and abandonment of their duties to ensure that the children in Tennessee get the care they need and avoid entry into a system that DCS acknowledges is not capable of meeting complex mental health needs of children,” she said.
Alisa said her goal is for her son to make a gradual transition back to their home in the future — but only with support.
Child development experts the family consulted at the Vanderbilt University Center for Excellence for Children in State Custody provided detailed recommendations that include a gradual reintroduction to the family through weekend visits, family therapy, in-home services, a safety plan and coordination with the therapist treating their biological son, who was physically abused by his adoptive brother. 
Alisa says they have not been offered these options and questions how state agencies will provide care to her son. She also described the pain she and her husband experienced being notified in a meeting with DCS officials that they would be subject to child abandonment charges.

But for working parents, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, summer is one of the most financially stressful times of the year.

[…]","Rent, utilities, and child care don’t take a vacation, and families often face costs they can't absorb when school is out, writes guest columnist Katie Amidan. (Getty Images)For many, summer evokes images of vacations, barbecues and family time. But for working parents, especially those living paycheck to paycheck, summer is one of the most financially stressful times of the year.
As housing and living costs rise nationwide, a less-discussed reality is that summer often pushes families to the edge of housing instability. Rent, utilities, and child care don’t take a vacation, but school does. And when classrooms close for three months, so do the critical support systems families rely on to stay afloat.
Child care costs pose a significant challenge for many parents, especially in summer. For families assisted by Jesse Tree, a nonprofit serving Ada and Canyon counties with homelessness prevention, child care ranks among their highest expenses. Parents often face full-time care costs they can’t absorb when school is out. Summer camps range from $500 to $1,800 per child, per session. Camps are often short-term, leaving families scrambling for coverage the rest of the summer, and even one session is too costly for low-income families. 
Food access becomes more uncertain during the summer. During the school year, many children access free or reduced-price breakfast and lunch programs. When those meals disappear, families are forced to stretch already tight grocery budgets. The connection between housing instability and basic needs like food is clear. Between January and June 2025, Jesse Tree surveyed 469 clients – over 52% reported “always, often, or sometimes” struggling with food insecurity. While some programs like the Boys and Girls Club provide free weekday meals to kids during the summer, families still face logistical challenges around getting their children to and from these sites while juggling jobs and transportation costs.
Transportation costs spike in the summer. According to KTVB, Idaho gas prices jumped 21 cents in one week. For working families, commuting, grocery shopping, and childcare can quickly become unaffordable. On top of that, utility bills rise as air conditioners hum through long, hot days, and Idaho Power proposed to increase rates by an additional 7-8% this summer (Idaho Press). This steady rise in utility and gas expenses impacts lower-income families who can barely make ends meet.
The deeper issue is systemic. Our economic and housing infrastructure isn’t built to support families through seasonal disruptions. The school year provides more than education. It offers structure, nutrition, safety, and predictability. Once school ends, the stability it offers fades, and there are minimal resources, like public care subsidies, offered in its place. Affordable housing remains scarce. Employers often lack family-friendly flexibility, and public benefits remain inflexible and underfunded.
If we’re serious about supporting families, we need policies that address the year-round realities they face. That includes expanding funding for summer meal programs, subsidized child care, and affordable housing. We need employers to adopt flexible scheduling and remote work options, support paid family leave, and embrace child tax credits that ease seasonal burdens.
We must stop treating summer as a luxury season. For millions of working parents, it’s a financial emergency. And no season, especially one meant for growth and play, should come at the cost of housing security.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” and tariffs are set to cost the median household in North Carolina $1,700 and have already caused businesses in the state to lose $1.5 billion, according to a new “Trump Tax” database assembled by Democrats.
According to a new Democratic Party website launched Wednesday morning called TrumpTax.com, the Trump administration is set to raise the federal deficit by $3.3 trillion and impose greater financial difficulties on all but America’s wealthiest households. “If you’re not a billionaire, the Trump Tax will screw you over,” a DNC press release reads.
“Donald Trump promised to lower costs on Day One, but six months into his disastrous second term, he’s robbing working North Carolinians to fund tax handouts for his billionaire backers,” said DNC Chair Ken Martin. “That’s why the DNC launched TrumpTax.com — to show Americans the dire effects of Trump’s policies in North Carolina. Make no mistake: Trump is a lying fraud who doesn’t give a damn about our children, grandparents, or our North Carolina communities.”
The dashboard combines data from a variety of sources — including Democrats’ Joint Economic Committee, the progressive Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, and Trade Partnership Worldwide — to determine the overall cost to each state of the Trump administration’s trade and tax policies. Nationwide, the website finds that Trump’s tariff policies have cost businesses $56 billion so far this year.
Much of the website focuses on impacts from the controversial Republican-led mega-bill enacted on July 4, projecting that nearly 652,000 North Carolinians are set to lose health insurance and 142,000 may lose flood insurance under its provisions. It also cites research showing that Medicaid, SNAP, and environmental tax credit cuts could cost North Carolina 125,000 jobs.
At the national level, the database shows that cuts to Medicaid, SNAP, and energy subsidies will cut the U.S. GDP by $1.1 trillion, putting more than 5 million jobs at risk. And it projects that farmers will lose $35 billion due to SNAP reductions.
Finally, the website reports that North Carolinians’ electric bills are projected to rise by 18.1% on average due to tax credits eliminated by the bill, and that cuts to Medicaid will likely lead to the closure of five rural hospitals in North Carolina.
Martin warned that the mega-bill — which he called “quite despicable” in an interview with NC Newsline last month — represents “the largest cut to health care in North Carolina history,” as cuts to federal matching funds are expected to trigger the rollback of Medicaid expansion in the state, which a state dashboard shows has allowed nearly 670,000 North Carolinians to receive health coverage.
These impacts were among those that led Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) to rebuke Trump by voting against the bill, ultimately giving up his Senate seat to do so, as he announced his retirement just a day later.
“I did my homework on behalf of North Carolinians, and I cannot support this bill in its current form. It would result in tens of billions of dollars in lost funding for North Carolina, including our hospitals and rural communities,” Tillis wrote in a June 28 statement. “This will force the state to make painful decisions like eliminating Medicaid coverage for hundreds of thousands in the expansion population, and even reducing critical services for those in the traditional Medicaid population.”
Polling suggests that North Carolinians largely disapprove of the bill, in line with Democratic messaging on its consequences. A June survey conducted by left-leaning firm Data for Progress found that 57% of likely voters in the state said they wanted Tillis and Sen. Ted Budd (R-NC) to vote against the bill. The challenge for the DNC is to convert that disapproval into support for their candidates ahead of the 2026 midterms, when they’re set to fight for control of Congress.
North Carolina political consultant Andrew Bates, who served as deputy press secretary under the Biden administration, assisted with developing the project. He condemned Trump for failing to deliver promised economic relief to Americans.
“The biggest tax increase on working Americans since the Great Depression is crushing everyday families to fund tax giveaways to the rich — including whoever is named in the Epstein files,” Bates said.
“This law will affect all of us,” the DNC press release reads. “Hospital closures and Medicaid cuts will lead to higher health care costs and hospital bills for everyone. The Trump Tax will explode the deficit by $3.3 trillion — leading to higher inflation, higher energy bills, and higher grocery and prescription drug costs for everybody.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/trump2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-16 06:03:23.238375

Tom Lawless, chairman of the Registry of Election Finance, questioned the proposal in last week’s board meeting and told the Lookout the offer isn’t high enough. [[...]","A political action committee ran ads attacking Rep. Michelle Reneau, a Chattanooga Republican, in her 2024 race against former Rep. Patsy Hazlewood, also a Republican. (Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)Tennessee’s campaign finance watchdog is balking at a political action committee’s offer to pay a $2,500 settlement in connection with illicit attack ads against a 2024 Republican House candidate.
Tom Lawless, chairman of the Registry of Election Finance, questioned the proposal in last week’s board meeting and told the Lookout the offer isn’t high enough. He added that political professionals know the state’s rules for running campaigns yet try to skirt them and then get away with paying a small penalty.
Attorneys for Civic Engagement Forum and its officer, Thomas Datwyler, admitted in a letter to the Registry of Election Finance that the group constituted a political campaign committee for activity from July through August last year and should have registered and filed expenditure reports with the state.
To settle the matter and avoid further costs and uncertainty, attorney Edward Greim of Kansas City, Missouri, proposed a $2,500 payment. 
In its July meeting, though, the board opted against accepting the settlement and decided to delve further into claims by Republican Rep. Michele Reneau that Datwyler, a political operative connected to several Tennessee officials, illegally ran attack ads against her.
Reneau, of Signal Mountain, filed the complaint with the Registry last year after narrowly defeating veteran Republican Rep. Patsy Hazlewood in the August primary. The filing claims groups identified as Civic Engagement Forum and Citizen Engagement Forum, both linked to Wisconsin-based Datwyler, ran a website dedicated to defeating Reneau and sent out text messages critical of her without registering in Tennessee as a political action committee or disclosing expenses. The Tennessee Journal reported on the matter initially.

“They admitted that they should have filed, which is a real, big problem,” Lawless told the Lookout this week.
Civic Engagement Forum ran Facebook posts saying Reneau was “Too dangerous for TN” and pictured her wearing a tin-foil hat and tying her to an organization called the Weston Price Foundation and saying the head coverings protect people from radiation and COVID-19. The group advocates for raw milk and a ban on childhood vaccinations and soy products.
Reneau reportedly told the Registry board last week she spent three days during the 2024 campaign telling voters the mailers were false. She estimated Facebook ads, text messaging and roughly 3,500 print mailers cost nearly $7,000. If a group’s expenditures exceed $1,000, it must register with the state. 
Datwyler also works for U.S. Rep. Andy Ogles of Culleoka and U.S. Rep. Diana Harshbarger of East Tennessee and was the focus of a collusion complaint filed last year by Sen. Ken Yager of Kingston against first-year Sen. Bobby Harshbarger when he defeated incumbent Sen. Jon Lundberg of Bristol. Datwyler ran the East Tennessee Conservatives, a dark-money group that spent more than a half-million dollars to defeat Lundberg, while also serving as treasurer for U.S. Rep. Harshbarger, the mother of state Sen. Harshbarger.
The Registry dismissed the matter this spring at Yager’s request, even though Lawless and other members wanted to subpoena Datwyler last fall to question him about his role in the Harshbarger-Lundberg campaign.
The Reneau complaint could have taken the same turn, but the Registry turned the case over to the Attorney General’s office, which subpoenaed and interviewed Datwyler, the treasurer of Civic Engagement Forum.
Datwyler denied personal knowledge of Citizen Engagement Forum, Reneau’s candidacy or the group’s actions as a political action committee, according to a report by the Attorney General’s office.
He also said he knew nothing about Citizen Engagement Forum’s distribution of print materials opposing Reneau but sent the AG’s office four documents created by the group in response to an information request. He told investigators he didn’t look at the documents and had no idea why Civic Engagement Forum sent him documents belonging to Citizen Engagement Forum, saying only that it was possible the groups collaborated on materials opposing Reneau’s candidacy.
He declined to provide contact information about three board members for Civic Engagement Forum, telling investigators the organization had no physical location.
The Attorney General’s office determined Citizen Engagement and Civic Engagement are connected because they use the same content and graphics and cite the same articles about Weston Price. Investigators also found that even though Datwyler claimed no connection to Citizen Engagement Forum or knowledge of its campaign activity opposing Reneau, he confirmed he had campaign materials nearly identical to those sent out by Citizen Engagement Forum and received them from “the client,” Civic Engagement Forum.
The Registry board might not have latched on to the matter if former member Tom Morton of East Tennessee hadn’t noted that Reneau’s complaint detailed mailers and other documents with the same Wisconsin address as those used by Datwyler and the East Tennessee Conservatives PAC, the Tennessee Journal reported.

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota attorneys and judicial officials say a lack of funding for a key federal program could harm federal defendants’ ability to get quality representation.
The U.S. Constitution protects criminal defendants’ right to an attorney. When federal defendants can’t afford a lawyer, they are typically assigned a federal public defender. About 40% of the time, however, federal defenders must pass the case to a private lawyer due to a conflict of interest, according to the judicial branch.
But the federal judiciary says that as of July 3, it has no more money to pay outside attorneys for these services. The judicial branch has asked Congress for roughly $116 million to sustain the program until the fiscal year turns over on Oct. 1.
The federal courts draw from panels of approved private defense attorneys when federal public defenders cannot take a case. North Dakota’s pool of private attorneys usually averages around 100 people, said Jason Tupman, the federal public defender for North Dakota and South Dakota. 
However, membership with the panels is voluntary, and about 10 attorneys have resigned from North Dakota’s since the judicial branch learned of the impending budget shortfall this spring, he said.
“The vast majority of our panel are either very small lawyers and oftentimes solo practitioners,” Tupman said. “Anytime you’re saying, ‘Hey, you’re not going to get a paycheck for three months for money we owe you,’ that’s going to have an impact on them.”
The U.S. District Court for North Dakota as of Tuesday had $110,000 in pending payments to panel lawyers, according to Clerk of Court Kari Knudson. The lack of federal funding also means that any expert witnesses or court reporters the attorneys hire also won’t get paid, she said.

Some of the defense attorneys who have withdrawn are among the most experienced in the state, said Mark Friese, who serves as the liaison between North Dakota’s panel and the federal judiciary.
“Some of them that have elected not to renew are really, really good lawyers,” he said.
Tupman and Friese last week sent a letter to North Dakota’s congressional delegation calling attention to the budget gap.
“Without reliable funding, attorneys will continue to withdraw, decline appointments or delay critical work,” they said in the letter. “Trials will be postponed, and the effectiveness of our federal courts will be significantly compromised.”
Friese, who has served on North Dakota’s panel for nearly 25 years, said he’s seen payments to attorneys deferred in the past due to budget issues but never for several months.
“I haven’t seen one like this where we have to go out and tell our panel lawyers they can’t be paid and they won’t be until sometime after October,” he said.
Tupman said some attorneys who are still serving on the panel appear less willing than usual to accept new appointments. He said he suspects this could be due to the funding gap, though it’s hard to know for sure.
He said panel attorneys in South Dakota are tracked differently, so he’s not aware of whether it is also seeing membership diminish.
Some defense attorneys are continuing to accept appointments without pay.
“The lawyers that do this just do this out of a sense of commitment,” Friese said. “With criminal cases in North Dakota, the economic reality is these lawyers can make more money by doing things on their own or with their firm than by taking these cases.”
About 90% of federal criminal defendants can’t afford to hire an attorney, according to the federal court system.
North Dakota public defenders see budget increase with new biennium

Generally, the judicial branch pays all panel attorneys $175 per hour. This is lower than the market rate, said Friese.
Spokespeople for Rep. Julie Fedorchak and Sen. John Hoeven, both Republicans, told the North Dakota Monitor they are looking at the issue.
North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong, a former defense attorney, said he plans to speak to members of Congress about the situation when he’s in D.C. this week for a congressional hearing.
“It’s a real problem,” he said in a statement to the North Dakota Monitor.
Since October of last year, the U.S. District Court for North Dakota has paid outside attorneys more than $2.7 million to represent defendants, Knudson said. 
Chief Judge Peter Welte said that the funding gap has yet to have a noticeable impact on his court.
“The court is continuing to function well, and on a day-to-day operations standpoint, I don’t feel like we’ve been suffering yet,” he said.
Still, Welte said the deficit worries him. He said he anticipates money will remain a problem for federal courts in the upcoming fiscal year. 
“The federal budgeting process has been a constant issue since I took the bench,” he said. 
The current funding gap comes as the district court is on track to outpace last year’s caseload in all categories, he added.
North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Dan Traynor said he also isn’t aware of any immediate impacts to his court, but was critical of the shortfall.  
“This is no way to run a railroad much less the U.S. government,” he said in a statement to the Monitor.
Federal defenders offices nationwide have been under a hiring freeze for almost two years. As a result, the Federal Defenders Office for North Dakota and South Dakota is staffed at 80-90% capacity, Tupman said. His office has 51 employees. 
“It makes for higher case loads and more stress,” he said.

Kennedy Jr. testifies before a Senate Appropriations subcommittee on Tuesday, May 20, 2025. (Screenshot from committee webcast)On his way to an Ultimate Fighting Championship event, Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. stopped by the home of podcaster Gary Brecka. The two spent time in a hyperbaric oxygen chamber and tried some intravenous nutrition drips that Brecka, a self-avowed longevity and wellness maven, sells and promotes on his show, “The Ultimate Human.”
Then the podcast taping started, and Kennedy — who was also on the mic — took aim at Big Pharma’s influence on federal health policy.
“We have a sick-care system in our country, and the etiology ultimately of all that disease is corruption,” Kennedy said before the show cut away to an ad for vitamin chips. “And it’s the capture of these agencies by the industries they are supposed to regulate.”
While Kennedy lambastes federal agencies he says are overly influenced by the pharmaceutical industry, he and some other figures of the “Make America Healthy Again,” or MAHA, movement — such as siblings Calley and Casey Means, Robert Malone, and Peter McCullough — have their own financial ties to a vast and largely unregulated $6.3 trillion global wellness industry they also support and promote.
Kennedy and those four advisers — three of whom have been tapped for official government roles — earned at least $3.2 million in fees and salaries from their work opposing Big Pharma and promoting wellness in 2022 and 2023, according to a KFF Health News review of financial disclosure forms filed with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Department of Health and Human Services; published media reports; and tax forms filed with the IRS.
The total doesn’t include revenue from speaking fees, the sale of wellness products, or other income sources for which data isn’t publicly available.
The Means siblings have launched wellness companies that have raised more than $99 million from investors, according to company news releases as well as information from Clay, a customer research data company, and Tracxn, an information technology firm that provides access to a database of companies, funding rounds, and investor information.
“Secretary Kennedy, and all HHS officials, fully comply with all ethics and financial disclosure laws,” agency spokesperson Emily Hilliard said in an email. “Any attempt to suggest impropriety is reckless and politically motivated.”
Some public health leaders and ethicists say the financial ties raise red flags, with the potential for personal profits to shape decision-making at the highest levels of federal health agencies.
“It’s becoming completely corrupted,” said Arthur Caplan, founding head of the medical ethics division at New York University’s Grossman School of Medicine. “You shouldn’t have a vested interest in making recommendations on wellness or supplements or health. It opens the door to all kinds of shenanigans. Big Wellness is no different than Big Pharma. They’re a well-organized political force.”
Unlike any other previous administration, President Donald Trump’s administration has elevated anti-vaccine and wellness leaders to positions at HHS from which they can steer federal policy. Adherents to the MAHA movement say the change is long overdue, arguing that previous administrations haven’t devoted sufficient attention to the potential harms of traditional medical approaches.
Critics including health policy leaders and physicians say they worry the revamped HHS and its agencies are now harming public health. For example, they point to a recent Kennedy decision to remove and replace all the members of a vaccine advisory group, a move the American Medical Association criticized as lacking transparency and proper vetting. Two of Kennedy’s newly named panel members — Malone and Martin Kulldorff — previously earned money as paid experts in vaccine lawsuits against Merck, as first reported by Reuters and the life-sciences news outlet BioSpace.
Calley Means, who has criticized the recommended U.S. vaccine schedule for youths and has no medical training, is a special government employee and a top health adviser to Kennedy. He also co-founded the wellness company Truemed.
The company enables people to spend pretax dollars from Flexible Spending Accounts and Health Savings Accounts to pay for wellness products, health food, and SoulCycle classes.
Truemed’s website says it can provide customers with a “Letter of Medical Necessity” for the items.
The IRS has warned consumers about companies that misrepresent wellness items like food as FSA-eligible when they are not, in fact, permitted medical expenses.
The IRS did not respond to questions about the status of that policy under the Trump administration.
In 2024, when Kennedy was running for president as an independent, he promoted Means’ company on his own podcast. Means also promoted his close connection with Kennedy last year on podcasts and on Instagram while also using social media to advance Truemed. And while working for the public as a special government employee since March, Means has used social and new media to promote podcasters who make money selling wellness products, to criticize specific pharmaceutical drugs, and to tout the wellness book he co-wrote, “Good Energy,” according to a KFF Health News review of social media posts and podcasts.
Means has also used podcasts and social media to rail against new injectable weight loss drugs. The Trump administration in April decided not to finalize a rule that would have allowed Medicaid and Medicare to cover the injectable drugs, putting them out of reach for millions of potential users.
Hilliard, the HHS spokesperson, didn’t respond to questions about whether Means, as a Kennedy adviser, has recused himself from decisions that could affect his business. Neither HHS nor the White House responded to requests to speak with him.
His sister, Casey Means, is Trump’s pick for surgeon general and was also an adviser to Kennedy during his 2024 presidential run. She co-founded Levels, a company valued at $300 million in 2022 that promotes glucose monitoring for nondiabetic, healthy individuals. Consumers pay $199 for a one-month supply of continuous glucose monitors.
She has used social media to call for public policy that would encourage blood sugar monitoring for healthy individuals, saying “tips to stabilize glucose should be on every billboard in America.” Research has found little evidence that such monitoring provides health benefits for people without diabetes.
Her company stands to benefit under the Trump administration. Kennedy said in April that he was considering a regulatory framework for federal health programs’ coverage of injectable weight loss drugs that would first require patients to try glucose monitoring or other options.
“And if they don’t work, then you would be entitled to the drug,” he told CBS News.
Casey Means isn’t a practicing doctor and doesn’t hold an active medical license, according to records from the Oregon Medical Board. And, as an online influencer, she “failed to disclose that she could profit” from sales of products she recommends, according to The Associated Press.
HHS spokesperson Hilliard didn’t answer questions about whether Casey Means would recuse herself from working on anything that would directly benefit her company, or why she didn’t disclose that she could profit from sales of products she recommends. HHS didn’t respond to questions about Means’ ties to Kennedy or agency support for glucose monitoring, nor did the agency respond to a request to speak directly to the Trump surgeon general pick.
Outside Advisers
McCullough, a former cardiac doctor who has financial ties to the wellness industry, has been part of Kennedy’s circle of informal advisers, according to people close to the secretary. He also has enough sway with some GOP lawmakers that they’ve had him testify before Congress. In May, he told a Senate subcommittee that mRNA covid-19 vaccines can lead to deaths that have been underreported. But the FDA says the covid vaccines are safe, with fewer than 1 in 200,000 vaccinated individuals experiencing a severe allergic reaction or heart problems like myocarditis or pericarditis.
He profits from his anti-covid-vaccine message. McCullough devised a protocol he says helps people detox from covid mRNA shots, selling the products through The Wellness Co. McCullough is the company’s chief scientific officer, draws a partial salary, and holds an equity stake.
For $89.99, consumers can purchase Ultimate Spike Detox supplements containing nattokinase, an enzyme from fermented soybeans. A two-month supply of Spike Support supplements sells on Amazon for about $62. More than 900 bottles have sold in the past month.
McCullough didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. HHS also didn’t respond to questions about his relationship with Kennedy.
Some health policy leaders and doctors say the financial connections federal health officials and advisers have to the wellness industry raise concerns.
“It’s exactly the problem RFK has taken up with the FDA, saying it’s too beholden to pharma,” said Pieter Cohen, an associate professor of medicine at Harvard University.
“When you’re in bed with supplement manufacturers, you are creating the same kinds of conflicts of interest, whether or not you directly profit,” he said. “You should be independently advocating for public health, not cheerleading for any particular industry.”
The wellness sector includes personal care, weight loss, health, nutrition, and wellness tourism.
Its lobbying influence is markedly smaller than the lobbying reach of pharmaceutical companies, according to OpenSecrets, a research organization that tracks money in U.S. politics. The nutritional and dietary supplements industry spent about $3.7 million on lobbying in 2024, for example, compared with the $387 million the pharmaceutical industry spent the same year.
It’s also gotten far less scrutiny. The industry is a growing political force with its own lobbyists, celebrities, and industry-backed advocacy groups, and research shows that public interest in wellness has grown since the pandemic. Eighty-four percent of U.S. consumers say wellness is a “top” or “important” priority, according to a survey released this year by McKinsey & Co.
Unlike with Big Pharma, there’s scant regulation of the industry. Companies can sell supplements and other products without notifying the FDA, and there’s little oversight by the Federal Trade Commission of their product claims.
“The wellness industry profiteers by undermining and creating distrust in science and regulated products,” said Andrea Love, an immunologist and microbiologist who founded ImmunoLogic, a science and health education organization. “They are messaging that the government and Big Pharma are hiding information and treatments or cures to keep us weak and vulnerable.”
Ethics and Disclosures
People on both sides of the issue say the industry has found its captain in Kennedy, an anti-vaccine activist with deep ties to the MAHA and wellness movements.
He has profited by referring people to law firms that are suing over alleged vaccine injury. For example, he gets a fee for referring potential clients to a Los Angeles personal injury firm, according to a January ethics statement to HHS and his financial disclosures. One of his adult sons works at the personal injury law firm.
When his nomination to the HHS secretary post was under consideration, Kennedy indicated in his ethics disclosure that he intended to continue profiting from lawsuits over Gardasil, a Merck vaccine that protects against HPV. After Democrats raised concerns with the financial relationship, he told Congress he would divest his interest and sign over the financial stake to one of his adult sons.
Federal ethics rules bar government employees from participating in matters in which they, their spouse, or their minor child has a financial stake. It doesn’t include adult children such as Kennedy’s sons.
“There are a lot of loopholes, and that is one of them,” said Cynthia Brown, senior ethics counsel at the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a watchdog organization focused on U.S. government ethics and accountability. “It certainly is an appearance problem. Even if it’s not a technical violation, it is an ethical problem in terms of influence.”
Some lawmakers and ethics leaders weren’t mollified by Kennedy’s planned divestiture. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) called on Kennedy to agree to a four-year, post-employment ban on accepting any compensation from lawsuits involving any entity regulated by HHS.
“It would be insufficient for RFK Jr. to only divest his interest in the Gardasil case while leaving the window open to profit from other anti-vax lawsuits, including future cases he could bring after leaving office,” she said in a statement.
Kennedy also made money on the MAHA name by applying in September to register it as a trademark. He transferred trademark ownership to a limited liability company led by friend and MAHA ally Del Bigtree after making about $100,000 off the phrase, according to his financial disclosure.
HHS’ Hilliard didn’t answer questions about whether Kennedy had signed over his interest in fees from legal referrals to his son, the money he made by registering MAHA as a trademark, or whether he agreed with Warren’s request that upon leaving office he accept a four-year ban on accepting money from lawsuits involving entities regulated by HHS.
Bigtree is executive director of the Informed Consent Action Network, or ICAN, an anti-vaccination group. He was communications director for Kennedy’s failed presidential campaign, and as an informal adviser to the secretary he helped vet candidates for HHS jobs. Bigtree’s salary at the nonprofit was $234,000 for the 2023 fiscal year, according to documents filed with the IRS. ICAN paid $6 million in legal fees to Siri & Glimstad in 2023. The firm’s managing partner, Aaron Siri, focuses on vaccine injury. He has been Kennedy’s personal lawyer and adviser, and also helped vet candidates for the secretary.
Brown, an ethics counselor, said the transfer and ongoing advisory relationship could raise questions about who is influencing Kennedy. Bigtree, at a Politico event in February, called on Kennedy to recruit scientists to HHS who believe vaccines cause autism, for example. One of Kennedy’s early actions at HHS was the launch of a study on the causes of autism.
ICAN didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. HHS also didn’t respond to questions about Kennedy’s transfer of the MAHA trademark to Bigtree.
“This is the type of Washington wheeling and dealing that raises questions about integrity in government,” Brown said. “If it was trademarked before he became a public official, there may be no law broken. But by transferring it to someone he knows, it illustrates the constant trickle of influence among those in power.”
Past administrations have faced similar criticism over health regulators’ ties to Big Pharma. Alex Azar, who led HHS during the previous Trump administration, worked for drugmaker Eli Lilly before entering public office. Robert Califf, FDA commissioner during the Biden administration, was a consultant to drug companies.
Scott Gottlieb, who was FDA commissioner from 2017 to 2019 and an adviser to Trump’s presidential campaign, stepped down to join the board of the drugmaker Pfizer.
“Big Pharma is well off. But, in general, financial conflicts don’t depend on how much the organizations are spending,” said Zeke Emanuel, a bioethicist who served on a covid advisory board under President Joe Biden. “The question is, is there a reasonable concern that financial or other concerns are affecting their judgment?”

Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West — including Colorado — and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.

The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Eric Vryn | Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.











There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has.


– Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations



Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

(Tyler Martin/NASA).NEW ORLEANS – Nearly all of the employees of a NASA contractor at the Michoud Assembly Facility and Stennis Space Center that faced layoffs at the end of June have been hired by the company that’s been awarded a similar contract.
Syncom Spaces Services, a Fort Worth, Texas-based joint venture, gave official notice to state labor officials in May that it would lay off 296 employees once its contract with NASA expired at the end of June. Several positions were impacted, including construction personnel, electricians, maintenance workers and engineers in multiple disciplines. 
Nova Space Solutions was awarded an $823 million NASA contract last year to provide many of the same services as Syncom, and it has absorbed nearly all of the Michoud and Stennis staff that had worked for Syncom.   
CJ Loria, Nova’s president and general manager, said in a statement to the Illuminator that its contract does not cover some of the functions at Stennis that were split off into separate contracts. They include security services, the Stennis Fire Department and rocket testing, 
“We hired roughly 95% of the incumbent … workforce that were not on the other three previously mentioned contracts,” Loria said.
Nova now employs 518 people at the two sites, with 260 of those at Michoud and 258 at Stennis. 
Nova Space Solutions is a joint venture between Chugach Government Solutions of Anchorage, Alaska, and Amentum, a major government contractor based in Virginia. Amentum was also a partner in the Syncom contract, having partnered with BWXT, a multi-industry government services provider also based in Virginia.

This story was originally published by The Institute for Public Service Reporting Memphis.
Healthcare providers across Tennessee are scrambling to find new funding for HIV prevention following the loss of a critical federal grant.
Tennessee lost the funding earlier this spring amid deep spending cuts at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
United Way of Greater Nashville, the organization that directs federal HIV funding to nonprofits and healthcare agencies across the state, told the Institute for Public Service Reporting its CDC agreement “expired” on the last day of May. That funding, totaling $4 million, represents roughly half of all federal dollars spent in Tennessee for HIV prevention and treatment.
The cuts are expected to hit especially hard in Memphis, where HIV infection rates are among the highest in the country.
“This moment calls for creativity in how we fund HIV prevention and care at the local level especially in states that do not have a political appetite for action,” said Adrian Shanker, a senior official for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services during the Biden administration.
The Ryan White program, the federal program that covers HIV treatment and treatment-related needs for people who couldn’t otherwise afford them, appears to be left intact.
But the cuts are expected to decrease the accessibility of birth control supplies and trigger layoffs of social workers and employees who help people navigate access to PrEP, or pre-exposure prophylaxis, a key drug for at-risk individuals that greatly reduces the odds of contracting HIV.










This is scary to me, you know? It just means that categories of people who were already underserved are going to be in a worse situation than they were before,


– Rob Bobal, A Betor Way


The loss of the federal funding comes as Memphis health officials face rising rates of new infections of HIV and syphilis and an uncertain future of disease surveillance at the state and national level.
Data shows a steady climb since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 when the Shelby County Health Department logged 238 new HIV infections. In 2023, the latest year data is available from both the county and state health departments, that number jumped to 353. This total does not include individuals who may have unknowingly contracted the virus.
Rob Bobal, founder of the Memphis nonprofit A Betor Way, which faces a loss of $125,000 a year in funding, said the cuts in prevention funding have implications beyond the spread of HIV. Bobal’s nonprofit specializes in harm reduction, providing clean needles and rapid HIV testing for intravenous drug users who may otherwise reuse needles and spread infections.
Add to that, Bobal said, the funding cuts often translate to a loss of jobs and an overall weakening of an already under-funded infrastructure of community-based organizations.
“This is scary to me, you know? It just means that categories of people who were already underserved are going to be in a worse situation than they were before,” Bobal said. “You take all the CBOs (community-based organizations) out of Memphis … I don’t know what’s left.”
Great uncertainty
Tennessee healthcare providers had an oral commitment from the CDC under the Biden administration to continue the HIV prevention funding for another year but discussions abruptly stopped after President Donald Trump took office in January, according to people familiar with the matter who asked to remain anonymous to discuss sensitive information. CDC later initiated procedures to close-out and discontinue the grant, these people said.
As funding sources for sexual and reproductive health continue to dry up, upheaval at the federal level adds another layer of complication for HIV surveillance, prevention and treatment.
Since President Trump took office in January, HHS has discontinued research into a promising vaccine for HIV, just months before trials were to start. The federal entity, which houses the CDC, also is hurriedly rehiring hundreds of workers fired earlier this spring under the direction of the Department of Government Efficiency or DOGE, which was overseen for a time by billionaire Elon Musk.
The disruptions are “not insignificant,” Shanker said.
“There was a light at the end of the tunnel, so to speak,” he said. “These are setbacks that that will require massive investments from non-governmental sources, just to stay close to being on track to where we were before. And that’s really, really challenging.”

The challenges will trickle down.
In Shelby County, when a person receives a positive result on an HIV test, regardless of where they are tested, they are told to contact anyone they have had intercourse with within the past year. Positive test results are also reported to the health department, where staff contact tracers work to contact any at-risk individuals associated with the positive test.
The positive test result then goes on a journey. If a person is tested at a community organization or a healthcare office, results are reported to the county health department. From there, the numbers are sent to the state health department, where the data is compiled.
Often preliminary data — data that is still being analyzed and verified — is the closest the public can get to the most recent information about how HIV is spreading. The latest data available from both the state and county stops in 2023.
Information gathered locally about new HIV infections is collected by the CDC’s National HIV Surveillance System. However, that system was disrupted this spring when numbers of employees were fired as part of a DOGE-driven restructuring. In all, some 10,000 HHS employees were laid off in March. A federal judge in Rhode Island ruled earlier this month that the layoffs were likely unlawful; It’s unclear how that decision may affect the surveillance program.
The court ruling aside, the federal government already is rehiring hundreds of previously fired workers, HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. told a U.S. House of Representatives subcommittee on June 24.
Even if every fired CDC employee that coordinated federal efforts to contain and eliminate HIV is hired back, the disruption, as Shanker said, is a significant setback.
Setbacks hit hard in Memphis
For cities like Memphis, a national leader in new infection rates, setbacks at the federal level hit especially hard.
HIV infection rates prompted Shelby County Health Director Michelle Taylor to sound the alarm over the past year. In February, she met with local hospital leaders and urged the implementation of “opt out” testing for HIV for patients treated in emergency rooms, meaning patients would be universally screened for HIV unless they declined the test.
Regional One Health, a public hospital that treats historically vulnerable communities, has flagged HIV infections as a priority for years. All patients who are admitted to the hospital are screened for HIV, Angie Golding, the communications director, told The Institute.
Meanwhile, other healthcare providers are bracing for the cuts.

CHOICES-Memphis Center for Reproductive Health, an organization that once provided abortions and still provides midwifery services, has endured both Title X cuts and CDC cuts.
CHOICES CEO Jennifer Pepper said her organization’s ability to provide subsidized sexual and reproductive healthcare is in jeopardy. Clincs that provide similar services are also feeling the squeeze.
For Pepper, the stripped funding is a familiar scenario. She observed multiple efforts, many successful, to cleave funding sources from organizations that provided abortions in the years before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade.
Now, she’s watching colleagues that provide sexual and reproductive health services go through their first rounds of targeted defunding.
“I feel like those who have provided abortion care are, unfortunately, particularly prepared for this moment. But this is a new experience, in some ways, for HIV treatment providers and community-based healthcare providers,” Pepper said.
“Unfortunately, other providers are now experiencing the same thing.”

(Douglas Sacha | Getty Images)Last year’s education cuts at West Virginia University by then university president, Gordon Gee, rattled the Mountain State. Gee was like a bull in a china shop. Gone were majors in civil engineering. Education administration. Art history. Graduate math. Our venerated Appalachian studies department. World Language program (despite having 1,000 international students.) Twenty-eight majors were axed. And 143 faculty positions! Over 17%. Sayonara, tenured professors. These were not luxury programs. They were essential to our flagship university. 
Now, Gov. Patrick Morrisey is wading into the fray, along with House Delegate Majority leader, Pat McGeehan (who teaches history and civics at Madonna High School, a private Catholic school in Weirton). They are championing a “Center for Civics, Culture and Statesmanship.” There was a photo of them announcing the center. A big cross was hanging on the all behind them. This violates the separation of church and state. 
They secured public funding to do it. From where? How much is the annual budget? How big will the staff be? Since it is public funds, where is the money going? What is the curriculum being taught? (Afterall, this is demanded of public school teachers paid with public funds.) 
It’s a slap in the face to West Virginia University. There is no effort to resuscitate healthy, robust and popular programs. Just a push for a new center. 
The right is losing their collective minds. They can’t stand to know history actually involves anyone who is not a white male. But civics education doesn’t just celebrate the founding fathers — it examines who was excluded and how people have fought to change that. 
As a refresher: The 13th Amendment abolished slavery.The 14th guaranteed equal protection under the law. The 15th gave Black men the right to vote (at least on paper). The 19th gave women the right to vote. The 26th lowered the voting age to 18, because students demanded a voice during the Vietnam War. Each and every one of these made the Constitution more aligned with our true American values. 
Changes happened because people were loud. Marched. Hollered. Voted. Protested. Showed up. They believed in democracy. Believed in freedom. Change. Even when Black Americans were treated as second class citizens at home, they served with pride in the military throughout history. They fought and died to create a better America. Not one that exists–one that should be. 
The center is a great idea. But don’t forget the amendments. If it does it will be indoctrination to the nth degree. You cannot teach “culture” while erasing Appalachian culture. You cannot teach “statesmanship” while eliminating languages through which diplomacy and democracy occur. You cannot teach the Constitution while ignoring that for most of our nation’s history, women, Black Americans, and working-class people were systematically excluded. 
When public officials talk about “restoring civics” it’s a code phrase. Not for questioning power and finding truth. It seems to want to drag us back to an era where dissent was seen as disloyalty. 
Is this a constitutional literacy project? Perhaps. Certainly a political vanity project. By appointing his own head of the program, the governor can be an ideological gatekeeper. 
Here in West Virginia we believe in “montani semper liberi:” Mountaineers are always free. And until all our brothers and sisters are free in the Mountain State? None of us are. We rise and fall as one community. 
Remember this: The Constitution belongs to all. Rich, poor. Black, white. The Constitution is a living, breathing, document. We were not in the room when it was created, but we are in the room now. We must defend each and every amendment. And guide the next chapter.

And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Dozens of members of Congress from both parties plead with Trump to unfreeze FEMA grants

Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.

 Trump administration says states should fund response to disasters

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.













There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has.


– Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations





Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Idaho wildfire potential remains high as hot temperatures continue 

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
 National Weather Service, NOAA employees cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Austin Anthony)Whether they’ve told you or not, someone you know or love has probably experienced or is experiencing domestic violence. 
They might be a coworker who is constantly bombarded with calls from their spouse, a sibling who suddenly can no longer make it to family gatherings, or your child’s best friend who wants to spend every weekend at your house. 
Everyone knows someone affected by domestic violence. Kentucky’s 15 state-designated domestic violence programs provided more than 15,500 Kentuckians with domestic violence services in fiscal year 2024 alone. 
 Unfortunately, the services you or a survivor of domestic violence might turn to for help in the face of abuse are under threat of destabilization due to ongoing federal funding uncertainty. Federal grant cancellations, delays to the release of funding opportunities, firings at federal agencies that distribute funding for services, and the president’s proposed cuts to domestic violence and sexual assault programs in his fiscal year 2026 budget proposal have us worried about the future of domestic violence services across the country.    
ZeroV, Kentucky’s domestic violence coalition, and our network of 15 member programs rely on nearly $20.2 million in federal funding to provide lifesaving services to survivors and their children across the state. Federal funding makes up more than 40% of our combined budgets, and it supports every service our network provides, including crisis lines, emergency shelter, safety planning, court advocacy, housing assistance, food assistance and more.  
Congress will soon start making budget appropriations for FY26, and it is imperative that members consider the lives they would risk by cutting funding for domestic violence services. 
As certainty about federal funding continues to diminish, questions about the future of domestic violence services continue to grow: What parts of the services infrastructure that generations of victim-survivor advocates have worked hard to build over the last 40 years might disappear? Which of our lifesaving services might be reduced or entirely lost? But most importantly, what would happen to our friends, family members, coworkers, and neighbors experiencing domestic violence if the services that could save their lives were no longer accessible or available?   
When lives are on the line, we cannot afford to be uncertain. Our commonwealth must be willing to take a stand for its most vulnerable Kentuckians, including those experiencing multiple layers of barriers and oppression that intersect with and add to the trauma of domestic violence.
 If we are to end domestic violence, we must address the racism, homophobia, poverty, homelessness, mental health issues and substance misuse issues that make survivors more vulnerable to abuse; we must hold accountable the people who abuse their partners; and we must find a way to increase protective factors such as accessible and affordable food, housing and health care. Cutting federal funding and infrastructure is not the answer. We must protect the lives and futures of survivors and our communities by protecting the domestic violence services our fellow Kentuckians depend on.  
ZeroV has launched a #GetLoudForSurvivors campaign to raise awareness about threats to victim-survivor services.

(Courtesy of Lionel Randolph)I’ve been a bus driver for 21 years, and a public transit rider my whole life. For me and my fellow union members, public transit isn’t optional. It’s how we get to work, pick up groceries, and visit our loved ones.
It’s there on ordinary days and on some of the best ones, too — like next year, when Pennsylvanians will head to Pittsburgh for the NFL draft and to Philly for the World Cup. Personally, I don’t like driving in big cities. Transit is the reliable, affordable alternative that keeps traffic down and connects us all.
That is, if it’s still there when we need it.
SEPTA recently adopted a budget that will slash nearly half its transit service — proof that this crisis isn’t coming, it’s already here. If lawmakers don’t act, communities big and small will face the same consequences.
After years of underinvestment and short-term fixes, the 53 different public transit systems serving all 67 Pennsylvania counties are reaching a breaking point. Without a fix to funding needs, service cuts will begin as soon as next month — jeopardizing everything from daily commutes to once-in-a-lifetime events.
I’m already seeing the impacts in my community.
On hot summer weekends, there’s no longer a Route 322 bus to take families to Hershey Park. Limiting that route to weekdays also means patients, medical workers, and even people facing medical emergencies can’t reach Penn State Hershey Medical Center by bus. As one of the largest emergency centers in central Pennsylvania, it needs reliable transit access. But cuts have already made care harder to reach.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
More routes will be eliminated.
Fares will rise.
Entire communities will lose access to basic transportation.
Workers will lose jobs they can no longer reach. Students will struggle to get to class. Families will be cut off from health and child care. And more cars will flood our streets, worsening traffic, increasing pollution, and driving up asthma rates in already overburdened communities.
This crisis didn’t come out of nowhere. In 2022, a major source of dedicated transit funding expired. Since then, agencies have stretched every dollar and patched together temporary fixes. But that approach has run out of road. Lasting funding is needed or transit systems will continue dismantling themselves—one route, fare hike, and layoff at a time.
Let’s be clear: Public transit is not a luxury.
It’s essential infrastructure. And its benefits are not equally distributed, which is exactly why it must be protected and expanded. For many Pennsylvanians, including essential workers, seniors, students, and people with disabilities, it’s the only way to get around.
In Philly, more than one in three households lack car access. In Pittsburgh, nearly 60 percent of riders commute by transit. In smaller towns and rural counties, where a single bus route may be the only connection to a hospital or college campus, transit agencies provide over 45,000 rides every day. When service disappears, it’s not just mobility that’s lost—it’s opportunity.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Investing in transit also means investing in good, family-sustaining jobs. Mechanics, electricians, dispatchers, maintenance workers, and operators like me keep systems running. A robust transit system would support thousands of union jobs with good benefits.
Despite all this, Pennsylvania still hasn’t committed to long-term funding. The governor’s plan is a strong start, but a one-time boost won’t save the system. Agencies need stable, sustained funding. Riders deserve reliable service. Workers deserve job security. And our economy depends on both.
This isn’t a partisan issue.
It’s a public responsibility.
Reliable transit helps workers punch the clock, kids get to school, older adults stay independent, and communities thrive. We can’t treat it like an afterthought.
The good news? Solutions exist. What’s missing isn’t ideas, it’s political will. Read steps toward long-term solutions are needed now.
Because if we let public transit fail, we’re not just stopping buses—we’re closing off entire pathways to opportunity and economic growth.
We cannot afford to fail.

And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
 The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
 Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

(Greg LaRose/Louisiana Illuminator)Donald Trump closed out his 2024 presidential campaign with a searing condemnation of trans rights: “Kamala Harris is for they/them, President Trump is for you.”
Nearly six months into his second term, North Carolina Republicans have heeded his call, delivering blistering speeches on the floor of the General Assembly in support of rigid definitions of biological sex and passing a slew of measures aimed at curtailing trans rights, hoping to capitalize on what they believe is a winning issue among North Carolinians.
It’s a far cry from 2016, when months into Trump’s first successful campaign for the office, the state legislature’s passage of House Bill 2, the “Bathroom Bill,” sent billions of dollars fleeing from the state. As culture wars escalate across the U.S., laws clamping down on trans rights have entered the mainstream, with some Democrats acceding to or even supporting anti-trans bills from the other side of the aisle.
Here’s how North Carolina politicians have handled anti-trans legislation in 2025 — from Republican leadership seeing an opportunity to win on the issue to Democrats, including Governor Josh Stein, relenting in response to at least some of those efforts.
Stein splits the difference on anti-trans bills
In contrast to former Governor Roy Cooper, who emphasized public stands in defense of trans rights after winning office in the wake of the backlash to HB 2, Stein has had little to say on trans issues in seven months in office.
He has also signaled some willingness to allow conservative bills on trans issues to proceed. On July 3, he signed Senate Bill 442, enacting a piece of legislation that bars abuse or neglect findings on the basis of a parent or caregiver who “raises a juvenile consistent with the juvenile’s biological sex.”

That signing garnered rare praise for Stein from the NC Values Coalition, a religious right advocacy group. The group’s executive director, Tami Fitzgerald, lauded the governor for helping parents “protect their children from harmful gender transition interventions.”
“We are thankful that today Governor Stein signed SB 442 into law, ensuring that our state upholds the fundamental truth that children belong to their parents, not the government,” said Fitzgerald. “Now that Governor Stein signed SB 442 into law, North Carolina parents can rest easy knowing that they can exercise their parental rights without fear of the government taking their child away.”
The signing puts Stein out of step with most of his party — in its final vote in each chamber, no Democrats in the Senate backed the bill, and just nine supported it in the House. Unlike some other bills he took action on, Stein did not provide a written explanation for his decision, but a spokesperson wrote in a statement that the bill will not change how North Carolina punishes cases of abuse.
“Parents have the right to raise their kids how they think is best for them, but, of course, child abuse will never be tolerated,” the spokesperson wrote Tuesday. “The Governor remains confident that DHHS and county DSS offices will continue to find the best placements for children.”
North Carolina ACLU policy counsel Reighlah Collins said she was “disappointed but not necessarily surprised” that Stein signed the bill, calling it “bad messaging” but whose impact will be “hopefully, pretty small.”
“The parents in North Carolina are not being criminally charged or losing custody of their children because they refuse to support their child’s gender identity. Like, it’s just not something that’s happening in North Carolina,” Collins said. “It’s all part of this broader strategy to push trans people out of public and civil life by just singling them out in all of these respects.”
Also on July 3, Stein vetoed House Bill 805 — a separate bill that was amended at a late stage to include measures exclusively recognizing male and female sexes under state law, blocking state funds for gender-affirming care, and restricting changes of sex designation on birth certificates — explaining in a statement that Republicans are “stoking culture wars that further divide us.”
  As Governor, Roy Cooper emphasized public stands on trans rights, beginning with his ascension to the office in the wake of backlash to the “Bathroom Bill.” (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
“These mean-spirited bills would marginalize vulnerable people and also undermine the quality of public services and public education. Therefore, I am vetoing them,” Stein said. “I stand ready to work with the legislature when it gets serious about protecting people and addressing North Carolinians’ pressing concerns.”
Beyond alluding to culture wars, the veto statement did not explicitly reference trans North Carolinians or gender-affirming care, a break from Cooper’s approach to these issues. In a 2023 veto on another bill seeking to block access to medical transitions, Cooper said “a doctor’s office is no place for politicians, and North Carolina should continue to let parents and medical professionals make decisions about the best way to offer gender care, for their children.”
A more subdued approach has not spared Stein from condemnation from the right. House Speaker Destin Hall posted on X that Stein “sided with radical activists over the overwhelming majority of North Carolinians” in the wake of his veto. Fitzgerald, the NC Values Coalition executive director, blasted Stein for “appeasing the radical block of his party that wants to force its sexual agenda on all of us” and called him “out of step with the values of the majority of North Carolinians.”
Top Republican lawmakers see opportunity to go on the offensive
If the Governor has spoken little on trans issues, Republicans in the General Assembly have seized every opportunity to drive a wedge in his coalition on anti-LGBTQ+ legislation, explicitly following Trump’s lead in doing so.

“Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill CRUSHES woke insanity,” Hall wrote in a July 14 post on X. “HB 805 does the same by affirming biological truth. Stein vetoed, but the NC House will DELIVER.”
North Carolina Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger, Hall’s counterpart, authored a similar post on July 2, alleging that Democrats like Stein are “actively working against women by refusing to simply acknowledge there are two sexes — male and female.”
Even amid growing discontent with the Trump administration over economic and immigration issues, the Republican emphasis on anti-trans legislation suggests they still view the issue as a political winner. Chris Cooper, a political scientist at Western Carolina University, said Republicans see the potential for political benefit in passing such bills.
“I think there is a sense from the Republican Party that they are closer to the average North Carolinian on these issues than the Democrats are,” Cooper said. “I think they believe that politically, the bathroom-related legislation is a political loser, and that in general, things related to children and minors are political winners.”
Growing anti-trans sentiment can be found in recent polling. An April survey of registered North Carolina voters by Meredith College shows that even on the issue of restricting bathroom use, considered beyond the pale a decade ago, a majority support proposals that roll back trans rights.
Asked about restricting trans North Carolinians to only using public bathrooms corresponding to their assigned sex at birth, 57% of surveyed voters voiced support. And 56% said they would support making it impossible for sex markers to be changed on an individual’s birth certificate, a more restrictive proposal than the one Stein vetoed.
David McLennan, the director of the Meredith Poll, attributed this shift to Trump’s rhetoric. “In less than a decade, the issue of restricting transgender rights has become popular among North Carolinians,” he said in a statement. “This clearly reflects the concerted efforts of national Republicans, including President Trump, to demonize this group.”
Among the most restrictive measures proposed on trans issues this session was Senate Bill 516, in effect a resurrection and expansion of HB 2. The proposal would have barred trans people from single-sex bathrooms, changing facilities, and sleeping quarters at state-funded facilities that correspond to their gender identity.
  North Carolina Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger (R-Rockingham), pictured at Stein’s State of the State address, said he did not see a “runway exists” for the bathrooms and public facilities bill this term. (Photo: Galen Bacharier/NC Newsline)
After its first reading in the Senate, however, that bill died in the chamber’s powerful Rules Committee, never receiving a hearing before the legislature’s crossover deadline. In a May statement to the Raleigh News & Observer, Berger said while he views HB 2 as an inapt comparison for the new proposal, he did not “see at this point the runway exists for that bill to be passed by the Senate” ahead of the crossover deadline.
That bill also contained the other measure polled by Meredith, a bar on any modifications to sex designation on birth certificates. While the bill did not progress in time for its passage this legislative session, elements of it made into HB 805, the legislation vetoed by Stein. A set of definitions of biological sex and related terms added shortly before the bill’s passage closely mirror those found in the Senate proposal, and a requirement that the original birth certificate must be attached to a modified version evinces a similar aim to the ban on sex marker changes.
It also contained a proposal centered on expanding potential liability for providers of gender affirming care — extending the statute of limitations for malpractice lawsuits involving gender transitions to 10 years and removing a ceiling on damages for such claims. That language was borrowed from House Bill 606, which has yet to see a vote in the Senate.
Veto fight looms as some Democrats defect
Whether Republicans’ most substantive piece of anti-trans legislation becomes law depends on whether any Democrats are willing to help HB 805 overcome Stein’s veto.
So far, the General Assembly’s Republican majority have yet to overturn any of Stein’s vetoes, despite the governor issuing 14 so far this year. Because they are one vote shy of a supermajority in the House, Republicans need to peel off at least one Democrat for a veto override, assuming full attendance.

That would theoretically be attainable for HB 805, but by the slimmest margin. Only a single Democrat in the House opted to support the bill, Rep. Dante Pittman (D-Wilson). According to Chris Cooper, the WCU political scientist, that does not necessarily mean he would back an override effort.
“It’s a pretty significant signal anytime you’re going to go against the Governor who’s a member of your own party,” Cooper said. “I don’t think any legislator enters into that lightly because it could mean that their legislation is less likely to get through later.”
He cautioned that there’s no guarantee that everyone holds their previous vote, meaning it is possible that another Democrat delivers the vote needed to overcome the override. In the House vote on the Parents Protection Act, which Stein declined to veto, eight other Democrats joined Pittman in voting to pass the bill, suggesting a larger contingent of members of the party with some level of willingness to side with Republicans on LGBTQ+ issues.
The state party itself has rebuked anti-trans legislation introduced this term. In a Facebook post in March, the official North Carolina Democratic Party page decried any effort to revive HB2 or similar legislation. “Women do not need Republicans to attack the basic human rights of our transgender community,” the post reads.

Similarly, in a recent interview with NC Newsline for the radio show/podcast News & Views, Senate Democratic leader Sydney Batch was scathing in her assessment of anti-trans legislation. “You know, I don’t understand why Republicans are so obsessed with genitalia.” she said. “Literally, when I’m talking to my constituents, you know, it doesn’t come up. What doesn’t come up is, you know, gender affirming care. What comes up is, ‘hey, you know what, I’ve had a permanent sub in my child’s classroom for the last year, who doesn’t actually know how to teach math.'”
Regardless of the veto fight’s outcome, more legislation restricting trans rights will likely follow so long as public opinion remains on the side of Republicans on the issue. “It’s the culture war issue that’s going to define this term of the General Assembly,” Cooper said.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/transgenderyouth-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-16 06:03:23.238375

(Photo courtesy of Evan Cantwell/George Mason University)When student Hanaan Kazia first heard about the federal civil rights probe into George Mason University, she wasn’t surprised. But the junior political science major and member of the school’s Political Science Honor Society says the implications still scare her.
“I think it is kind of frightening, because I know that one of the reasons that I went to Mason and one of the reasons why other people have attended Mason is because it is one of the most diverse public universities in Virginia,” Kazia told The Mercury in an interview Tuesday. 
“And I think that the multitude of experiences that we have on campus … that the university’s previous DEI practices have made part of the culture here is something that’s really important to me and really important to a lot of other students.”
On Friday, the U.S. Department of Education’s Office for Civil Rights (OCR) announced that it had launched an investigation into GMU over allegations that the school’s diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies violate Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination based on race, color, or national origin in institutions receiving federal funds.
According to the agency, the probe stems from a complaint filed by multiple professors who accuse GMU of giving unlawful preference in hiring and promotion to faculty from “underrepresented groups” in the name of anti-racism. OCR officials argue the university’s DEI practices, in place since 2020, constitute “pernicious and widespread discrimination” that runs afoul of federal law.
“Despite the leadership of George Mason University claiming that it does not discriminate on the basis of race, it appears that its hiring and promotion policies and practices from 2020 to the present … not only allow but champion illegal racial preferencing in violation of Title VI,” said Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Craig Trainor. 
“This kind of pernicious and widespread discrimination — packaged as ‘anti-racism’ — was allowed to flourish under the Biden Administration, but it will not be tolerated by this one.”
OCR cited a number of practices in its opening letter, such as the presence of Equity Advisors in each department who take immutable characteristics into account in hiring; GMU President Gregory Washington’s stated commitment to tenure and promotion criteria that recognize “the invisible and uncredited emotional labor” of faculty of color; and diversity cluster hire initiatives meant to eliminate demographic gaps between students and faculty.
In a university-wide email sent in March, Washington also announced the renaming of GMU’s DEI office to the Office of Access, Compliance, and Community, stating that there was nothing for the university to change because it has “always complied” with existing civil rights laws.
“This is a more specific and intuitively accurate reflection of its charter. It is not an attempt to evade compliance through clever wordsmithing — it simply affirms our actual compliance through more precise naming,” he wrote in the email.
 A broader political context

The new federal probe comes amid an aggressive rollback of DEI initiatives across higher education nationally under pressure from Republican lawmakers and advocacy groups, sanctioned by the administration of President Donald Trump. In Virginia, Gov. Glenn Youngkin has made reducing DEI spending and restructuring public university governance central pillars of his education agenda.
But for Kazia, the charges feel like another escalation in what she sees as a broader political attack on the university’s identity.
“Honestly, it feels kind of like an attack, especially on our student body,” she said. “And we’ve been under these attacks for a long time, at least a few years, especially because before the Trump administration, Governor Youngkin had an eye on us, and we have members of the Heritage Foundation on our board of visitors. So I think it just kind of feels like it’s hurting the university in the long run.”
In a statement Friday, GMU said it received the letter announcing the investigation simultaneously with news outlets.
“George Mason University again affirms its commitment to comply with all federal and state mandates. The university consistently reviews its policies and practices to ensure compliance with federal laws, updated executive orders, and on-going agency directives,” the statement read. 
And: “George Mason does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, religion, ethnic national origin (including shared ancestry and/or ethnic characteristics), sex, disability, military status (including veteran status), sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, pregnancy status, genetic information, or any other characteristic protected by law.”
The latest investigation follows a separate Title VI probe launched earlier this year into GMU’s response to antisemitism on campus.
That case involves allegations from students and faculty that the administration failed to adequately respond to a hostile environment for Jewish individuals after the start of the Israel-Hamas war in October 2023. The school refuted those claims, with Washington stating “antisemitism has no place at George Mason University, and never has.” Some observers argue the Trump administration is using those allegations to build a broader political case against Washington.
 Diverging views on diversity and merit

Recent reporting by ProPublica and NBC News has underscored how the Trump administration’s OCR has increasingly focused on public universities in politically competitive states like Virginia, using Title VI as a mechanism to challenge campus diversity programs.
Liam Keen, a 2024 graduate and former GMU student government leader, pushed back on that idea. 
“Using Jewish identity as a cover for political attempts to restructure an institution is not true support, it’s instrumentalization,” Keen said. “And ultimately, it does more harm than good.”
Keen, who is white and has family ties to GMU, said diversity has always been a core institutional strength.
“Educational institutions are more than places to earn a degree. They’re spaces where we develop a deeper understanding of the world, of each other, and of ourselves,” he said. “That mission can only be achieved when we’re exposed to a variety of perspectives.”
He added, “At GMU, diversity isn’t a slogan, it’s a reflection of who we are, and it’s something students consistently say they want more of, not less.”
The student population at GMU is majority-minority, with more than 50% of students identifying as people of color, but its faculty remains more than 65% white, according to internal reports.
Tim Gibson, a longtime GMU professor and president of the Virginia Conference of the American Association of University Professors, called the latest federal complaint baseless and politically motivated.
“What these policies and these programs do, is they say that we’re going to do it as an institution, where we value the diversity of experience and diversity of perspective … because we think we’re stronger that way,” he said in a phone interview. “It’s not about quotas, it’s not about hiring preferences.”
Gibson argued the Trump administration is mounting an effort to ideologically police public education.
“They are trying to exert more control over scientists and researchers, and in the classroom, to train the next generation of researchers and scientists,” he said. “They’re trying to control the production of knowledge so that it only produces knowledge that agrees with their preexisting views. I think it’s as simple as that.”
Gibson emphasized that the “anti-DEI” movement disregards Virginia’s long history of legally enforced racial exclusion in public education — a history DEI efforts are meant to address.
“I think the argument itself is deeply cynical and ahistoric,” he said. “Let’s not forget that Virginia was a state that was segregated, within living memory, and that African Americans were excluded by law from attending many of our public universities.”
He continued, “Whatever objections President Trump and others have had about universities, I believe are simply because the researchers and universities are publishing research knowledge that contradicts — not for political reasons, but because it’s true — all assumptions and myths about the world. And that is one of the functions of universities.”
 Parallel to UVA controversy

Longtime Virginia political analyst Bob Holsworth said the GMU case shares similarities with the recent controversy at the University of Virginia, where President Jim Ryan resigned under pressure following Title VI complaints and political scrutiny.
“In some ways, it’s similar to UVA, where you have a complaint coming from probably a minority in the university,” Holsworth said. “Now you have a Youngkin-appointed board of visitors that is silent … and you have a federal Department of Education that is really aggressively pursuing the complaints.”
But Holsworth said GMU is an unusual target.
“Mason is certainly not a paragon of intellectual wokeness. It has the Mercatus Center; it has the Antonin Scalia Law School. It probably has more conservative-based intellectual elements than any university in Virginia,” he said. “So it’s kind of surprising, but this no longer seems to matter.”
He added that the political pressure may be tied to Virginia’s upcoming elections, with control of the state’s executive branch and attorney general’s office on the line.
“If the attorney general was a Democrat right now, we’d be in a very different situation with both UVA and George Mason,” Holsworth said, referring to the office’s responsibility to appoint counsel to all of the state universities. “So not only is the governor’s election critically important, but this may be the most important attorney general election in a generation.”
 Voices of support and resistance

Former Gov. Doug Wilder, the nation’s first Black governor and a GMU supporter, framed the attack on GMU’s president in historical terms.
“The elementary school I attended had no cafeteria, no auditorium, and had outdoor toilets. It was named for George Mason,” Wilder recalled. “I learned that George Mason was an early American patriot who believed that education and commitment could lead to the fullest participation in the American dream. I wonder how he would feel today about the university which bears his name and its treatment of its first president of color.”
Wilder also pointed to a pattern: “(Washington) is not the only person of color heading our colleges and universities being subjected to specious and questionable charges,” he said, referencing Cedric Wins at Virginia Military Institute, who in February was ousted in a move that sparked widespread pushback.  
Three Democratic GMU alumni now serving in Virginia’s state Senate also issued a joint statement of support of Washington and the university he leads.
“From 2020 to 2025, GMU jumped from 45 to 30 in Wall Street Journal Public University Rankings, and from 72 to 51 in US News Public Institution rankings, all while maintaining affordability near our nation’s capital,” said Sens. Jeremy McPike, Stella Pekarsky, and Saddam Azlan Salim. “Instead, following the successful attack on UVA President Jim Ryan, opportunists have set their sights on another of Virginia’s prized universities.”
“To claim that anti-racism is racially discriminatory makes a mockery of the laws the Department claims to be enforcing,” they added. “We call on the U.S. Department of Education to end this sham investigation.”
For students like Kazia, the values at stake go far beyond policy documents or legal interpretations.
“These attacks aren’t necessarily new, but they are ramping up in a way that is frightening, especially for the culture and the environment of our university,” she said. “It’s going to harm all of us in the long run.”
GMU’s Gibson offered a final reflection on the broader context.
“That is the history that diversity, equity, and inclusion programs since the civil rights movement have been trying to redress,” he said. 
“And these programs are about opening that door and then basically sending invitations to groups that have been historically excluded. That is really the point. It’s not about political favoritism, it’s about fulfilling a promise.”

(Photo by Charlotte Rene Woods/Virginia Mercury)As the state grapples with public concerns about conditions inside prisons and the complaint reporting process, prisoners’ grievances are on track to being heard and, when possible, investigated, Virginia Corrections Ombudsman Andrea Sapone shared in a meeting Tuesday. 
The volume of recent complaints are a big challenge.  Some aren’t under her office’s purview (like those stemming from local or regional jails) while others are duplicate or near-duplicate mass emails the office has to ensure aren’t all separate issues.
New Virginia investigator to streamline complaint filing for incarcerated people and their families

Of the over 500 complaints her team is exploring, 269 of those stem from Red Onion State Prison, Sapone said. 
After a handful of residents burned themselves last year, the Southwest Virginia prison has been under heightened scrutiny from inmate families, advocacy groups and state lawmakers. Last winter, Sapone announced that her office will investigate the facility, though it remains unable to comment further until the process is complete, she said Tuesday. 
Her office is also working on a memorandum of understanding with the Virginia Department of Corrections to facilitate how to share records and other information relating to investigations. Sapone said her team has finalized its draft and is awaiting a response from VADOC. 
The Mercury made a Freedom of Information Act request for the ombudsman’s draft of the MOU, but the overarching Office of the State Inspector General rejected it. The office cited state code meant to protect records relating to investigations as the reason it was exempt from filling the request. Though Sapone plans to investigate VADOC’s Red Onion, her office confirmed the MOU is not specific to an investigation.
As VADOC is deliberating, spokesman Kyle Gibson said the department “does not want to speculate on a completed time frame.”
 ‘Brutality is real’

Sapone’s office has been staffing up to conduct general inspections of state prison facilities and handle the variety of complaints it receives from inmates, their family members or advocacy organizations that communicate with prisoners. 
During a meeting in Richmond on Tuesday, organizations relayed what they’ve been hearing — with some anecdotes also shared by Sapone herself. 
Speakers alleged a lack of access to health care or mental health services for inmates, restricted visitation or communication with family or lawyers, along with allegations of discrimination or mistreatment from corrections staff and prolonged lockdowns or use of isolation.
Advocates rally for investigation into Red Onion State prison, press for reforms

Several such claims have percolated over the last year stemming from Red Onion, prompting two state lawmakers to make unannounced visits there. They said they saw a a lack of meaningful out-of-cell time for people, despite state law requiring inmates in isolated housing to have congregate time. 
The Department of Corrections last year denied allegations of mistreatment in communications to the Mercury and other media. 
“The Department has zero tolerance for any form of abuse and investigates all such allegations,” Dotson said in a statement. 
Recent documents obtained by VPM News show a highly-redacted internal probe refuting allegations of staff misconduct.  
Allegations of mistreatment by officers at nearby Wallens Ridge prison have also erupted. In May, three officers were harmed by some gang-affiliated inmates, resulting in a subsequent lockdown. Gibson confirmed to The Mercury at the time that visitations, calls and video were suspended as a result.
An external review of Virginia’s prisons  last year noted understaffing at several facilities and the role it may play in population management lockdowns. Understaffed facilities means inmates are more likely to be cut off from educational and rehabilitative programming. 
It also poses security risks to staff and residents alike, the report outlined. 
“This lack of staff impacts every aspect of facility operations and results in facilities that are unsafe,” the report stated. 
“Brutality is real in prison,” said Nicole Deyo, founder of prison reform nonprofit Bending the Bars. “(Prisoners) were committed to a sentence (and) the DOC agreed to house these individuals in a humane way. The purpose is for development and rehabilitation. At the end of the day, these people are coming home so we have to prepare them.”
Deyo said there should be more transparency of the grievance process for inmates and their families. Representatives of Uniting Prisoners’ Relatives Organizing Against Repression, or UPROAR, have also said inmates who voice their concerns face retaliation. 
While these allegations have yet to be proven or disproven, some inmates have reached out to The Mercury intermittently for nearly a year to relay grievances or note when they’ve lost access to JPay — a message service for inmates.
Ekong Eshiet, who was among those to burn themselves in protest last year, and who has since been transferred, has made similar claims. Some state lawmakers and activists speculated that the burnings were cries for help and a form of protest. The Department of Corrections director Chad Dotson refuted that. 
Last November Dotson attributed the incidents to mental health issues and took aim at advocacy groups and certain lawmakers. 
“The recent round of stories about Red Onion are nothing more than bad-faith efforts to try to score cheap political points by advocacy groups who pursue prison abolition and policies that would make Virginians less safe,” he said. 
In December, Dotson suggested some inmates just wanted to be transferred elsewhere to be closer to family. Red Onion is based on the far west side of Virginia, with residents from around the state and elsewhere housed there.
Eshiet acknowledged such a desire in an email to The Mercury, but said the burning was an escalation of  a previous hunger strike  to protest his living conditions and seek a transfer in general. Eshiet has alleged he has been discriminated against for his Muslim faith and has felt unsafe around some correctional officers.
In March, ahead of his transfer, Eshiet wrote to The Mercury  that he was hopeful  prisoners’ concerns were catching the outside world’s attention and his inspirations for when he completes his sentence and re-enters society. 
“Most of my life has been wicked but I am better than every evil deed that I ever committed,” Eshiet said. “The plan is to make a change for the better & hopefully I can help others change for the better. It’s not necessarily about how (you) start life but more importantly about how (you) finish it. I must leave a good trace in this realm.”
 Hundreds of complaints, hundreds of miles

While complaints stemming from state-run prisons are not new, Sapone’s position to look into them is. First established last summer from a new state law, Sapone was hired in late September. Her office spent this winter and spring hiring additional staff and are now seeking more that can help sort through and triage complaints. 
It’s a tall order for a small team, said Maggie Sotos, the OSIG communications manager. She noted that states like New Jersey have a larger staff to do what Sapone’s office does in Virginia. Virginia’s largest congressional district is roughly the size of the state of New Jersey. 
Outside of its pending Red Onion investigation, Sapone’s office conducts drop-in inspections of Virginia’s prisons throughout the year, driving hundreds of miles to do so. 
“We’re hoping (the hires) can help delegate the labor a little bit more,” Sotos said. “We can have dedicated folks who can do the intake of these complaints and we can have our other staff members out in the field. That way we can have more parallel progress instead of it being bogged down at the same time.”
For now, Sapone said she plans to host another meeting this fall or winter where she and staff can share further updates.

There is so much to think about in the hours, days, and weeks after a disaster. Whether you’re seeking shelter, wondering how to clean up safely, or looking for financial help, there are an overwhelming number of requirements, agencies, and laws to navigate. We’ve got some tips and tricks to help you through it.
This tool kit is meant to help you understand how federal, state, and local disaster response works during and after a disaster — and what your rights and responsibilities are at a stressful and confusing time.

Finding accurate information
During and after a disaster, you may lose internet and cell service for an extended period of time. Here are a few tips to staying connected and informed:

Check your local library. Libraries often have power when other city buildings do not, and they offer free Wi-Fi and computers.
Listen to the radio. Your local NPR station or your talk radio station will provide updated information. You can tune in from your car or use a hand crank radio. NOAA weather stations broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a week, though accessing it requires a NOAA weather radio or a radio with NOAA weather station features.
Sign up for local emergency alerts. Local officials are the best source of information. Your city or county has an emergency management department. In larger cities, it’s often a separate agency; in smaller communities, the fire department or county sheriff’s office may manage emergency response and alerts. If you’re having trouble finding your local department, search for your state or territory here; we also suggest typing your city or county name and “emergency management” or “emergency alerts” into Google for a quick find.

When you do find cell service or internet access:

Read your local news sources. Check the library or other community hubs if you don’t have a subscription and hit a paywall.
Check the American Red Cross for shelters and services.
Check your county or city website for updates.
Download the FEMA app on Google Play or the Apple App Store to get alerts, find emergency shelters, and more. You can also download the app by texting ANDROID or APPLE (per the type of device that you have) to 43362 (4FEMA).

Legal resources:
Disclaimer: We are not offering legal advice; this is only to offer contact information for organizations that can offer legal resources and services.
We encourage you to find legal aid societies and lawyers in your state, city, or region. You can often access free or pro-bono legal services through disaster relief organizations, houses of worship, local nonprofits, or by asking leaders at supply distribution sites after a disaster. Your local news will likely be sharing this information, as well.
Emergency Legal Responders provides free, accessible, and easily understandable information and services. They have a website with a host of resources on everything from bankruptcy to fraud to how legal needs often play out after a disaster. Find them on Instagram.
Mutual aid:
Mutual aid is a voluntary, collaborative exchange of resources, money, and services among community members. These groups are often local or regional, and they are more nimble and quick to respond in emergency situations because of their decentralized nature. Depending on how much funding comes in after a disaster, mutual aid groups can directly send money to those in need, purchase supplies, set up distribution sites, and more. Mutual Aid Disaster Relief, a grassroots disaster relief network, has a list of mutual aid groups it works with, and there are many more popping up all the time. Mutual aid groups often offer resources and updates as well and share via social media; make sure you fact check any information you see to confirm it’s correct.
Emergency response agencies and officials
It can be hard to know who to trust when it comes to natural disasters. Where do official evacuation orders come from? Who do you call if you need to be rescued? Where can you get money to help pay for emergency housing or to rebuild your home or community?
Here’s a breakdown of the officials and agencies in charge of delivering aid before, during, and after a disaster:
Emergency management agencies: Almost all cities and counties have local emergency management departments. Sometimes it’s a standalone agency, but in smaller communities, the fire department or sheriff’s office may manage emergency response and alerts. These departments are responsible for communicating with the public, managing rescue and response efforts, and coordinating between other agencies. Many emergency management agencies, however, have small staffs and are under-resourced.
Much of the work that emergency managers do happens before a disaster: They develop response plans that lay out evacuation routes and communication procedures and they delegate responsibility to different agencies like the police, fire, and public health departments. Most counties and cities publish these plans online.
In most cases, they are the most trustworthy resource before and after a hurricane or other catastrophe. They’ll issue alerts and warnings, coordinate evacuations, and direct people to resources and shelter. You can find your state emergency management agency here. There isn’t a comprehensive list by county or city, but if you search your location online you’ll likely find a website, a page on the county or city website, or a Facebook page that posts updates. Some emergency management agencies automatically translate into Spanish or other languages — New York and Hawaiʻi mandate their own statewide emergency translation services — but not all.
Law enforcement: County sheriffs and city police departments play a key role during disasters. They often enforce evacuation orders, going door-to-door to ensure that people leave. They manage traffic during evacuations and help conduct search-and-rescue operations.
Law enforcement agencies may restrict access to affected areas after a flood or other disaster. In most states, city and county governments also have the power to set a curfew, and officers can enforce them with fines or even arrests.

Governor: Governors control several key aspects of disaster response in their states. They have the power to declare a state of emergency, which allows them to deploy rescue and repair workers, distribute financial assistance to local governments, and activate the National Guard. The governor plays a lead role in the immediate aftermath of a crisis, but a smaller one in distributing aid and assistance to individuals.
In almost every state, including all of the hurricane-prone states along the Gulf coast, the governor also has the power to announce evacuation orders. The penalty for ignoring them differs, but is usually a fine. (States seldom enforce these penalties.) The state government also decides whether to implement transportation procedures like contraflow, where all lanes of a highway flow in the same direction to facilitate evacuations.
FEMA: The Federal Emergency Management Agency is the federal government’s main disaster response organization, offering resources and funding for individuals, states, and local governments. It is part of the Department of Homeland Security.
HUD: The Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, spends billions of dollars to help communities recover after disasters, building new housing and other buildings such as schools — but this money takes much longer to arrive. Unlike FEMA, HUD must wait for Congress to approve its post-disaster work, and then it must dole out grants for specific projects. In some cases, such as the aftermath of Hurricane Laura in Louisiana or Hurricane Florence in North Carolina, it has taken years for projects to get off the ground.
States and local governments, not individual people, apply for money from HUD, but the agency can direct you to FEMA or housing counselors.
How FEMA works
FEMA is rarely the first resource on the ground after a disaster strikes. In order for the agency to send resources to a disaster area, the state’s governor must first request a disaster declaration from the president, and the president must approve it.
Read more: What exactly is a natural disaster?
For large disasters such as Category 4 or 5 hurricanes, this typically happens quickly. For a smaller crisis, like severe rain or flooding, it can take weeks or even months for the president to grant a declaration and activate the agency. FEMA has historically not responded to heat waves because it does not consider them a type of disaster.
FEMA is divided into regional offices and offers specific contacts and information for each of them, and for tribal nations, which follow a different process. You can find your FEMA region here.
The agency has two primary roles after a federally declared disaster:

Contributing to community rebuilding costs: The agency helps states and local governments pay for the cost of removing debris and rebuilding public infrastructure. (Read more about FEMA’s responsibilities and programs here.)
Individual financial assistance: FEMA awards financial assistance to individual people who have lost their homes and belongings. It can take several forms: FEMA gives out pre-loaded debit cards to help people buy food and fuel in the first days after a disaster, and may also provide cash payments for home repairs. The agency also provides up to 18 months of housing assistance for people who lose their homes, and sometimes houses disaster survivors in trailers. FEMA sometimes covers funeral costs as well as medical and dental treatment.

FEMA also runs other programs, including the National Flood Insurance Program, which provides insurance via dozens of companies it works with, and enforces floodplain management regulations. The agency recommends that everyone who lives in a flood zone purchase this coverage — and most mortgage lenders require it if you live in a flood zone — though many homes beyond these areas are also vulnerable. You must begin paying for flood insurance at least 30 days before a disaster to be eligible for a payout. You can check if your home is in a flood zone by using this FEMA website.
Visiting a FEMA recovery center
FEMA disaster recovery centers provide information about the agency’s programs as well as other state and local resources. It will open these centers in impacted areas in the days and weeks following a federally declared disaster. FEMA representatives can help navigate the aid application process or direct you to nonprofits, shelters, or state and local resources. Go to this website to locate one in your area, or text DRC and a ZIP Code to 43362.
Finding shelter and staying safe
If an emergency forces you from your home, there are several ways to find a shelter.

The American Red Cross operates overnight shelters and disaster relief centers where you can get health services, do laundry, get toiletries and other necessary supplies, and rest. Pets are usually welcome, and entry is free. Locate them here.
Text SHELTER and your ZIP code to 43362 to find a FEMA shelter.
Call 211 to find more information about emergency housing, shelters, or assistance paying for housing.
Michigan’s 211 has a search engine to locate emergency shelter by ZIP code.
Most cities and counties will have a list of shelters available. Check your local .gov website, or your local news site, for options. You can also check with local community organizations you know and trust.

For people with disabilities:

You have a right to meals and snacks that meet your dietary and medical needs, your service animal, a physically accessible shelter, and sign language interpreters, Braille, large print, or other formats you may need to access information. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health created a tool called Show Me that can be downloaded as an app or printed out. It’s a visual guide to emergency shelters that can be used by residents who have cognitive disabilities, are deaf or hard of hearing, have limited English proficiency, or may struggle to communicate during an emergency.
Call 211 to get your questions answered (you can remain anonymous) or find your local 211 through the United Way.
The National Disability Rights Network has Protection and Advocacy (P&A) Systems and Client Assistance Programs (CAP) in every state U.S. territory as well as one serving the Native American population in the four corners region. They can help you advocate for yourself. You can find the closest one to you here.

The most important thing to consider during a disaster is safety — for you, your family, and your community. You may experience a power outage before or during a disaster. Here are some ways to prepare and stay safe:

Your utility company may alert you of changes, so sign up for texts or calls from them.
If your power does go out, keep your refrigerator closed as much as possible and eat perishable food first. Get some coolers with ice if possible, and if you’re in doubt about any food, throw it out.
Unplug appliances and electronics, and use flashlights instead of candles to reduce the risk of fire.
Carbon monoxide poisoning is one of the leading causes of death after a storm that knocks out power. Do not use a gas stove to heat your home and do not use barbecues, grills, or other outdoor cooking equipment inside, because they can generate carbon monoxide. If you have a generator, keep it outside in a well ventilated area away from windows. The Red Cross has more generator safety tips.

Signs and symptoms of illnesses
Heat stroke and exhaustion: Symptoms include muscle cramping, unusually heavy sweating, shortness of breath, headaches, dizziness, and fatigue or weakness. Learn more here from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about how to spot these signs and protect yourself.
Carbon monoxide poisoning: It can take just minutes to get carbon monoxide poisoning. Be on the lookout for nausea, a mild headache, and shortness of breath. More severe cases can cause confusion, chest pain, dizziness, severe headaches, and loss of coordination. The Mayo Clinic has more information on what to look out for, and FEMA has information on how to prevent carbon monoxide leaks.
Tetanus: This is an infection caused by bacteria. It’s rare, but can be more common after disasters because it’s more likely people come into contact with rusty nails, needles, or contaminated dirt. The most common symptom, which can occur anywhere from three to 21 days after exposure, is lockjaw. Tetanus is easily prevented with a vaccine. Read more here from the CDC.
Respiratory issues from poor air quality: If you can see haze and smell smoke, the air quality is poor and you should limit your outdoor activities. Soot and smoke from fires contain particulate matter, or PM. Signs of irritation include persistent coughing, phlegm, wheezing, and difficulty breathing, as well as asthma attacks or elevated heart rates. Children, the elderly, and people with heart or lung disease are most at risk.

Applying for FEMA assistance
There is a specific process cities, states, and tribal governments must navigate in order for residents to receive FEMA aid. If you are a U.S. citizen, or meet certain qualifications as a non-citizen, and live in a disaster declaration area that was approved by FEMA and the president, you are eligible to apply for aid immediately after they announce it. You can apply on disasterassistance.gov, through the FEMA app, or at a FEMA recovery center. FEMA offers survivors eligible for individual assistance:

A one-time grant of $750 for emergency needs and essential items like food, baby items, and medication
Temporary housing assistance equivalent to 14 nights in a hotel in your area
Up to 18 months of rental assistance
Payments for lost property that isn’t covered by your homeowners or renters insurance
Other forms of assistance, depending on your needs and losses

First, you’ll need to gather your paperwork. You will need documents to verify everything from your identity to proof of residency and living expenses. FEMA has a list of documents you can submit to prove home ownership (like mortgage statements, property tax bills, a deed or title) or proof of residency if you don’t own your home (lease or housing agreement, bank or credit card statement, motor vehicle registration form, pay stub, credit card statements, utility bills). These documents should be dated within the past year. Your driver’s license, state-issued identification card, or voter registration card is valid only if it is current and was issued before the disaster happened.

Hotel receipts, if you were forced to evacuate
Receipts, serial numbers, and appraisals for valuable items, if you lose things like appliances, furnishing, and accessibility equipment. This may help you with both insurance claims and FEMA aid
If you are on a visa, green card, or other form of legal residency, make sure to have copies of all your immigration paperwork
Photos of your home before it was damaged or destroyed

The agency has some advice on how to replace lost documents here; you should apply for aid even if you don’t have all the necessary paperwork.
Second, prepare for an inspection. After you apply, FEMA must verify the damage through an onsite or remote inspection. FEMA employees and inspectors may call from an unknown or restricted phone number and make several attempts to discuss your disaster-caused damage — so be on the lookout for that. You’ll have to be present for the inspection, though you may be able to meet elsewhere if your home is inaccessible. You don’t have to wait for this inspection to begin cleaning up, but make sure you take photos before you do.
After disasters, inaccurate or misleading information can spread quickly. FEMA debunks some common myths here.
Some facts about FEMA’s aid process that are often misconstrued:

Payments provided by FEMA are grants, not loans. You do not have to pay them back.
Keep all receipts for your expenses while displaced from your home, or repairs made to your home, as well as notes of calls with FEMA or other disaster aid officials or insurance companies.
FEMA will require you to create an account on the secure website Login.gov. Use this account to submit your aid application. You can track the status of your aid application via the app or this website and receive notifications if FEMA needs more information from you.
If FEMA denies your application for aid, you can appeal, but the process is lengthy.
You can apply for individual assistance for multiple storms, but you can apply only once for each disaster.
You can use GoFundMe or other crowdfunding platforms to get money faster. Donations are considered gifts, and will not be counted in your gross income, as long as you don’t promise donors anything in exchange. However, you can’t seek other sources of financial aid to cover any expenses included in your online campaign.

Applying for FEMA rental assistance
You must apply for individual disaster assistance to be considered for rental assistance. FEMA funds can be used for rent, including a security deposit, and utilities such as electricity and water, at a house, apartment, hotel, or recreational vehicle that is not your damaged home. Residents in counties with a federal disaster declaration are eligible to apply under FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program. The rate is set by an area’s Fair Market Rent; find yours here.
Here are some key things to know about FEMA rental assistance:

If you were already approved for rental assistance, an application for continued rental assistance is normally mailed to you 15 days after the grant is approved. If you do not receive one, call FEMA at 800-621-3362 or visit a disaster recovery center.
To receive continuing assistance, you must be able to demonstrate ongoing need and prove you are working toward securing permanent housing or making progress on repairs. A contractor’s estimate meets that requirement.
Extensions on rental assistance may be granted for three-month periods up to a maximum of 18 months after the disaster.
You may receive an automated phone call with a notification about ongoing assistance, so answer unknown numbers.
If FEMA denies your application or you need more than the amount awarded, you can appeal. It must be submitted within 60 days of the date on the FEMA decision letter. The appeal process is often lengthy. Here’s more information.
You’ll have to meet specific requirements for any FEMA aid you receive or reimbursements you plan to ask for.

Finding help with applications
The FEMA application process can be confusing and lengthy. Important tips when applying for disaster assistance with FEMA can be found here (please note this was last updated after Hurricane Helene in 2024). There are almost always lawyers and legal organizations offering free help with applications in any disaster area.
Documenting damage
If and when it’s safe to return home, it’s critical that you photograph everything that was damaged and gather any documents you can salvage for insurance claims and government aid applications.
Before you begin:

Turn off your electricity and gas (here’s how).
Have a first aid kit handy.
Make sure your tetanus shot is up to date (your state or county health department may offer free tetanus vaccines if you need one; it’s best to call them to find out).
Look at the structural integrity of the building before entering, and do not go inside if it looks like there is any potential for something to collapse. Do not touch anything electrical if in doubt about the state it’s in.
Wear protective clothing: long sleeves and pants, goggles, leather, rubber or plastic gloves, closed-toed and/or sturdy boots or shoes, a respirator or N95 mask, and a Tyvek suit if you can find one. Check with your aid distribution sites for tools, personal protective equipment, and cleaning materials.
Do not attempt to drive or wade through floodwaters, which can sweep you away even if it doesn’t seem deep, and can be contaminated or contain dangerous debris. Do not touch any debris or materials that may be contaminated by toxic chemicals (you may need special equipment or PPE to handle burned or flooded debris).

Take photos and videos
Whether you have insurance and are filing a claim, or you do not have flood insurance and you’re applying for federal assistance from FEMA, you’ll need a lot of evidence to prove the damage was caused by a disaster.

Gather any photos of your house or apartment from before the crisis so you can more easily document your losses.
Take photos of the outside and inside of your home or apartment, including damaged personal property, and label them by room before you remove anything.
If you have insurance, take photos of the make, model, and serial number for appliances and anything else of value. Provide receipts to your adjuster to document damage for your claim.

Cleaning your home
After documenting damage, you can begin to clean up. Here’s information on how to navigate the process after a wildfire. Here is a booklet from the Environmental Protection Agency that is a helpful visual resource on doing the job after a flood. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services also has a guide to staying safe after a flood.
Mucking and gutting
Mucking involves removing mud, silt, and other sediment. Gutting means moving damaged drywall, insulation, cabinets, floorboards, and paneling out of your home. (Here’s a helpful visual guide from Galveston County, Texas emergency management on this process.)
Some key things to keep in mind (Virginia’s Department of Health has more tips):

Take wet items outside to dry.
Open doors and windows to air out your home, and use fans if possible.
Remove all mold you see (more on this below) and try to dry as much as possible.
Discard anything that can’t be cleaned and dried within two days. Throw away perishables, clothing, cushions, and pillows. It can be difficult to throw away items with sentimental value — but anything soaked in floodwater or sewage poses a health risk.
Keep samples of damaged carpet, upholstery, and wallpaper if you plan on filing an insurance claim.

Mold
Here’s a fact sheet on mold risks and how to clean it up, from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. The key is moisture control. You may not be able to see all of the mold developing in your home after flooding. According to FEMA, “everything that has been contaminated must be cleaned and dried. Items that cannot be properly cleaned and dried within 24-48 hours must be discarded, including building materials and personal property.” People with breathing problems like asthma or a weakened immune system should stay away.
You will likely see a lot of bleach at distribution sites. According to the EPA, bleach is not recommended for cleaning up mold. You can use bleach on hard, nonporous surfaces like countertops, but do not use it on porous surfaces like wood to kill mold — make sure those dry completely before deciding whether to keep them. If using bleach, ventilate the area and never mix it with other cleaning solutions or detergents that contain ammonia, because it could produce toxic fumes.
Debris cleanup
Whether you’re a homeowner or business owner, you must follow local guidelines for debris cleanup, which can take weeks or months. Your local officials will have a schedule for curbside pickup or pickups in designated areas, but it’s your responsibility to get everything there. Volunteer organizations often help haul debris to the curb or remove fallen trees, drywall, and other material. They also might help with removing flooring and appliances, tarping roofs, and eliminating mold. FEMA has guidelines for doing all of this safely.
States or counties may have their own processes for this. Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy has a webpage with details on how best to handle and dispose of debris.
Finding help with cleanup
After a disaster, charities and nonprofits can help with house inspections, mucking and gutting, as well as tree and debris removal. Contact Crisis Cleanup at 844-965-1386 to get connected with community groups and faith-based organizations. These services are free but not guaranteed due to overwhelming demand. Check your city or county website, your local news, or local organizations you trust for options.

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
 The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

– Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations


Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
 Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

Disaster recovery is not a simple process. It takes months, even years, for communities to distribute aid, rebuild, and begin to move forward. Your landscape and community has likely changed in many ways: People leave and don’t return, infrastructure and businesses are damaged or gone. And if you have lived through it, you’ve probably changed, too. The attention on your community will fade after a few weeks, and then it’s left to those who stay to manage this process and hopefully prevent catastrophic damage from the next disaster.
That’s no easy task. Grist has a toolkit below for long-term recovery, including how to take care of your mental health and well-being, how to find unemployment and assistance programs, and how to keep tabs on disaster aid in your area so you know the right questions to ask. Most importantly, we want to offer you resources — locally, regionally, and nationally — that can help you navigate the road ahead.

Managing long-term recovery
For any community, it’s important to have coordination and communication among public, private, and nonprofit organizations throughout the recovery process. According to this graphic from the city of Oʻahu, Hawaiʻi, long-term recovery can include everything that public and private sectors work together on, such as rebuilding infrastructure, financial assistance, economic and workforce development programs, redesigning codes and plans to protect people from future disasters, and more.
The National Voluntary Organizations Active in Disaster, or VOAD, has some helpful things to consider when working on long-term community and individual recovery:

Consider creating a long-term recovery group with other stakeholders in your community if one does not already exist. This can be informal or turned into a 501(c)(3) nonprofit. This ensures that the local community is leading the way, but there should be clear guidelines and a diverse and inclusive group of stakeholders involved. VOAD has considerations for creating these groups and managing their budgets here.
Consider hosting public gatherings and memorials in the months and years after disasters to mark the event and support community members during difficult times. These should involve survivors, local faith leaders, and other trusted leaders.
Keep track of unmet needs — anything from private roads that need repair to waterways that need cleaning up to random issues that arise months later — and develop a way to prioritize them. This can help you figure out where to access funding and who is being left out of the recovery process. Here’s an example of what that looked like a year after Hurricane Laura.

Mental health resources
Disasters affect people in many different ways, and it’s normal to grieve your losses — personal, professional, community — in your own time. You may feel sad, angry, or fearful. In 2021, Southerly interviewed Kevin Yaudes, who runs the Kay Doré Counseling Clinic at McNeese State University, in Lake Charles, Louisiana, after Hurricanes Laura and Delta hit the southwest part of the state. “The effort to be positive and move forward was so strong that it was clouding the fact that the storms had taken their toll,” Yaudes said. “Two things can be true at the same time. It is OK to feel both sorrow for loss and gratitude that the situation was manageable.” For many residents, knowing there were affordable options for counseling, and that others were experiencing similar feelings, was important.
Disaster relief organizations, churches, mutual aid groups that offer direct financial support (you can find many mutual aid groups here), and other institutions will likely offer free or affordable counseling, or can direct you to the right place. Check your local government website, local news TV stations, newspapers, and local radio stations for options.
General mental health helplines:

If you are feeling suicidal, call 988 or start an online chat with someone through the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifelife (en Español).
Veterans going through a crisis can also dial 988 for the Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, and press 1, or chat online here.
The National Alliance on Mental Health, or NAMI, has a network of organizations and affiliates across the U.S. Find the closest one to you here. You can also text “helpline” to 62640 or call 1-800-950-6264 (en Español).

Disaster helplines and resources:

The American Red Cross has mental health volunteers they often dispatch to areas hit by a disaster. They have guides in multiple languages about mental and emotional health.
The Crisis Counseling Assistance and Training Program is a short-term disaster relief grant program, funded by FEMA and managed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, or SAMHSA. It is available to states, U.S. territories, and federally recognized tribes in a federal disaster declaration area. Email dtac@samhsa.hhs.gov to learn if there’s a program in your area.
SAMHSA also has many fact sheets for coping with disasters and trauma here.

All of these agencies and organizations will point you to the Disaster Distress Helpline that provides 24/7 crisis counseling and support. Call or text 1-800-985-5990 for English and Spanish.
However, there are limitations with the helpline: In 2020, the Center for Public Integrity and Columbia Journalism Investigations teamed up with local news outlets across the country to examine the toll disasters take on mental health. They found that federal programs reach just a fraction of survivors, and that communities were creating their own counseling programs to fill in the gaps. Here are some of the tips they gathered from people who have lived through disasters.
Substance abuse resources
Research shows that disasters can result in increased alcohol and drug use among people who previously did not use them, and relapses for those who have struggled with alcohol and drug abuse disorders. Not only is it an exceptionally stressful and triggering time, but services can be disrupted if buildings are destroyed or people are displaced.
Gathered from a variety of clinics as well as federal and state resources, here are some ways to cope after a disaster if you struggle with drugs or alcohol:

Check your local Alcoholics Anonymous, Narcotics Anonymous, health care provider, or SMART Recovery for meeting updates and location changes.
Find local substance abuse resources. The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services provides a county-specific list.
Reach out to your sponsors, old friends who have helped you in the past, or family you trust. If you suspect someone you know is struggling, here are some ways to help them, from the Minnesota Department of Health.
There are many ways you can try to keep to a routine. An Illinois-based clinic called Rosecrance has some helpful tips here.
SAMHSA’s National Helpline is confidential, free, and available anytime in English and Spanish. Call 1-800-662-4357, visit SAMHSA’s online treatment locator, or text your ZIP code to 435748 to find help near you.

Fraud and scams
There’s always the risk of fraud as con artists posting as government officials or unscrupulous contractors try to bilk people out of their money or rip them off with shoddy work. Here’s a timeline of how disaster fraud often plays out. A few tips can minimize the risk.

Verify the identity of anyone who approaches you unsolicited with offers of help. Ask for identification. FEMA employees, housing inspectors, and other government officials carry official IDs. A government uniform is not proof of identification.
Government officials will not ask you for money or for financial information. Do not trust anyone who seeks payment up front or promises a loan or grant.
Work with reputable contractors and check their credentials and licenses before hiring them (more on this below). Here are some tips from the National Insurance Crime Bureau to avoid getting taken.
Ask for written quotes and contracts throughout the process.

If you have knowledge of fraud, waste, or abuse, you can report it to the FEMA Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or email StopFEMAFraud@fema.dhs.gov. You also can contact the National Center for Disaster Fraud. Before calling, gather as many details as possible, including how and where it occurred. You can also report it to your state’s attorney general or local law enforcement.
Emergency Legal Responders, which provides free, accessible, and easily understandable information and services, has a form to report disaster scams you encounter so they can find patterns and update resources for the public.

Preparing for the next disaster
Repeated exposure to major disasters can take a heavy toll on your mental health, according to a 2022 study from Texas A&M University School of Public Health. People who experienced two or more events over the past five years had mental health scores below national levels. These mental health challenges can manifest in a variety of ways. For some people, reactions to stress can feel just as intense as the first time. For example, you may get extremely anxious when you hear heavy rainfall after you’ve survived a flood. NAMI has tips on identifying signs and dealing with triggering events here.
Read more: How to protect your health if a disaster strikes your community
As extreme weather becomes more frequent and intense, it’s not out of the realm of possibility that you’ll experience multiple disasters in a short time span. It’s important to stay prepared — especially if you were caught off guard the first time.
Read more: How to prepare for a disaster
Federal assistance programs you may be eligible for
Disaster-related unemployment
The Disaster Unemployment Assistance program provides temporary benefits to people who, as a result of a major disaster, lost their jobs or had their self-employment interrupted. You are eligible for this assistance if you live in a city, county, or state where a federal disaster declaration has been made and you aren’t eligible for regular unemployment insurance benefits. You must file a claim with your state insurance agency. If you have evacuated to another state, you can still apply.
To learn more, contact your state’s unemployment office. Search for yours here. If you’ve moved or have been evacuated to another state, contact your home state. The Department of Labor also has other tips if you need to find a job, relocate, or replace your driver’s license, birth certificate, or other documents.
H-2A worker assistance
If you are an agricultural worker on a temporary visa and you lose a job when a flood or storm hits, your employer must give you up to 75 percent of your lost wages. This is a federal law. If you are an H-2A worker and your employer does not provide these lost wages, you can file a complaint with the Department of Labor. (Here are instructions in English and Español on how to do that.) Some people have reported retaliation for making a complaint about working conditions. You can tell the Department of Labor if you think this has happened to you.

How to track disaster spending in your community
After a disaster, huge sums of money trickle down and change hands to fund debris cleanup, repairs, reconstruction, and more. We hope these tips will be helpful for local journalists looking for stories after a disaster, as well as community members who are interested in better understanding how projects are prioritized and funding is distributed.

Attend your local city council, county commission, and school board meetings. If structures like schools and city buildings are destroyed, your county or city will be designating funding for repairs and rebuilds. By attending meetings and asking questions, you can stay updated and make sure local officials are spending money on the things that should be prioritized first. Here’s an example from Southerly, which hired residents of Lake Charles, Louisiana, to take notes at meetings and write about the patterns they saw after Hurricane Laura.
You can also use these meetings, plus news stories or press releases from the offices of your governor or mayor, to track what companies governments are contracting with to clean up debris, repair roads and buildings, and more. For example, the Kentucky Center for Investigative Reporting reported on complaints and lawsuits against a debris cleanup company accused of taking property without consent and leaving flood debris behind that clogged waterways in 2022. The city of Louisville hired the same company to clean up after floods in 2025.
Pay attention to how your neighbors and family members are doing as they wait for federal or state funding for repairs for their homes or businesses, or other housing assistance. If you’re going through the process yourself, take notes about everything and keep track of your documents. Here’s another example from Hurricane Laura.
Know what data to look at. FEMA is required by law to provide a report by the fifth day of each month on the Disaster Relief Fund, “which includes a funding summary, a table delineating the DRF funding activities each month by state and event, a summary of the funding for the catastrophic events, and an estimate of the date on which the funds will be exhausted.” You can search for these reports here. In addition, the agency must update the OpenFEMA dataset frequently after disasters; it provides detailed applicant-level data on the agency’s individual and households program. After the 2022 Kentucky floods, an Appalachian think tank tracked funding for housing rebuilds using this data. Here’s a link to more datasets from OpenFEMA.

Questions to ask about long-term recovery
There are other aspects of the recovery process in the months and years after a disaster that it’s important to be aware of. Here are some questions to ask your local officials and community leaders:

How is the rebuilding effort making homes and businesses safer for future disasters? Are developers and the local government putting homes on higher ground in case of more flooding, or investing in materials that can guard against fire or wind?
How are your officials mitigating future disasters when it comes to infrastructure improvements?
What are the economic development initiatives that the community is focusing on in order to strengthen the local and regional economy?
How is your community keeping price gouging and fraud down, whether that’s in the housing market, at the grocery store, or for building supplies?

Recovery resources
Recovery is not a prescriptive process, and some of the best advice you’ll find is from other people who have survived disasters. Grist wants to continue adding to this recovery resource, and we encourage you to send workshops, toolkits, links, and stories that have helped you to community@grist.org.

Disasters can feel overwhelming if you’re an immigrant, whether it’s because of your citizenship status, language barriers, or confusion around your rights. It’s important to remember that trusted community networks exist, along with other helpful resources. This guide offers up-to-date information on some of those resources, as well as examples of community organizing and policy work that have made it easier for immigrants to find help. It also includes best practices for navigating disaster relief and recovery at a time when there is a heightened risk of deportation for certain immigrants. This information is fact-checked and will be updated periodically as laws, practices, and resources change.

Finding reliable information
Vetted federal, state, and community resources can help you find accurate, trustworthy information in the event of a disaster.
Dial 211
When you dial 211, you will be referred to the Federal Communications Commission’s free community services directory. This can be a key step in accessing public services. It works similar to 911, where an operator will answer the call and assist you in finding what you need, including services for non-English speakers.
Independent news outlets
News publications that serve non-English speaking individuals often provide emergency resource guides that don’t exist in traditional media. Look for an outlet published in your language in your area. Here are some examples:

El Tímpano in California offers an emergency resource guide in Spanish.
To prepare for this year’s hurricane season, Enlace Latino NC published an article in Spanish on how to obtain free National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, radios through the city of Raleigh, North Carolina. Radio is a primary means of communicating emergency alerts and weather information in the U.S. and can be especially useful during power outages.
Grist published a guide in Spanish and Haitian Creole for Florida farmworkers during the 2024 hurricane season.

Immigrant rights organizations
Across the country, immigrant rights organizations offer an array of services and tips that can be helpful in disaster situations. These are trusted groups who offer support and advocate for change year-round, not just during disasters. Searching online for local organizations that focus specifically on immigrant and labor issues — by typing in the name of your state and the phrases “immigrant rights” or “worker rights” — is a great way to begin looking for support. The tools highlighted below can also inspire other search terms for your own state, like “disaster preparedness toolkit in Spanish,” for example.

The Michigan Immigrant Rights Center has a detailed webpage with a variety of bilingual resources.
The City of Detroit offers a FEMA emergency supply list in Spanish.
In North Carolina, the Episcopal Farmworker Ministry released a video series in Spanish to help immigrant communities and their families prepare for disasters and recuperate in the aftermath. This video explaining how emergency alerts work is applicable to any U.S. state.
In Oregon, the farmworker union Pineros y Campesinos Unidos del Noroeste, or PCUN, made a disaster preparedness toolkit in Spanish available for free on Google Drive.
You can get involved in spreading the word throughout your own community with the help of available, trusted resources. PCUN also offers free social media graphics about the dangers of heat stress and what to do to stay safe at home and on the job.

Many of these organizations also offer legal refreshers for immigrants to understand their rights, which can be impacted by the presence of federal agents at disaster sites. You can read more about that below, under “What to do if you encounter Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE” and “Best practices for staying safe.”
Government services in your language
Federal civil rights law requires any entity receiving federal funding — including virtually all state and local agencies — to provide language access to individuals with limited proficiency in English. And in recent years, an increasing number of local and state government agencies have amped up their language access policies as a result of organizing among community members and immigrant organizations.
In 2023, wildfires spread through the town of Lahaina on the island of Maui, Hawai‘i. In the immediate aftermath, the 30 percent of Lahaina residents with limited proficiency in English had trouble accessing emergency information. Liza Ryan-Gill, the executive director of the Hawai‘i Coalition for Immigrant Rights, spent two days organizing calls with at least 80 community advocates to figure out how to get information to immigrant communities who needed it — in languages they could understand. In 2024, after advocates organized for federal funds to be allocated to local emergency management for language access, Hawai‘i passed HB 2107 and hired a limited English proficiency access coordinator for the state’s emergency management department. Now all emergency resources in the state are translated into at least seven languages.
Other states have taken similar steps: In Michigan, a 2023 law requires translation and interpretation services for languages spoken by individuals with limited English proficiency who comprise at least 3 percent of the population, or 500 individuals, in the region served by a given state agency. New York updated its language access policy in 2022 to cover the 12 most common non-English languages spoken by state residents with limited English proficiency.
While most cities and states do not require agencies to proactively translate documents and resources into specific languages, it is worth checking with your local government and emergency management agencies. If they don’t already provide information in the language you speak, you can request it.
Emergency management agencies: Your city or county has an emergency management department, which is part of the local government.
In Michigan, it’s the Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division.
Emergency managers are responsible for communicating with the public about disasters, managing rescue and response efforts, and coordinating with other agencies. They usually have an SMS-based emergency alert system, so sign up for those texts now. Some cities have multiple languages available, but most emergency alerts are only in English. Many emergency management agencies are active on Facebook, so check there for updates as well.
If you’re having trouble finding your local department, Grist suggests typing your city or county name followed by “emergency management” into Google. You can also search for your state or territory’s emergency management department, which serves a similar function for a larger jurisdiction. Every website looks different, but many of them include translation options at the top or bottom of every page. You can also use Google Translate, or another browser-based automatic language detection program, to automatically translate any webpage.
National Weather Service: This agency, often called NWS, offers information and updates on everything from wildfires to hurricanes to air quality. You can enter your zip code on weather.gov and customize your homepage to get the most updated weather information and receive alerts for a variety of weather conditions. The NWS also sends out localized emergency weather alerts to people’s cell phones via wireless networks, to television and radio stations, and to NOAA Weather Radio, which can receive NWS broadcasts. (Make sure you’ve opted into receiving emergency alerts in your phone settings.) Some local NWS offices automatically translate local alerts into multiple languages — including Chinese, Vietnamese, French, Samoan, and Spanish — in real time.

How federal disaster aid works
The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, is the federal government’s main disaster response agency. It is housed under the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS. Often, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, which is also under DHS, is enlisted to help after a disaster. In 2021, the Biden administration issued guidance designating places where disaster or emergency response and relief are provided as “protected areas” where immigration agents should not engage in enforcement actions. However, in January, the Trump administration rescinded that policy.
Still, experts and immigrant advocates on a national level emphasize that FEMA offers non-financial aid to anyone regardless of immigration status. This includes shelter, emergency supplies, counseling, and other resources. In order to apply for financial aid, someone in your family must be a U.S. citizen; this could be a child. A household should only apply for financial aid once per disaster, according to FEMA guidance. If more than one family member submits an application, it will cause delays in the process.
“The reassurance right now is that nothing has changed in the field,” said Ahmed Gaya, director of the Climate Justice Collaborative at the National Partnership for New Americans, a coalition of 82 state and local immigrant and refugee organizations.
He added that “our communities’ trust in the federal government and trust in FEMA and DHS is at a historic low,” but that the law has not changed and that undocumented folks are still eligible for immediate emergency relief. “There’s a real, credible fear that there is a shift in leadership at DHS, in administration and in the rhetoric. But legal rights remain the same currently.”
As of June 2025, Gaya said, “We have not had reports from the field of FEMA’s practices and policies deviating dramatically from how they have typically gone in regards to dealing with mixed status and undocumented communities.”

What to do if you encounter Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE
“You probably wouldn’t see ICE officers at disaster shelters requesting documents, but we can’t predict how ICE will behave,” says Rich Stolz, a colleague of Gaya who is also a Senior Fellow with Just Solutions, focusing on the intersection of climate justice and immigrant rights strategy and organizing. “The challenge for advocates and emergency groups is making sure that people can make informed decisions. The concern is that people will be under even more stress in a disaster context, and they may forget their rights.”
It can be helpful to have a red card, or tarjeta roja, with you to show to ICE agents in the event of questioning. These cards outline your rights — like the right to remain silent and to talk to a lawyer — and anyone can order them online. They are available through the National Immigration Law Center in Spanish, Arabic, Chinese, Haitian Creole, Korean, Tagalog, and Vietnamese.
There are several “know your rights” guides for immigrants that apply in all situations, not just disasters:

The National Immigration Law Center provides a Know Your Rights guide recommended by legal experts. It is available in Arabic, Chinese, Korean, and Spanish.
The National Immigrant Justice Center offers a guide available in Spanish, Haitian Creole, French, and English that includes laws to know, sample warrants, and helplines.
The National Day Laborer Organizing Network and the National TPS Alliance (an organization for people with temporary protected status) put together an illustrated guide to your rights in English and Spanish. On page 2, you can find step-by-step instructions on what to do if ICE stops you on the street or in a public space.

Best practices for staying safe
Accessing emergency shelter and supplies
You shouldn’t need identification to receive emergency supplies or stay at most emergency shelters, but you may be asked to provide some. Identification may include a photo or non-photo ID; it does not necessarily mean you need to supply a driver’s license, passport, or social security number. Some organizations offer community IDs for those who do not qualify for a state-issued ID. These may not be accepted depending on the county or location.
The Red Cross, which operates shelters after major disasters, says it does not ask for any documentation of legal status when providing aid.

Going to a shelter or government-run site can be intimidating. Here are some other tips gathered from immigrant rights organizations:

Use the buddy system: There is safety in numbers. Go with multiple people to feel more confident in getting the help you need.
Find an English speaker: Someone who speaks English may be able to help you get services if you are worried about language barriers.
Request language interpretation: When talking to police, firefighters, or hospital workers, you have a legal right to an interpreter. Other agencies and institutions may have access to interpreters and translators as well.
Contact an advocacy organization: Farmworker and immigrant advocacy organizations may be able to help you get the supplies and food you need at a safe space.
Talk to your faith community: Speak with your local pastor, members of your place of worship, or someone else you trust about your options.

Support for disaster workers
If you are an immigrant disaster worker, day laborer, or second responder, you have rights and are legally protected by the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA. Day labor worker centers and labor unions are excellent resources if you have any questions regarding safety on the job. The Resilience Force put together easy-to-read illustrated guides in Spanish and English for workers specifically working in disaster recovery.
How to advocate for better resources
Each disaster has ripple effects. That’s why organizations that were not built to deal with disaster relief or response are often taking on that responsibility. “All of us need to figure that out,” said Marisol Jimenez, founder of Tepeyac Consulting, a business based in Asheville, North Carolina, for community organizers around the country. “We’re not disaster organizations, but how do we integrate this into all of our work?”
Here are some of the resources being created to help communities organize for change:

Stolz, Gaya, and their Just Solutions colleagues representing Organizing Resilience, National Partnership for New Americans, National Immigration Law Center, and other groups plan to release a resource guide on disaster response as it relates to the Trump administration’s policies for ICE. A similar rapid response kit was published in 2022.
Researcher Melissa Villarreal at the Natural Hazards Center in Colorado put together an annotated bibliography of academic articles, government reports, and news reports related to emergencies and language access. You can use these examples when advocating for policy change where you live.

Disasters cause communities to spring into action out of necessity, which can result in positive pressure on local governments. The more you can stay connected to your community and trusted local organizations, the more you can create change and better policies that keep immigrants safe and supported.
“So much depends on grassroots organizations actually having a presence and a plan and a strategy,” said Stolz. “A community’s ability to survive and thrive and recover is largely dependent on the existing community cohesion and relationships that exist.”

As the number and ferocity of hurricanes, fires, and other disasters increases, so too does the number of people forced from their homes. Some 3.2 million people were displaced by disasters in 2022, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, and one-third of them could not return home for more than a month.
Losing your home and everything in it, then having to invest time and money to repair and replace everything, is extremely difficult; navigating insurance companies, government agencies, and legal issues is exhausting and nerve-racking. To help you through it, Grist put together a guide to the process for renters and homeowners.

Protecting your belongings and documents
If you live in a region that’s particularly prone to disasters — hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, for example, or fires in the West — you should prepare well in advance. One of the most important things to do is create digital copies of essential documents, and keep physical copies in a weatherproof bag or container.
For homeowners, that means your homeowners insurance policy, the deed to your house, and loan paperwork. Renters, keep copies of your lease agreement and renters insurance policy if you have one. These documents will help establish your ownership or residency at the time of a disaster. (If you don’t have a written lease, a verbal contract may hold up, but try to find documentation supporting the agreement — a text, email, etc.)
Keeping copies of other helpful files, such as a recent tax return and bank statements, as well as government-issued IDs, Social Security cards, immigration records, and anything else that provides your address is a good idea. Pay stubs can help prove your income if you apply for FEMA aid.

Lastly, consider keeping photos of your home and big ticket items, such as appliances, TVs, stereos, or laptops — and write down serial numbers — so that you can prove what they looked like before the disaster. Government agencies or insurance companies will likely ask for proof that specific damage, like a collapsed roof, isn’t the result of deferred maintenance or a previous disaster.
All of this administrative setup can save a lot of hassle in a crisis. When Hurricane Harvey caused $125 billion in damages in Southeast Texas in 2017, more than a quarter of all FEMA applicants were denied aid; common reasons included that people couldn’t prove homeownership or failed to provide valid identification. In 2020, survivors of the Almeda wildfires in Oregon faced similar hurdles: FEMA denied 57 percent of all applications. Mobile or manufactured homeowners in particular had a hard time proving ownership and residency.
If you live in a mobile or manufactured home, be sure that you have a safe place to go in case of severe weather — especially tornadoes. Here are some helpful tips from the National Weather Service to stay safe. To prepare for hurricanes or other high-wind storms, consider reinforcing your roof, anchoring your foundation, and reinforcing doors.
Are you a renter? Know your rights
Nearly 35 percent of households in the U.S. rent their home, and they are especially vulnerable to the impacts of disasters. They have more limited access to recovery funding from federal aid or insurance, and almost no control over the process of rebuilding their damaged home, since they don’t own the property. Renters insurance primarily covers the cost of personal belongings that are damaged during a disaster; some policies may include reimbursements for hotels or temporary living situations.
Finding new housing after a disaster can be difficult because rents often skyrocket after a disaster, and there are fewer undamaged properties available on the market. While homeowners can request a mortgage payment deferral, landlords often won’t make the same concession. The National Low Income Housing Coalition reports that rents typically rise between 4 to 6 percent annually for about three years after a major disaster.
In Los Angeles, some units that escaped the Palisades Fire were relisted for three times as much despite a California law capping such increases to 10 percent after a disaster declaration. The organization also found that renters were more likely to be displaced than homeowners, and for longer stretches of time. Evictions also rise in the two years following a disaster.
Renters’ rights and protections vary by state. Some allow tenants to withhold payment until repairs are made; others say nonpayment for that reason could be grounds for eviction. Either way, you may be entitled to certain protections, such as reimbursement for simple repairs you make yourself, through your lease.
A list of Michigan-specific legal resources can be found here.
Here are some tips:

Get it all down in writing. The Legal Aid Disaster Resource Center recommends documenting any conversations you have with your landlord about damages and repairs. This will provide proof of any agreements regarding specific damages, costs, and other details. This can help if you must go to court to break a lease due to unsafe conditions.
Understand the legal process. Your landlord cannot evict you without filing a legal complaint, and in some states they must provide written warning before taking that step. If you have not terminated or violated your lease, your landlord cannot legally change the locks, shut off the utilities, or remove your property without going through the legal process of eviction — even if you were evacuated or forced from your home. This is important to know because landlords sometimes evict tenants after a disaster to renovate buildings and increase rents. If your landlord attempts to wrongfully evict you, consult a lawyer or a pro bono legal aid organization.
Disaster Legal Services, funded by FEMA, works with state bar associations and pro bono lawyers to set up hotlines for legal services following a federally declared disaster. (Call 1-800-621-3362.) However, as of March 2025, parts of that program are suspended after the Trump administration froze some FEMA funding. You can also find free or affordable legal services through other avenues, like typing “legal aid society” and your location into a search engine, or checking with trusted people and organizations in your community.
Know how federal aid works. Tenants who are displaced or evicted after a disaster are eligible for help from FEMA. You might receive direct assistance to pay rent, or reimbursement for staying at a hotel. The agency may also provide temporary housing until your home is habitable again. After a series of disasters hit Lake Charles, Louisiana, between 2020 and 2021, some residents lived in FEMA trailers for over a year as they searched for an affordable place to live.

Some other resources for renters’ rights:

The National Low Income Housing Coalition has a host of resources, including how disasters impact federally assisted housing, specific housing needs by state, and a guide on eviction processes.
Your local health department, city or county government, or legal aid organization will likely have a webpage dedicated to renters’ rights. Michigan’s Office of Attorney General maintain a webpage of resources here.
The Stanford Legal Design Lab and Charitable Trusts has a database where you can find local legal rules about housing, eviction, rent, and landlord-tenant issues, and groups and guides that can help you with housing assistance.

How to navigate government aid, donations, and insurance
Homeowners facing costly repairs after a natural disaster have options for aid. Insurance policies may cover some or all of the damages. Federal agencies like HUD, FEMA, and the Small Business Administration will provide funding as well. Some people turn to their own savings, mutual aid groups that raise money and distribute it directly, or crowdfunding platforms to help cover costs.
Insurance: Homeowners should first file a claim with their insurance company. Based on what your policy covers and your insurer pays, you can then apply for other types of federal aid. It’s important to keep good records and itemize your costs and reimbursements. You can receive payouts from a combination of private and public aid, but be careful of double-dipping: If you will receive funds from one source for specific damage, government aid can’t be used to cover the same costs.
The legal term for this is “duplication of benefits.” Let’s say your insurance paid to replace your roof, but not the cost of removing mold in your walls. You cannot legally receive additional money for the damage to your roof, but you can apply for help covering the cost of mold removal or other damage not covered by your insurance policy.
Federal/state aid: To receive assistance from federal or state agencies, you must submit an application to the agency. This can usually be done online, and you may be able to apply in person or over the phone. There is a specific process cities, states, and tribal governments must navigate in order for residents to receive FEMA aid. If you are a U.S. citizen, or meet certain qualifications as a non-citizen, and live in a disaster declaration area that was approved by FEMA and the president, you are eligible to apply for aid immediately after they announce it. You can apply on disasterassistance.gov, through the FEMA app, or at a FEMA recovery center. FEMA offers survivors eligible for individual assistance:

A one-time grant of $750 for emergency needs and essential items like food, baby items, and medication
Temporary housing assistance equivalent to 14 nights in a hotel in your area
Up to 18 months of rental assistance
Payments for lost property that isn’t covered by your homeowners or renters insurance
Other forms of assistance, depending on your needs and losses

You can track the status of your aid application via the app or disasterassistance.gov and receive notifications if FEMA needs more information from you.
You will need to provide proof of your identity and residency and document the damages that your home sustained. A FEMA inspector will meet you at your home to determine the damages. If your application is approved, you will receive funds or a loan approval with details on which repairs are covered.
You may also qualify for rental assistance from FEMA. You must apply for individual disaster assistance to be considered for rental assistance. These funds can be used for rent, including a security deposit, and utilities such as electricity and water, at a house, apartment, hotel, or recreational vehicle that is not your damaged home. Residents in counties with a federal disaster declaration are eligible to apply under FEMA’s Individuals and Households Program. The rate is set by an area’s Fair Market Rent; find yours here.
Read more: Everything you need to know when applying for individual and rental assistance from FEMA
If your application is denied, you have the right to appeal the decision within 60 days. You should include any information that was missing from your initial application, as well as supporting documents showing costs, damages, and proof of residence and ownership of your home. Lawyers and community advocates can help you write the appeal. You will need to sign the letter, along with a statement verifying that you authorized someone else to write the appeal. FEMA has 90 days to review your appeal, but delays are possible given the volume of paperwork the agency may be reviewing.
Some homeowners may also apply for help through the Small Business Administration’s program, which provides low-interest loans for repairs. You don’t have to own a business to apply, and FEMA may refer you to SBA’s application to check if you qualify for additional aid for funds to make your home more resilient to future disasters.
Mortgage, rent, and utility relief: Homeowners may qualify for mortgage relief. Providers aren’t legally required to offer assistance, but they can waive late fees, delay foreclosures, and provide forbearance. It is usually up to the homeowner to initiate a conversation about these options.
If you have a loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration, you have more legal protections. If you’re unable to make payments, your mortgage servicer cannot initiate a foreclosure for 90 days after a presidentially declared disaster in your area, and you can negotiate a repayment plan or modify some terms of your loan. You may also be able to meet with HUD-approved counselors trained in foreclosure prevention, who can help you evaluate your options and finances.
Both renters and homeowners may qualify for rental and utility assistance from government agencies and nonprofit organizations. If your home or rental unit is uninhabitable or you cannot stay there for another reason, there are likely organizations providing assistance with finding a place to live. Be on the lookout for applications for these in the days and weeks after a disaster. (If you’re not sure where to start looking, here are some examples of types of organizations that provided these services after Helene in 2024; they included local nonprofits, churches, housing organizations, county governments, and more.)
Crowdfunding/GoFundMe: Some disaster survivors turn to crowdfunding platforms to cover costs for evacuations, funerals, or repairs. According to data from GoFundMe, one of the largest platforms, disaster recovery campaigns in the U.S. raised over $100 million in 2023. This avenue is often faster than waiting on insurance claims and FEMA applications. Donations you receive are considered gifts, and you will not be required to pay taxes on them, as long as you don’t promise donors goods or services in exchange. However, you can’t apply for other sources of aid to cover the same expenses you list in the campaign you create.

How to avoid fraud and scams
There’s always the risk of fraud as con artists posting as government officials or unscrupulous contractors try to bilk people out of their money or rip them off with shoddy work. A few tips can minimize the risk.

Verify the identity of anyone who approaches you unsolicited with offers of help. Ask for identification. FEMA employees, housing inspectors, and other government officials carry official IDs. A government uniform is not proof of identification.
Government officials will not ask you for money or for financial information. Do not trust anyone who seeks payment up front or promises a loan or grant.
Work with reputable contractors and check their credentials and licenses before hiring them (more on this below). Here are some tips from the National Insurance Crime Bureau to avoid getting taken.
Ask for written quotes and contracts throughout the process.

If you have knowledge of fraud, waste, or abuse, you can report it to the FEMA Disaster Fraud Hotline at 866-720-5721 or email StopFEMAFraud@fema.dhs.gov. You also can contact the National Center for Disaster Fraud. Before calling, gather as many details as possible, including how and where it occurred. You can also report it to your state’s attorney general or local law enforcement.
Be wary of disaster investors: You may receive calls, texts, or other communications pressuring you to sell your home as-is, for cash. These “disaster investors” take advantage of the stress and uncertainty that people feel as they return to damaged homes. Their offers often target individuals who will have a difficult path to recovery, including low-income homeowners and the elderly.
Investors trying to scoop up properties to flip after a disaster will often make offers that are lower than market value, even with the damage your home might have sustained. If you are interested in selling, work with a trusted real estate agent of your choosing, and check what comparable homes should sell for in your area. Never sign any agreements or contracts about a potential sale without carefully reviewing them — no matter how much you’re pressured to sign on the spot.
Choose a contractor carefully: You’ll likely need to hire a contractor to do major repairs, and it’s important to vet any offers to fix up your home. Here are some tips for avoiding scams from the Michigan Office of Attorney General’s Consumer Protection Division:
To avoid falling victim to con artists who travel to disaster sites in order to take advantage of homeowners desperate to return to “normal”, make sure you take the following steps:

Breathe! Take some time to absorb what has happened, and don’t make any rash decisions before doing your homework. This is especially true if you are approached by anyone telling you they can fix your home right away – but only if you accept their “help” right now. Legitimate home repair contractors understand that you need time to do your homework and check them out before you pay them anything or sign any contracts.
Talk to your homeowner’s insurance agent or company. Carefully review your homeowner’s insurance policy to determine what damage may be covered and the amount of your deductible. Then be sure to contact your homeowner’s insurance agent or company, writing down questions you have and the answers that you are provided, along with a list of whom you talked to and when. Knowing what your insurance will cover will help you to determine how much you are able to spend on repairs, and prioritize repairs based on safety and need.
Do your homework. Do your homework before hiring a home repair contractor by following the tips found in the remainder of this Consumer Alert.  Some of our tips include ensuring that the home repair contractor that you’ve decided to hire is licensed, insured, well-regarded by your friends and neighbors, and you are comfortable with their complaint history (if one exists).
Get everything in writing, never pay in cash, and never pay in full up front. Ensure that all promises, quotes, and expectations are put in writing in a contract that you will carefully review before signing! After you’ve carefully reviewed and signed a home repair contract, never pay for home repairs in cash! Paying for a home repair using a credit card is recommended, because using credit cards provides you with added protection to dispute a charge if the repair is not completed. Finally, you should never pay for an entire home repair up front! To ensure that all work is completed in accordance with the contract terms and your expectations, arrange to pay for only part of the work (generally one-third of the total contract price should suffice) up front and pay for the rest of the work once it is complete to your satisfaction.You can also check with the Better Business Bureau for any history of complaints: 1-800-544-7693 or online as well as look at reviews on sites such as Yelp, Google, or Angie’s List.

Building a new home or repairing your home
As you make repairs or reconstruct your home, you may be able to use insurance payouts and other assistance to make the place more resilient. (If you’re interested in learning more about rebuilding after disasters, read this report from Ohio River Valley Institute about housing damage from the 2022 Kentucky floods.)
Consider installing more energy-efficient features, including new insulation, double-paned windows, and hurricane shutters. If you’re in a flood zone, you may want to elevate outdoor components of your HVAC system so that they don’t flood in the future. If you live in a tornado-prone area, you could add or retrofit a room to serve as a storm shelter. Materials like stucco can help fire-proof your home more than wood or vinyl siding. Some communities can qualify for the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, a federally funded program managed by local government agencies, that aims to help homeowners with structural elevation, reinforcing buildings to withstand natural disasters, and buyouts by FEMA. The land is deeded to the local county for parks, greenways, and other municipal projects.
In some flood cases, you may be required to elevate your home to avoid future damages. This is typically the case if you participate in the National Flood Insurance Program or if your community has or adopts stricter floodplain management. After receiving FEMA aid, you could be required to purchase a flood insurance policy.
After clearing out debris, consider planting native grasses, shrubs, and trees that suit your local ecology. This can help prevent soil erosion and improve drainage, which might help reduce water in your home during major rainstorms, particularly in basements. Some native species may be drought-tolerant and somewhat fire-resistant, as well. Opting for pea gravel or stones to fill out your landscaping instead of Bermuda grass can help reduce the risks of fire spreading over your lawn. Make sure that you create a buffer zone between your house and landscaping; additionally, pruning and clearing fallen branches and leaves can help reduce future risks.

In the weeks leading up to the 2024 presidential election, Hurricane Helene made landfall, causing extensive damage and flooding from northwest Florida to inland areas of Tennessee and North Carolina. Then Hurricane Milton hit central Florida a couple of weeks later. Polling sites across the region had to be moved at the last minute, and misinformation around voting in the affected areas swelled online.
Surviving a severe storm, wildfire, or other extreme weather event is an experience that many Americans have had, or will have in the future, as climate change increases the frequency and intensity of natural disasters. According to 2024 polling from the Pew Research Center, 7 in 10 Americans said their community experienced an extreme weather event in the past 12 months, including flooding, drought, extreme heat, rising sea levels, or major wildfires.
The aftermath of a disaster can be terrifying and traumatic, and many survivors struggle to secure basic necessities such as food and shelter, or to fill out paperwork for disaster aid and insurance. Finding accurate information about where and how to vote is even harder — so hard, in fact, that many people who have experienced disasters don’t bother to vote at all. With experts forecasting active hurricane and wildfire seasons, it’s more important than ever to be prepared for disruptions to the voting process for any primaries and special elections, as well as Election Day in November.
The guide below aims to help you navigate early and absentee voting, as well as what to expect on Election Day, should a disaster affect your area. (If you’re not registered to vote, find your state’s voter registration rules below.)

In-person voting
If a disaster strikes, the governor can extend voting deadlines, allow ballots to be forwarded to a new address, allow local officials to change or add new polling places, or postpone municipal elections. Those rules are different depending on the state, and information may be hard to find in the wake of a disaster.
The U.S. Vote Foundation has a tool to access your county election office’s contact information, which typically includes county clerks, supervisors, auditors, boards of elections, or election commissions, depending on the state. You can try to contact these offices, but it’s not guaranteed they’ll be able to answer your questions. You can also ask voting rights groups in your area and watch local news for any changes or updates.
In the wake of a disaster, first confirm where you should be voting. Has your polling place been damaged or moved? If multiple locations are combined into one, or Election Day volunteers are scarce post-disaster, be prepared to stand in long lines to vote. If you’re waiting in the heat, make sure to bring water and wear comfortable shoes and appropriate clothing. (Twenty-one states prohibit campaign apparel, so keep that in mind.) Here are some other resources on heat waves.
Was your car damaged in a disaster? Need a ride to the polls? Some ride-share services and public transit systems offer free rides on Election Day. Here’s more information.

Early voting
Most states, including Michigan, as well as Washington, D.C., Puerto Rico, Guam, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, offer some form of early voting, which is voting in person before the election anywhere from a few days to more than a month early, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. However, the hours, locations, and timing differ for each. Three states — Alabama, Mississippi, and New Hampshire — do not allow early in-person voting.
Early in-person voting is a useful option if you’d like to avoid lines on Election Day or will be out of town. It’s also an option for people who live in a region of the country prone to natural disasters or have been recently hit by one. In-person voting on Election Day, which comes at the tail end of “danger season,” may not either be a possibility or priority. Go here to see the specific rules around early voting in your state.
Absentee ballots
Absentee voting is often called “mail-in voting” or “by-mail voting.” Every state offers this, but some require you to meet certain conditions, like having a valid excuse for why you can’t make it to the polls on Election Day. Absentee voting can be a particularly useful tool for people recently displaced by extreme weather, or are at risk of being displaced. It also safeguards voters who live in the hottest parts of the country, where heat can make waiting in long lines dangerous.
The League of Women Voters explains absentee voting rules by state here. If you reside in a county that gets a federal disaster declaration after a disaster hits, there may be changes to these processes that can offer you more time and flexibility.
Voter ID laws
Each state has a different voter ID law: Some require photo identification, others require a document such as a utility bill, bank statement, or paycheck, while still others require a signature. The National Conference of State Legislatures has a breakdown of the rules here.
If your ID gets destroyed in a flood, fire, or tornado, your state may be able to exempt you from showing an ID at the polls. For instance, after Hurricane Harvey in 2017, Texas residents who lost their ID to floodwaters could vote without one once they filled out an affidavit stating that their identification was lost because of a natural disaster. Your state may also waive the fees associated with getting a new ID.
The best way to find this information is to contact your county clerk or other election official, or contact a voting rights group in your area.
Know your rights
Just as there are strict rules in states around how people can cast ballots, there are also many others that dictate what happens outside of polling places. In most states, you can accept water and food from groups around polling places — but there is misinformation around doing so. For example, after the 2020 presidential election, Georgia passed a law prohibiting this activity within a certain buffer zone, only for a judge to later strike down part of it. So while there is no longer a ban on handing things to voters within 25 feet of the line to vote, it is still illegal to do so within 150 feet of the building where ballots are being cast.
Call or text 866-OUR-VOTE (866-687-8683) to report voter intimidation to the Election Protection Coalition. You can also find more information on voter rights from the ACLU.

Ideally, you’d have weeks or days to prepare for an extreme weather. But the reality is, especially with floods, wildfires, and tornadoes, things change quickly. That’s why it’s critical to plan in advance to know where you will get reliable information, prepare an evacuation plan, and have all the materials that you may need if you lose power, your home is damaged, or you’re waiting for help.
Here’s a toolkit to help you get started.

Where to find accurate information
Many people find out about disasters in their area via social media. But it’s important to make sure the information you’re receiving is correct. Below is a list of reliable sources to check for emergency alerts, updates, and more.
Your local emergency manager: Your city or county has an emergency management department, which is part of the local government. Emergency managers are responsible for communicating with the public about disasters, managing rescue and response efforts, and coordinating between different agencies. They usually have an SMS-based emergency alert system, so sign up for those texts now. (Note: Some cities have multiple languages available, but most emergency alerts are only in English.) Many emergency management agencies are active on Facebook, so check there for updates as well.
If you’re having trouble finding your local department, you can search the State of Michigan’s Emergency Management and Homeland Security Division web page for your region’s district director. We also suggest typing your city or county name followed by “emergency management” into Google. In larger cities, it’s often a separate agency; in smaller communities, fire chiefs or sheriff’s offices may manage emergency response and alerts.
National Weather Service: This agency, called NWS, is part of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA, and offers information and updates on everything from wildfires to hurricanes to air quality. You can enter your zip code on weather.gov and customize your homepage to get the most updated weather information and receive alerts for a variety of weather conditions. The NWS also has regional and local branches where you can sign up for SMS alerts. Local alerts in multiple languages are available in some areas.
If you’re in a rural area or somewhere that isn’t highlighted on the agency’s maps, keep an eye out for local alerts and evacuation orders. NWS may not have as much information ahead of time in these areas because there often aren’t as many weather monitoring stations.
Watch vs. warning: You’ll often see meteorologists refer to storm or fire watches or warnings. If there is a “watch,” that means the conditions are ripe for extreme weather. A wildfire watch means “critical fire weather conditions are possible but not imminent or occurring,” according to NOAA. A warning, however, means the threat is more imminent and you should be prepared to take shelter or evacuate if told to. For instance, a wildfire warning is set when fire conditions are “ongoing or expected to occur shortly.”
You can track extreme weather via these websites:

The National Interagency Fire Center tracks wildfires around the country.
This ArcGIS fire tracker uses government data to pinpoint fire activity across the country.
The National Hurricane Center tracks hurricanes in the Central Pacific, Eastern Pacific, and Atlantic Oceans.
The National Weather Service active alerts page monitors severe weather by state, region, and type.

Local news: The local television news and social media accounts from verified news sources will have live updates during and after a storm. Meteorologists on your local news station use NWS weather data. Follow your local newspaper and television station on Facebook or other social media, or check their websites regularly. If you don’t have cable, these stations often livestream online for free during severe weather.
Weather stations and apps: The Weather Channel, Accuweather, Apple Weather, and Google, which all rely on NWS weather data, will have information on major storms. That may not be the case for smaller-scale weather events, and you shouldn’t rely on these apps to tell you if you need to evacuate or move to higher ground. Instead, check your local news broadcast on television or radio, or check NWS.

How to pack an emergency kit
As you prepare for a disaster, it’s important to have an emergency kit ready in case you lose power or need to leave your home. Review this checklist from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for what to pack so you can stay safe, hydrated, and healthy. (FEMA has these resources available in multiple languages here.)
The State of Michigan also has disaster preparedness webpage.
These can often be expensive to create, so contact your local disaster aid organizations, houses of worship, or charities to see if there are free or affordable kits available — or buy one or two items every time you’re at the grocery store. Ideally, this will be packed well in advance of hurricane or fire season, so gather as much as you can ahead of time in case shelves are empty when a storm is on the way.
FEMA has activities for kids to make this process more fun; the ASPCA also has useful guidelines for people with pets.
Here are some of the most important things to have in your kit:

A list of phone numbers for your city or county emergency services, police departments, local hospitals, and health departments
Water (one gallon per person per day for several days)
Food (at least a several-day supply of non-perishable food) and a can opener
Medicines and documentation of your medical needs
Identification and proof of residency documents (see a more detailed list below)
A flashlight
A battery-powered or hand crank radio
Backup batteries
Blanket(s) and sleeping bags
Change of clothes and closed-toed shoes
First aid kit (The Red Cross has a list of what to include)
N-95 masks, hand sanitizer, and trash bags
Wrench or pliers
Cell phone with chargers and a backup battery
If you have babies or children: diapers, wipes, and food or formula
If you have pets: food, collar, leash, and any medicines needed

Wirecutter, Wired, Popular Mechanics, and some other news outlets have “best of” lists for many of these items, where you can find different price points and features. You can also find reviews on Consumer Reports.
Don’t forget: Documents
One of the most important things to have in your emergency kit is documents you may need to prove your residence, demonstrate extent of damage, and to vote. FEMA often requires you to provide these documents in order to receive financial assistance after a disaster. Keep these items in a water- and fire-proof folder or container. You can find more details about why you may need these documents here.

Government-issued ID, such as a drivers’ license, for each member of your household
Proof of citizenship or legal residency for each member of your household (passport, green card, etc.)
Social Security card for each member of your household
Documentation of your medical needs, including medications or special equipment (oxygen tanks, wheelchairs, etc.)
Health insurance card
Car title and registration documents
Pre-disaster photos of the inside and outside of your house and belongings
For homeowners: copies of your deed, mortgage information, and home insurance policy, if applicable
For homeowners: copies of your deed, mortgage information, and flood insurance policy, if applicable
For renters: a copy of your lease and renters insurance policy
Financial documents such as a checkbook or voided check

Planning for people with disabilities
Disabled people have a right to all disaster alerts in a format that is accessible. The Partnership for Inclusive Disaster Strategies, a disability-led nonprofit focused on disasters, has a list of these rights. The organization also runs a hotline for any questions: (800) 626-4959 or hotline@disasterstrategies.org.
FEMA has a list of specific planning steps for people with disabilities. Some of these recommendations include:

Contact your local emergency management office to ask about voluntary registries for people with disabilities to self-identify so they can access targeted assistance during emergencies and disasters.
If you use medical equipment that requires electricity, ask your health care provider about what you may be able to do to keep it running during a power outage.
Wear medical alert tags or bracelets. Also add pertinent medical information to your electronic devices.
In your emergency kit, have your prescription information and medicines, as well as contact information for people who can help care for you or answer questions.

Power outage safety
You may experience a power outage before or during a disaster. Here are some ways to stay safe:

Your utility company may alert you of changes, so sign up for texts, emails, or calls from them.
If your power does go out, keep your refrigerator closed as much as possible and eat perishable food first. Get some coolers with ice if possible, and if you’re in doubt about any food, throw it out.
Unplug appliances and electronics you don’t need, and use flashlights instead of candles to reduce the risk of fire.
Do not use a gas stove to heat your home and do not use outdoor stoves inside. If you have a generator, keep it outside in a well ventilated area away from windows. The Red Cross has more generator safety tips.

Planning an evacuation route
It is important to have a plan in case there’s an evacuation order in your area, or if you decide you want to evacuate on your own. FEMA has a list of key things to know when making an evacuation plan.

Choose several places you could go in an emergency — maybe a friend or family member’s house in another city, or a hotel. Choose destinations in different directions so you have options. If you have pets, make sure the place you choose allows them, as shelters usually only allow service animals.
Make sure you know several routes and other means of transportation out of your area, in case roads are closed.
Keep a full tank of gas in your car if you know a disaster may be coming, and keep your emergency kit in your car or in an easily accessible place.
Come up with a plan to stay in touch with members of your household in case you are separated. Check with your neighbors as well.
Unplug electrical equipment, except for freezers and refrigerators, before you evacuate. If there’s already damage to your home in any way, shut off water, gas, and electricity.

Always heed the advice of local officials when it comes to evacuations. Your state or county may have specific routes and plans in case there are mandatory evacuations. For instance, Florida’s emergency management division has designated zones and routes across the state for hurricane evacuations. Los Angeles County has resources for different evacuation scenarios in case of wildfire.
Protecting and preparing your home
It’s impossible to know what might happen to your home during a disaster, but there are many best practices to keep your belongings and property as safe as possible.
The list below contains tips from several sources, including FEMA and the National Fire Protection Association, for protecting your home from wildfire.

Equip an outdoor water source with a hose that can reach any area of your property.
Create a fire-resistant zone that is free of leaves, debris, or flammable materials for at least 30 feet from your home.
Clean roofs and gutters of dead leaves, debris, and pine needles.
Clean debris from exterior attic vents and install ⅛-inch metal mesh screening to block embers.
Move any flammable material, including mulch, flammable plants, leaves, pine needles, and firewood piles, away from walls. Remove anything stored underneath decks or porches.
Designate a room that can be closed off from outside air. Close all doors and windows. Set up a portable air cleaner to keep indoor pollution levels low when smoky conditions exist.
Use fire-resistant materials to build, renovate, or make repairs.

Below is a list of ways to protect your home from water and wind damage, gathered from the National Flood Insurance Program and local government sources.

Move your most valued belongings to a high, safe place, such as an attic.
Clear your gutters and downspouts when you know a big rain is coming, and make sure they’re pointed downhill, away from your home.
Clear storm drains and drainage ditches of debris.
Elevate your utilities, including electrical panels, propane tanks, sockets, wiring, appliances, and heating systems, if possible, and anchor them in place.
Get a sump pump if you are a homeowner. A working sump pump and a water alarm can minimize flood damage in your basement. Install a battery-operated backup pump in case the power goes out.
Get a sump pump if you are a homeowner. A working sump pump and a water alarm can minimize flood damage in your basement. Install a battery-operated backup pump in case the power goes out.
Seal any cracks in your foundation with mortar, caulk, or hydraulic cement.
Secure outdoor items so they don’t blow or wash away.
If you’re in a hurricane-prone area, install storm shutters. There are many products for every budget; some are temporary and some are permanent.
Secure loose roof shingles, which can create a domino effect if wind starts to take them off.

The list below contains tips from several sources, including FEMA and the U.S. Energy Department, on protecting your home from frigid temperatures.

Clear debris and tree limbs, especially those hanging over your gutters or roof in case ice, wind, or snow knocks them down.
Protect your pipes from cracking by detaching garden hoses before freezing weather begins. Leave your faucet dripping and open the cabinet doors under your sinks.

Evaluate the insulation in your home. If you’re a renter and can’t do much to your space, there are affordable options like sealing gaps around windows with plastic or weather stripping, getting heavy curtains, and installing door sweeps or putting towels along the bottom of doors. If you’re a homeowner, you can do more permanent things like insulating floors, ducts, and attics, or caulking around windows and doors.

The list below contains tips from several sources, including FEMA and the American Lung Association, on protecting your home during heat waves.

An affordable way to block sunlight from your windows is with blackout curtains or blinds. If you can install awnings or shutters, that can also help.
If you’re a homeowner, you can invest in more energy-efficient appliances or install cool roofing.
Don’t use heat-producing appliances on hot days. Dry your clothes outside instead of in the dryer, and microwave food to reduce oven use.
Make sure your air filters are changed every six months, or even more frequently, to ensure your air conditioning works properly.
Get some desk fans and box fans to circulate air.

Having enough food and water on hand when a disaster strikes is critical, but it’s not all there is to preparing for an emergency. It’s important to know where to go for free fresh or hot food, clean water, and other essentials once it’s safe to venture from wherever you may be sheltering, and knowing the food programs you may qualify for locally and federally that could help you afford food in the weeks and months after a disaster.
We’ve compiled a guide to food safety and access based on recommendations from physicians, health departments, emergency management departments, and federal agencies including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, and the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA.

Preparing your food supplies at home
As you prepare for an extreme weather event, it’s important to have enough food ready and easily transportable in case you lose power or need to evacuate. Review this checklist from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, for what to pack so you can stay safe, hydrated, and healthy.
Read more: How to pack an emergency kit and prepare your home
State and county emergency-management departments offer varying guidelines on how to best prepare food supplies for a disaster. For instance, some counties in Florida suggest residents stock up enough food to last them at least two weeks in case of an emergency, while the State of Michigan suggests at least three days.
It’s becoming increasingly expensive to buy everything for an emergency stockpile all at once. A more affordable strategy is to pick up one or two items every time you go to the grocery store, well in advance of hurricane or wildfire season, and build up your emergency food stockpile over time. You can also contact your local disaster aid organizations, houses of worship, or charities to see if there are free or affordable nonperishable goods available.
Some of the most important things to have:

Water (at least one gallon per person and pet in the household per day for several days)
Food (at least a three day supply of nonperishable food for every person and pet in a household)
Common kitchen tools like scissors, a knife, a can opener, and a cooking thermometer

Here are some food-safety tips during and after a disaster:

If you plan to take shelter away from home, it’s always best to prepare for the likelihood that the power will go out, spoiling refrigerated and frozen food. Be wary about eating food that may have gone bad, and when in doubt, throw it out.
Buy food with the lowest safety risks. This includes canned food with high liquid content and with limited salt, as salty foods will make you thirsty.

If the power goes out and you’re home, take the following steps to ensure your food will remain safe to eat:

Keep the refrigerator and freezer doors closed as much as possible. An unopened refrigerator can maintain its temperature for only roughly four hours, while a freezer can stay cold for approximately 48 hours.
Pack refrigerated and freezer items tightly together to help retain cold temperatures for longer. (This should not be done with ready-to-eat foods or anything raw, such as poultry or fish.)
Freeze containers of water to use for ice and potentially drinking water.
If the power outage lasts for more than two hours, or if the refrigerator or freezer temperature rises above 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the FDA recommends that you discard any perishable food. Your appliance may tell you the temperature inside. If it doesn’t have that feature, keep an appliance thermometer handy. You can also use a bulb or candy thermometer by placing it directly into a container of food or liquid that has been in the refrigerator or freezer for 24 hours.

If there is flooding, avoid eating any food that may have come into contact with floodwater, and get rid of any foods or beverages that are not in a waterproof container or have damaged packaging. If food is not damaged or wet, follow these in-depth instructions from the FDA to make sure it’s safe to eat.
Storing food properly can help give it a longer shelf life and protect it from water damage. Here are some tips:

Store items in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight.
Place your food supply on high shelves to keep them far from any household flooding.
If possible, swap foods in paper boxes or cartons into airtight or waterproof containers to keep out pests.
Be sure to verify expiration dates on canned and dry goods.
Store all fresh food away from ranges or refrigerator exhausts. Heat causes many foods to spoil faster.

Accessing food during and after a disaster
Where to find community-led resources on food access
Local nonprofits, food banks, food and agricultural hubs, houses of worship, and schools are all crucial frontline resources in the aftermath of a disaster, providing food and water for people regardless of socioeconomic or immigration status. Before a storm or wildfire hits your area, you can look up where organizations such as these may be in your community. During a disaster, they may offer hot meals and fresh produce, as well as nonperishables.
Recent federal funding cuts have left food banks and charitable food organizations across the country without as much money for direct food assistance, so check with your local food bank to make sure they are running these programs.
Most cities and counties will have a list of sites that are supplying food and water. You can call or check their websites. Also check your local news — either radio, online, or on television — for options.
National and international charitable organizations often deploy on-the-ground teams to distribute free food to areas hit by major disaster events. Typically these groups prioritize places where the scope of damage and population impact is significant. This list of organizations is by no means exhaustive:

World Central Kitchen
American Red Cross
Feeding America
The Salvation Army
Team Rubicon
Americares
United Way
Catholic Charities

Your state and county emergency-management departments, government-operated emergency shelters, as well as your city, tribe, or territory, is likely to partner with the school district, food banks, first responders, and federal agencies to set up ad hoc food and water distribution centers in the immediate days following a disaster event. Each entity’s official website and social media pages are great resources for up-to-date information on these efforts.
FEMA Disaster Recovery Centers also tend to serve as a source of food and water after a storm or other disaster.
Read more: How FEMA aid works
Applying for longer-term food relief programs
Depending on your legal status, total household income, and whether your household includes children under 5 years old or a pregnant or breastfeeding mother, you could be eligible for government benefits that include financial assistance for food. Keep in mind that these programs require a lengthy application process, and often have a waiting list long before a disaster strikes. Some of them are also being cut or changed by the Trump administration, so contact the local or state office to find out more.
SNAP: The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, provides food assistance to low-income families to supplement their grocery budgets for foods to prepare at home. In the event of a disaster, you may be able to buy hot or premade food using SNAP dollars. This is not intended for immediate relief, as it could take time to apply and begin receiving any benefits. To apply, you must first contact your local or state SNAP office. Applications are handled differently depending on the state in which you live; some can be submitted online, while others need to be done in person or by mail.
The Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or D-SNAP, also known as disaster food stamps, helps you pay for food if you live in a county with a federal disaster declaration. D-SNAP provides funds on an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card to pay for food. Even if you do not normally receive or qualify for food assistance through SNAP benefits, you may qualify if you live in a county that has received a federal disaster declaration. This benefit usually amounts to at least a month of the maximum SNAP allotment for low-income households. This is not immediate relief, as it could take time to apply and receive the benefits.
If you’re a SNAP recipient, get benefits that are less than the monthly maximum, and have losses from the disaster, you can request a supplement under D-SNAP. Existing SNAP recipients may also request replacement benefits for food that was bought with SNAP dollars and lost in the disaster.
Be on the lookout for more information about this program through your local news, community organizations, or local SNAP office.
WIC: The Women, Infants, and Children program offers food assistance, information, and health care referrals to low-income families with children under age 5 or those expecting a new child. You can be eligible for WIC with any immigration status. To apply, you will need to contact  your local WIC office to schedule an appointment, where your eligibility will be determined.
TEFAP: The Emergency Food Assistance Program helps supplement the diets of lower-income people by providing emergency food assistance at no cost. TEFAP is distinct from SNAP as it provides actual food, not money, to those in need, distributed through local food banks and pantries. When the president makes a major disaster declaration, affected states are given the opportunity to reallocate and distribute existing TEFAP food and funding inventories to disaster relief organizations. You cannot apply directly for TEFAP foods, but may be able to get TEFAP foods to take home from a local soup kitchen or food pantry based on your income level.
How to navigate food distribution if you’re not a U.S. citizen
Most of the above federal nutrition programs are not accessible to anyone who is not a U.S. citizen or what the government deems a “qualified immigrant.” Though undocumented immigrants have long been largely ineligible for federal public benefits, there have been some exceptions for emergency and disaster-related services. Lawful permanent residents and qualified immigrants, such as H-2A workers, used to face a five-year or longer waiting period for programs like SNAP, but immigration and anti-hunger advocates suggest that period may be lengthier under the new administration — and the opportunity for noncitizen eligibility for food benefits may even cease to exist. If you have a U.S.-born child, they can qualify for these benefits, though it may not be enough to feed the entire family.
Please note that anyone visiting food centers or shelters may be asked to provide proof of identification. Because of stricter immigration policies enforced under the Trump administration, there is concern among immigration advocates, lawyers, and other experts that undocumented residents, those on a visa, or even legal citizens could be detained by law enforcement or U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Connect with your local immigration organizations or legal aid groups for more specific information, advice, and updates.

What to know about deepening hunger and disasters
As Kassandra Martinchek, who researches food access at the Urban Institute, told Grist in 2024, the immediate emergency food response provided by charitable providers and by federal nutrition programs “is an important part of the broader patchwork of programs that help families post-disaster.” But food insecurity “is really this household economic condition wherein families aren’t able to get the food they need to live a healthy and active life.” Disasters intensify that crisis.
Poverty rates tend to climb in impacted areas because many people, particularly those from low-income households, are less able to prepare for a looming storm or recover from the emotional and physical damage they wreak. This deepens existing racial and socioeconomic divides and exacerbates the food insecurity most commonly experienced by communities of color, those with disabilities, and households below the federal poverty line.
Research shows that food tends to be among the first expenditures financially unstable households cut during economic turbulence. Not only do they buy less food, but the quality of the food they buy decreases as well.
If you or someone you know is struggling with hunger or food insecurity at any time, reach out to churches or other houses of worship, charities, food banks, health care providers (some have food programs they can direct you to), including any of the organizations mentioned above.

When a major storm blows through town, local, state, and tribal governments rely on federal funding to help them recover. Rebuilding schools and roads, repairing power lines, and cleaning up debris stretch local budgets, and families need assistance to rebuild or repair their homes or cover the cost of temporary housing. Securing money from the federal government, however, can take months, and distributing it can take even longer. As of late May, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, had a backlog of emergency declaration requests from winter and spring storms and rejected some requests for aid. The Trump administration has signaled that it wants states to shoulder more of the burden of disaster relief, but as of June, FEMA has not yet implemented any changes to the disaster declaration process.

What are the major types of natural disasters?
Natural disasters include all types of severe weather, including winter storms, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, and wildfires. Extreme heat, though not considered an official disaster by FEMA, can be just as dangerous.
These events pose a significant threat to human health and safety, as well as infrastructure. Below are more details on different types of natural disasters. (For simplicity, they will be referred to as “disasters” throughout this toolkit.)
Hurricanes
A hurricane is a tropical storm with sustained winds that top 74 miles per hour. The National Weather Service rates hurricanes on a scale of Category 1 through 5 based on their wind speeds. Category 5 storms are considered the strongest, with wind speeds over 157 miles per hour.
Rising global temperatures are changing the dynamics of hurricanes, and wind speed does not always equate to severity: Lower category storms may produce more rainfall and more damage from flooding. Some researchers have advocated for adjusting how storms are categorized to better reflect their hazards. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, or NOAA, designates June 1 to November 30 as hurricane season in the Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico, as well as the Pacific Ocean. But most hurricanes that make landfall occur between August and October, when the conditions for a hurricane — warm waters and high winds — are most likely.
The National Hurricane Center, run by NOAA, tracks hurricanes. NOAA also has a website with much more information about hurricanes.

Wildfires
Wildfires are unplanned fires that often start in forests, rangelands, and grasslands and quickly spread. In 2024, for instance, they burned over 8 million acres. The Western U.S. is often considered the epicenter for wildfires, but these blazes also happen — and are becoming more severe — in the South, Midwest, and Northeast. The seasons for wildfires are typically summer and fall, but that is changing as well as the warming climate alters precipitation patterns. The Los Angeles area wildfires in 2025, for instance, happened in January. Wildfires can start from natural causes such as lightning, but they are also often caused by humans forgetting to extinguish campfires, or by faulty electrical lines. The National Interagency Fire Center has more information about wildfire conditions.

Tornadoes
Tornadoes form when warm and cool air masses collide, resulting in strong winds that begin to rotate in a column reaching the ground at speeds anywhere between 100 and 500 miles per hour. Heavy rain or hail may accompany them. These conditions typically happen during thunderstorms, but that’s not always the case. Read more from NOAA about tornadoes.
The State of Michigan also maintains a webpage of information on tornadoes.
A tornado itself may be relatively small in size, but it can travel across dozens of miles before wind speeds drop, carving a path of destruction. In North America, tornadoes tend to occur in the southern plains from May to June, early spring along the Gulf Coast, and June and July in the Midwest. But they can pop up any time of year, almost anywhere, and that’s happening more frequently: Some evidence suggests that “tornado alley,” the area of the U.S. where tornadoes are most likely, is moving eastward. Tornadoes are not as easy to predict as hurricanes or wildfires and can change direction quickly, so you may not have much time to prepare once you hear a tornado siren or get an alert about a warning. There are many myths about tornadoes, including that they do not hit large cities or cross bodies of water. The Missouri state government has a list of other misconceptions here.

Floods
Flooding is an overflowing of water onto land. This can happen during heavy rainfall or when dams or levees break. Flash floods can happen within minutes of intense rain, which makes them especially dangerous. They can happen anywhere, at any time — not just on the coast or near a river. Floodwaters can fill small creeks and streams that normally run dry; in cities, water can overwhelm storm systems and submerge streets; storm surge from hurricanes can inundate cities. Inland flooding is common and growing in some parts of the country, particularly in the Appalachian Mountains.
You can read more details about types of floods on NOAA’s website, and Grist has more information on how climate change exacerbates storms and flooding. Even if your home isn’t in a flood zone, you might still be at risk. More than a quarter of claims filed through FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program include homes that are not in official flood zones. Though there’s a common misconception that flooding rarely occurs in winter, flooding, especially inland flooding, can happen at any time of year.

Winter storm
Winter storms can bring extreme heavy snow or ice, freezing rain, sleet, and high winds that can block roads, damage homes, cause power outages, and put lives in danger — especially if temperatures drop well below freezing and stay there. Winter storms can happen all over the U.S., even in places that don’t typically see snow. In 2021, Texas and the Deep South experienced a historic winter storm that left people without power and water for days. Read more about winter weather here from FEMA.
How is a disaster officially ‘declared’?
There is a specific process cities, states, and tribal governments must go through to receive federal disaster aid that allows them to access federal funding and resources for both public infrastructure and individual household repairs and rebuilds. Here’s how it works:
Step 1: Local emergency managers and public officials work with FEMA on a preliminary damage assessment.
This assessment, done by local officials and a regional FEMA office, examines the damage caused by the natural disaster, the cost estimates for the work ahead, and types of federal assistance needed. The assessment, according to FEMA, must “show that the disaster is of such severity and magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the state and the affected local governments or Indian tribal government.”

Step 2: State governor or tribal government requests presidential disaster declaration within 30 days of the disaster.
They must show they’re using all their available resources and describe what type of federal assistance is needed to the president through their FEMA regional office (there are 10 total). Tribal governments go through a different process, which is outlined here. States or tribal governments may decide that the extent of a disaster isn’t large enough to warrant a damage assessment, or they might apply and get rejected by the president for additional aid.
Step 3: Federal aid is allocated after approval by the FEMA regional office and president.
There are two types of declarations, which both allow for federal spending on aid: Emergency declarations supplement local government efforts in providing emergency services; major disaster declarations provide a wide range of federal assistance programs for individuals and public infrastructure.
The federal government can disagree with the damage assessment that a state submits or deny requests for aid. In extreme cases, the president can also expedite a disaster declaration without having to catalog the full cost because damages are so widespread and severe. Remember, many disasters are not federally declared, or even declared by the state, but still cause damage and disruption.

(Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)States must begin verifying millions of Medicaid enrollees’ monthly work status by the end of next year — a task some critics say states will have a hard time carrying out.
A provision in the tax and spending bill President Donald Trump signed into law July 4 will require the 40 states plus Washington, D.C., that have expanded Medicaid to check paperwork at least twice a year to ensure those enrollees are volunteering or working at least 80 hours a month or attending school at least half time.
The new law provides states $200 million for fiscal year 2026 to get their systems up and running. But some experts say states will have difficulty meeting the deadline with that funding and worry enrollees might lose their health benefits as a result.
A year and a half to comply is likely not going to be enough time for most states, especially since the federal government must craft guidance on how they should implement their programs, said Dr. Benjamin Sommers, a health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. He predicted it will be difficult to create technology simple enough — such as a phone app — to streamline the process for all enrollees.
“Two hundred million [dollars] is not going to cover the 40 expansion states that we have,” he told Stateline. “There is not a silver bullet here, and there isn’t a single app out there that’s going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That’s just not realistic.”
Medicaid cuts could be devastating for the Delta and the rest of rural America

A spokesperson for the North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, Hannah Jones, told Stateline that “it will take a significant amount of time and investment in order to implement work requirements.”
Jones said an estimated 255,000 people in North Carolina could lose coverage because of these requirements and their “administrative burden.”
“More automation reduces manual work on beneficiaries and eligibility case workers, but it requires more time, funding, and staff resources to implement,” Jones wrote in an email.
Emma Herrock, a spokesperson for the Louisiana Department of Health, wrote in an email that the vast majority of the state’s Medicaid enrollees already work, and the agency expects few people to be disenrolled. Herrock said the department will establish work verification systems by the end of 2026.
“The department is taking a thoughtful approach to implementation,” Herrock wrote. “We are already working with several Louisiana agencies … in order to receive data on recipients who are working.”
She added that the department views work requirements “as a means to grow our economy, while reinforcing the value of work and self-sufficiency.”
In New York, it could cost the state $500 million to administer the new requirements, New York Department of Health spokesperson Danielle De Souza wrote in an email.
Between 600,000 and 1.1 million individuals who are eligible for and enrolled in Medicaid could potentially lose coverage because of work reporting requirements, she wrote, based on what happened when states were required to resume checking eligibility after the COVID-19 health emergency ended.
“The department will remain steadfast in its commitment to protecting the health of all New Yorkers and will work to mitigate the impacts of this law,” De Souza wrote.
The new rules apply to states that expanded Medicaid to adults between the ages of 19 and 64 with incomes below 138% of the federal poverty line (about $22,000 for an individual), an option that was made available under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. More than 20 million people were enrolled through Medicaid expansion as of June 2024 — those are the patients who will face work requirements.










There isn't a single app out there that's going to keep people who should be in Medicaid from losing coverage. That's just not realistic.


– Dr. Benjamin Sommers, health economist at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health


Reapplying for Medicaid, which typically has been required once a year, already is burdensome for some patients, said Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association.
“On top of that, now we’re going to be challenging so many people who were at least able to deal with it financially with things like … proving that they got a job,” Mukkamala said in an interview.
Previous attempts at implementing work requirements have ended up costing states millions in administrative and consulting fees. And in some cases, people who were eligible for Medicaid lost their coverage due to paperwork issues.
Arkansas’ example
Several states wanted to implement work requirements during the first Trump administration. But only Arkansas fully did so, in 2018, before a federal judge halted the requirements. More than 18,000 Arkansas residents lost Medicaid coverage during the 10 months the requirements were in effect.
States push Medicaid work rules, but few programs help enrollees find jobs

Sommers, of Harvard, noted that most people were disenrolled because they didn’t know about the policy or made paperwork errors, not because they weren’t working.
“Red tape led to people losing their coverage,” he said. “They had more trouble affording their medications. They were putting off needed care.”
Brian Blase, president of the Paragon Health Institute, a conservative policy group that advises congressional Republicans, said he thinks concerns about the new requirements are overblown because there’s more advanced technology now.
“Lots of government programs have initial implementation challenges,” Blase told Stateline. “Arkansas was seven years ago, and if you just think about the change in the technological advancements over the past seven years … we didn’t have artificial intelligence and just the ability of modern tech.”
As it stands, each state has varying technological capabilities, and will have a different timeline and budget, said Michael Heifetz, a managing director at consulting firm Alvarez & Marsal and a former Medicaid director in Wisconsin. His team contracts with states to implement Medicaid, including work requirements, and other programs.
He also noted that the Trump administration can give states a deadline extension on implementing work requirements to Dec. 31, 2028, if they show they are making a “good faith effort.” States will need to share data across agencies in new ways, he said.
“It will require some form of data sharing and communications with educational agencies, workforce training agencies and some other agencies that typically aren’t in the Medicaid ecosystem,” Heifetz said.
State governments may resist hiring full-time positions for those tasks, he said, but “artificial intelligence and other tools can help work through these processes in a smoother fashion.”
Other state efforts
Efforts in other states to implement work requirements have had mixed results.
In Georgia, for example, an experimental work requirement program cost taxpayers more than $86 million in its first 18 months but enrolled just 6,500 people during that time, according to an investigation by ProPublica and The Current published in February. That’s 75% fewer participants than the state had estimated for the program’s first year.
States that enshrined Medicaid expansion in their constitutions could be in a bind

The nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office in 2019 looked at five states that tested systems to track Medicaid work requirements under the first Trump administration. Those demonstration projects were rescinded during the Biden administration.
The states estimated their projected administrative costs for implementing work requirements for one to three years, and the total far surpassed the $200 million Congress has provided in the new law. Kentucky alone estimated $270 million, Wisconsin $70 million, Indiana $35 million, Arkansas $26 million and New Hampshire $6 million.
Susan Barnidge, an assistant director on the GAO health care team and an author of the report, said the agency found that across states there wasn’t much federal oversight of administrative costs on test programs. Oversight will be key as states roll out their work requirement systems, she said.
“We found some weaknesses in [federal] Centers for Medicare & Medicaid oversight of certain federal funding for certain administrative activities. So we found examples of things that states sought federal funding for that didn’t appear to be allowable,” Barnidge said in an interview. “I think that will remain relevant.”
Mukkamala, of the American Medical Association, said the burden will in some ways fall to doctors’ offices to help keep patients enrolled, as they work with patients to check eligibility and possibly help get them on Medicaid. He works in Flint, Michigan, as an otolaryngologist, or ear, nose and throat doctor, and said a third of his patients are on Medicaid.
“As if it’s easy to take care of their health care issue, given things like prior authorization,” Mukkamala told Stateline. “Now to add to the challenge, we have to figure out how to get them covered.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-16 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"As political sands shift on immigration, some CT Reps pivot",Emilia Otte and Lisa Hagen,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/16/trump-immigration-policy-ct-lawmakers/,"Some CT lawmakers supported enforcement efforts against immigrants with criminal pasts, but they are now balking at heavy-handed approaches.","Back in February 2024, a controversial bill came up in the U.S. House of Representatives that would have allowed immigrants to be deported if they were convicted of driving under the influence.
Connecticut U.S. Reps. Jahana Hayes, D-5th District, Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, and Jim Himes, D-4th District, voted in favor.
The Senate didn’t take up the bill at the time. But now, with Republicans controlling the White House as well as Congress, a similar bill is in play — and Connecticut’s representatives are rethinking their roles in an evolving political atmosphere.
Hayes and Courtney voted against the new bill last month. 
“I’m looking at these things through a very different lens — in the context of the environment that we’re in and just really trying to consider what the end goal of my Republican colleagues is on this legislation,” Hayes told The Connecticut Mirror after the recent vote on the DUI bill.
Although some Connecticut lawmakers began the session in favor of certain enforcement efforts against immigrants with criminal histories, they are now balking at an enforcement system they see as heavy-handed and in conflict with people’s legal rights while in the country.
Through legislation like H.R. 875, the Laken Riley Act and the budget bill that passed earlier this month, the GOP-led Congress has aligned itself with the Trump administration’s larger strategy of focusing on detentions and deportations while eliminating some opportunities for immigrants to enter or remain in the U.S.
Such legislative action could shake up the economy and communities in Connecticut, and some immigration lawyers are starting to see the ripple effects from new laws.
The legislation
The title of H.R. 875, “Jeremy and Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act of 2025,” references three people who were killed, in two separate instances, when an unauthorized migrant who was driving drunk collided with them in a driving accident. Jeremy and Angel Seay were newlyweds in Alabama; Brandon Mendoza, 32, was struck while driving home from work in Mesa, Arizona.
During debate on the bill, Republican sponsor Barry Moore of Alabama said he knew the Seays personally. He called it a “simple common-sense bill” that he pointed out garnered significant Democratic support last time.
When local groups heard H.R. 875 was coming up for a vote, immigrant rights advocates in Connecticut started to urge constituents to reach out to the members of Congress who supported it in the past.
“We MUST speak out. CT’s Reps Jahana Hayes (CT-5), Joe Courtney (CT-2), and Jim Himes (CT-4) voted YES on similar bills before. Their offices aren’t hearing enough opposition,” read a June 24 Facebook message urging people to call and text the representatives. 
The push was an effort to double down after Hayes and Courtney voted for the Laken Riley Act, the first bill Trump signed into law this year. (Himes and the rest of the delegation opposed it.) It requires U.S. officials to detain any immigrant without legal status who has been arrested, charged or convicted of burglary, larceny, theft, shoplifting or a crime that causes death or serious bodily injury.
Courtney noted the distinctions between the immigration measures the House voted on this year: He sees Laken Riley Act as a “detention bill” and H.R. 875 as a “deportation bill.”
“Detention doesn’t mean you’re deported, and it still left open the door for due process and a hearing,” Courtney said in an interview with CT Mirror. “If you read [H.R. 875], it creates sort of an impression, at least, that there is no due process because they amended the deportation statute.”
He added the administration’s changes to Temporary Protected Status — legal protections for people who are from countries with ongoing armed conflict and environmental disasters — are raising fears of deportation, particularly for Haitians and Venezuelans. TPS protections have ended for Venezuela, and a federal judge blocked the termination in September for Haitians. Courtney’s office said he has received a lot of calls on immigration since Trump took office, particularly around TPS.
An aide said the congressman closely tracks input from those who call or write in and uses it to help inform his votes. On H.R. 875 specifically, his D.C. office only received outreach from constituents who were against the bill.
“Who would have thought you’d have a State Department and a Department of Homeland Security that basically dismisses due process as a requirement, which the 14th Amendment clearly creates for all persons. And that’s just getting brushed aside,” Courtney said. “It’s just a far different legal climate. It’s not even about control of the House. It’s really about those two departments.”
Hayes, however, said in April she regretted her vote in support of the Laken Riley Act. The provision about detaining someone over assaulting a law enforcement officer stuck out for her, but she said that part of the bill “was not worth the tradeoff of what I’m seeing now.”
“There’s already laws on the books about DUIs, and if someone is in the process already, that can be considered and addressed. But that’s not what [Republicans] are looking to do,” Hayes said. “I’ve said after the Laken Riley vote and hearing from my constituents that I was really optimistic that we’re trying to work together, but [H.R. 875] doesn’t do that.”
Constanza Segovia, co-founder of Hartford Deportation Defense, echoed Hayes.
“There’s already a process in place for people to be held accountable in the context of a DUI or driving under the influence. People should not have more grave consequences based on their immigration status,” she said.
For Himes, he said he backed H.R. 875 because it deports non-U.S. citizens only after they have been convicted in court. (The bill also bars entry into the country for any non-U.S. citizen who has been arrested for, or admits to, having driven under the influence.) 
“H.R. 875 would establish new grounds for deportation for non-citizens only after they’ve had their day in court and been convicted of a crime. I supported this legislation because it maintained clear procedural due process,” Himes said in a statement.
But Himes took issue with other moves by the Trump administration, including masked U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents arresting international college students, or Alligator Alcatraz, the new detention center built in Florida’s Everglades. He said those actions “call into question the president’s commitment to faithfully executing laws as he is sworn to do.”
Happening in Connecticut
Some immigration lawyers say they’re seeing some initial effects of new laws on the books.
Dana Bucin, an immigration attorney with Harris Beach Murtha LLC in Hartford, said one of her clients had recently been affected by the Laken Riley Act. A 22-year resident with children who are U.S. citizens, he was picked up by ICE and is currently being detained because of a past arrest on a minor charge that later resulted in a not-guilty finding, Bucin said. Now, she said, she’ll have to prove to ICE and the court that her client was found not guilty. 
“My guess is that they’re just picking up anybody with an arrest, whether that arrest resulted in a conviction or not,” Bucin said, adding that it was possible ICE wasn’t able to see the final result of her client’s case and assumed he’d been convicted. 
Bucin said the DUI bill penalizing permanent green card holders could open the door to a “slippery slope” for U.S. citizens.
But Hartford immigration attorney Chris Llinas said he saw the Laken Riley Act as largely duplicating laws that already existed. 
“Realistically a lot of folks who are getting locked up for immigration reasons … are going to end up locked up anyway, regardless of Laken Riley,” Llinas said.  
Maggie Mitchell Smith, the executive director of Integrated Refugee and Immigrant Services, or IRIS, said she was concerned about the impact that the Laken Riley Act and H.R. 875 could have on refugees, particularly young people between the ages of 15 and 25 who often have very little English and don’t have the necessary skills to make it in the workforce. 
“If they get into trouble, the consequences for them are significant. They will be returned to places that in many places they have never even set foot in. Many of them were born in refugee camps,” Smith said. 
Richard Stern, a New Haven native and the director of the Grover M. Hermann Center for the Federal Budget at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told CT Mirror that the Laken Riley Act was codifying into law policies that often get changed based on the administration in power. He added that although the Trump administration had begun by focusing on deporting criminals, entering the country without permission was still a crime.
“ The president made campaign promises to deport as many illegal aliens as possible, not just ones who have committed violent defenses,” he said. “Generally speaking, people that come here illegally, these are people who jump the line on people who’ve waited years to come here legally and done it by the book. These are people who are frankly involved — and sometimes they don’t really know what they’re getting into — in these kind of black-market labor situations  that a lot of times benefit employers here or the criminal cartels that kind of manage them.”  
He said he wasn’t surprised by the Democrats’ vacillation on support for the border, although he said that past bills touting support for the border were a bit “misleading” because they were more geared toward funding measures like additional immigration judges. (Trump’s big tax bill provides some funding for hiring additional judges.)
“ Liberals in government of the past do what they think is in their best interest. And so if they’ve got donors, they want this kind of labor group or that labor group, they make it happen,” he said. 
Tabitha Sookdeo, the executive director of CT Students 4 a Dream — which was part of the campaign for constituent outreach on H.R. 875 — said she felt that she hadn’t done enough to make it clear to federal representatives how their votes affect communities in Connecticut.
“ I think a lot of us have been focusing on state protections and state provisions and focusing on public education on a state level. And really what we need to be pivoting towards is this communications or this public education work on a federal level,” said Sookdeo. 
The DUI bill will now head to the Senate, though the timing for a vote is unclear. But Segovia said she was less concerned about U.S. Sen. Chris Murphy and U.S. Sen. Richard Blumenthal based on “their track record.” Murphy and Blumenthal both voted against the Laken Riley Act in January.
The budget bill
Enhancing criminal penalties is not the only action Congress has taken that will affect immigration. Perhaps the most significant changes lie in the sweeping budget reconciliation bill, known as the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” that passed earlier this month. 
Democrats all voted against the bill, with Connecticut’s delegation decrying cuts to Medicaid and nutrition assistance that will affect people across the U.S., many of whom are low-income.
The bill will also prevent many immigrants from accessing Medicaid and SNAP benefits, a change that Mitchell Smith says will be particularly problematic for refugees. She said that because of their proximity to Yale University, her agency often receives people who have complex, chronic medical needs. Their care is paid for through Medicaid.
And while refugees work, she said, that doesn’t mean their jobs will offer health insurance. 
“It’s taking a couple of generations now … for refugees to be able to find their footing and have the kind of employment that includes a decent health care plan,” she said.  
The bill also includes extensive funding for border enforcement, as well as a number of fees for asylum seekers and immigrants on temporary statuses. And while Llinas acknowledged that the bill includes funding for immigration judges, he said that funding was miniscule in comparison to how much was being invested in building up ICE.
Connecticut’s federal lawmakers have been supportive of enhanced border funding before. In the last session of Congress, Murphy helped craft an immigration compromise bill that, had it passed, would have approved billions of dollars to increase border funding. But earlier this month, he said he wouldn’t support an even larger pot of money in Trump’s tax bill going toward what he called an “unlawful immigration enforcement system” that could prevent people from applying for asylum.
As Democrats have railed against other parts of the bill, they have paid noticeably less attention to the border measures in the GOP budget bill. When asked about that during a recent press briefing alongside Murphy, Blumenthal acknowledged that Democrats have been less focused on it, arguing that there are even more hurtful provisions inserted to reduce spending. He noted he’s also a proponent of border security and enforcement but argued it’s “just throwing money at a broken system.”
“We’re talking here about programs like Medicaid cuts, nutritional reductions, student loans, energy tax credits, that will be painful for everyday Americans and people in Connecticut,” Blumenthal said. “And the border security part of it is important and it wastes a lot of money and that’s one reason why we’ve been critical of it.”",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Danbury_Rally_EO2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-16 05:02:19.683604

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.
Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time, and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

Josh Williams speaking on the House floor. (Photo courtesy of the Ohio Channel.)Ohioans will need to submit their photo ID to watch pornography beginning this fall, with explicit content giant PornHub likely to consider pulling out of providing content to the state.
If you can imagine it, there’s a video for it — all for your viewing pleasure.
“We are expressing and practicing our sexual activity in a way that is private and is healthy and is unique to us,” Clevelander Mallory McMaster said.
But starting at the end of September, McMaster said she will have to find a new way to express her sexuality.
“Creating a log of the pornography that we watch is not a direction that we want to go in as a country,” she said.
To crack down on kids and teens accessing porn, state Reps. Josh Williams, R-Sylvania, and Steve Demetriou, R-Bainbridge Twp., put a provision in the state budget requiring every porn watcher to provide age verification.
“We’re gonna preserve and protect the innocence of our kids here in the state of Ohio,” Williams said Monday.
Verification would be done by submitting a photo of your state ID or by entering your personal information into a third-party system that will then run your details through other online or government databases — it could also use facial recognition technology, capturing photos of users.
Companies would be penalized if they don’t comply.
“Shut down that website if necessary,” he added.
Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost will be able to file civil lawsuits against companies, which could lead to court injunctions, Williams said.
The language, starting on page 655 of Ohio House Bill 96, states that an establishment that is primarily centered on explicit content and makes a significant amount of money on said content will need to follow this law. However, others that host pornography may still be subject to the law.
News media organizations, cable and streaming providers have an explicit exemption. Williams said that this won’t impact social media sites like X (formerly known as Twitter) and Reddit.
McMaster fears that data could be leaked. In 2024, hackers have stolen medical, financial, and legal data from at least hundreds of thousands of Ohioans at both the state and local levels. Many of the reported cyberattacks do not state how many consumers have been impacted.
Lawmakers argue that companies would be required to have a system that protects and deletes sensitive information immediately after verification. If someone is a paid subscriber, then their information must be deleted two years after the creation date if the user doesn’t renew.
Williams says if adults are worried, they can avoid online sites.
“You can go on and purchase your old school DVDs and watch your pornography at home,” Williams said, adding that this is simply like walking into an old video rental store where consumers are ID’d at the entrance or cash register. “We will not sacrifice the innocence of our children for the inconvenience of adults.”
The law also has a provision that uses geofences and geolocation to block users, with Williams saying this will make it harder to use virtual private networks, or VPNs, which mask your IP address and let you bypass firewalls.
The “location-based tech provider” would “dynamically monitor” a user attempting to access a website. If the provider determines the individual lives in Ohio, they must block them.
When we previously spoke to McMaster, she talked about her fears that local law enforcement would get access to search histories, since some third-party companies secretly provide facial recognition data to police, according to The Brookings Institution.
PornHub, the most visited explicit content provider in the country, and its parent company, Aylo, previously gave us a statement about states that have implemented these requirements, saying in part: “People did not stop looking for porn. They just migrated to darker corners of the internet that don’t ask users to verify age, that don’t follow the law, that don’t take user safety seriously, and that often don’t even moderate content.”
Aylo explained that they have always been a supporter of age verification of users, but that parents can add parental controls to their kids’ devices.
Because the U.S. Supreme Court decided that Texas’s similar requirement is constitutional, Pornhub has removed some of its sites in states with age verification laws. As of publishing, they have pulled out of 17 states.
“Unfortunately, the way many jurisdictions worldwide have chosen to implement age verification is ineffective, haphazard, and dangerous,” Aylo said. “Any regulations that require hundreds of thousands of adult sites to collect significant amounts of highly sensitive personal information is putting user safety in jeopardy.”
McMaster said that there are too many websites to track down, and this could drive traffic to providers that don’t have regulations on the ages of performers, the ability to take down sexual assault or nonconsensual content, and nonconsensual artificial intelligence like PornHub does.
“We’re actually going to make it harder to keep people watching healthy pornography,” she said.
Either way, Ohioans need to get their IDs ready starting on Sept. 29.

The Buckeye State trended at the lower end of fertility rates in 2023, with 56.4 births per 1,000 women, despite being in an area with the “greatest regional median general fertility rate” in the country, according to new research by the Pew Research Center.
The 2023 rate showed a drop in general fertility for every single state, with Ohio seeing an 8.9% decrease from the state’s average of 61.9 births per 1,000 between 2011 and 2020.
The birth rate for Ohio was slightly higher than the national average of 54.5 births per 1,000 women.
Of the births that happened in Ohio, the greatest percentage occurred for women aged 30 to 34, with pregnancies in 25 to 29-year-olds coming in a close second. The state saw 14.1% of births happening in women aged 35 to 39 in 2023.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Births to mothers younger than 20 and ages 20 to 24 both fell drastically in Ohio compared to 2007 numbers.
Births to mothers aged 20 or younger represented 11% of all Ohio births in 2007, but in 2023, that number was 4.4%.
In 2007, 26.5% of births in the state were to 20 to 24-year-old mothers, but the rate fell to 19.2% in 2023.
The trending age groups fall in line with the national average, where 30.5% of births were to 30 to 34-year-old women, and 27.4% were in the 25 to 29-year-old range.
The national general fertility rate had the largest annual decrease in 30 years as of 2020, and the downward trend continued into 2023.
Even taken individually, most states in the country and Washington, D.C., have the lowest general fertility rates in more than 30 years, according to the data from Pew.
“Historically, fertility rates have dipped during economic downturns but tended to recover as conditions improved,” researchers said in the report.
But after the Great Recession from 2007 to 2009, fertility rates “fell and never bounced back.”
The COVID-19 pandemic didn’t help, but 2021 saw a slight increase, “which probably reflected births from pregnancies that women decided to delay during the early pandemic months,” the report stated.
That increase only lasted a short time before the fertility rate decrease “quickly resumed its long-running downward trajectory.”
The birth rate drop is significant enough that conservatives, including Vice President JD Vance and others in the Trump administration, have debated incentivizing birth, though American women are still hesitant.
The Pew report said women are generally having fewer children than previous generations, and the reasons range from financial concerns like student loan debt, housing costs, and the cost of child care, to the desire for higher education levels or career success.
The Midwest and South recorded the highest fertility rates in 2023, holding 20 of the 25 states where rates were higher than the national general fertility rate.
The West has had a “pronounced shift,” however, falling from the top region for fertility rates in the 2000s to the second-lowest in 2023.
Population growth in the West is now coming from “an influx of people from other states and abroad rather than an increase in births,” according to the report.
Preliminary data for 2024 shows a slight uptick in the national fertility rate of 0.2% from the previous year, but the impacts of the negative trends have already shown up in state economics, according to researchers.
“Many of the short-term fiscal effects may prove positive for states, but over time, these smaller birth cohorts may create broader challenges,” the report stated.
More immediately, less children means cost savings in areas like health care and education, according to the center’s research, with a reduction in teen pregnancies saving taxpayers billions when it comes to spending by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on safety net programs for young mothers, including Medicaid.
But the long-term effects could mean increased pressures on state coffers, with the first of the smaller birth-rate groups reaching adulthood in 2026, meaning a smaller group of working-age adults “that may eventually shrink tax bases and limit revenue growth.”
“State policymakers must reckon with the question of how best to navigate lower fertility rates and related fiscal impacts,” Pew found in the report.

The next time someone tries tell you that the North Carolinians with Medicaid health insurance are lazy slackers who participate in a wasteful program that warrants the massive bloodletting President Trump just approved, tell them talk to an actual frightened person who depends on the program.
Someone like Maddie Wertenberg. She’s a Wake County mom who had private health insurance, but who still only avoided being stuck with life-altering hospital bills for the care of her premature baby, because he was so tiny he qualified for Medicaid.
Or someone like Crystal Upchurch. She’s a lifetime Raleigh resident who is only alive because Medicaid covers the cost of the daily dialysis treatments she receives.
The bottom line: Proponents of Trump’s big bill may say they have no intention of cutting off people like Maddie and Crystal, but the massive funding cuts make it inevitable that vast numbers of people with similar stories will be sentenced to crippling debt and premature death. And the sheer cruelty at work here, and the terror its inflicting on millions of good people, is hard to overstate.

A contested solar agrivoltaics project avoided having its permit denied by Ohio regulators, likely thanks to the neutral stances of a county board and one of its townships.


The Ohio Power Siting Board approved construction of the 120-megawatt Frasier Solar project late last month despite local groups’ organizing efforts, which led the other township within the project’s 840-acre footprint and a neighboring township to pass anti-solar resolutions. The power siting board has found that unanimous local government opposition was reason enough to decide other solar projects did not meet a public interest requirement under state law. One of those cases is before the Ohio Supreme Court.


In the Frasier case, however, local governing bodies for Knox County and Clinton Township stayed neutral. Knox County voted unanimously in 2023 to accept a payment arrangement instead of property taxes, which will add more than $40 million for local governments over the project’s 40-year useful life, but it took a neutral position on the project itself.


About six months after an evidentiary hearing — basically an administrative trial — on Frasier Solar, Knox County restricted new solar projects within most of its boundaries. However, legal counsel for the Ohio Ethics Commission found that a conflict of interest prevented Drenda Keesee, a newly elected Knox County commissioner, from taking official action against Frasier Solar because she owned property next to the project site. Another county commissioner served as an ad hoc power siting board member for the Frasier decision, so he could not take a position before hearing the case. He wound up voting with the board’s majority to grant the permit.


Prior to the administrative trial, Clinton Township’s board had clarified that despite an anti-solar position for future projects, it was officially neutral on Frasier Solar.


“We had a very small dog in the fight,” Clinton Township Trustee Jay Maners told Canary Media, noting that most of the project will be in Miller Township. He recalled that there was sparse attendance at early trustee meetings when the project was discussed, with most in favor of it. Then ​“everything exploded” with people suddenly voicing opposition, he said.


“There was a lot of misinformation,” Maners said, such as solar opponents falsely claiming tax dollars would pay for the project, and solar proponents warning about rising energy prices.


The Ohio Power Siting Board’s June 26 ruling discussed Clinton Township’s neutral stance on Frasier Solar, as well as that of Knox County, to stress that local government opposition was not unanimous. The board found that the project was in the public interest and approved the permit.


Supporters are celebrating the win for Frasier Solar but worry about how much the power siting board focused on whether local government opposition was unanimous. That leaves solar energy vulnerable to a standard that depends on potentially arbitrary local government rulings, rather than regulatory experts’ judgment of projects’ merits.


Frasier Solar is exempt from parts of Senate Bill 52, a 2021 law that lets counties block large solar and wind projects before they get to the power siting board. Yet its developer, Open Road Renewables, faced substantial local opposition and misinformation, much of which was stoked by a dark money group with multiple connections to fossil fuel interests and the anti-solar speakers it brought in. Opponents also went to local township meetings to push for anti-solar resolutions.


The staunch local opposition and involvement of fossil fuel interests fit a pattern playing out across the country. The Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University last month reported a 32% jump in the number of contested projects for 2024 compared with 2023.


Only within the past few years have state regulators used unanimous local government opposition as a reason to kill proposed solar projects. Those projects, like Frasier, were otherwise exempt from parts of the 2021 law. But Ohio regulations don’t contain such a rule. Another part of Ohio law appears to say that local government consent isn’t a condition for siting decisions.


“I’m certainly happy to see this project move forward, and it had every reason to move forward,” said Dan Sawmiller, Ohio energy policy director for the Natural Resources Defense Council. Yet he questioned what the role of the power siting board is if it lets unanimous local opposition control whether projects go ahead.


“They’ve got the goal post cemented in, and it’s in the wrong location,” Sawmiller said. As he sees it, the board and its staff have a responsibility to use their expertise to make decisions in the public interest for the whole state.

It’s also hard to fact-check local government resolutions, said Heidi Gorovitz Robertson, a Cleveland State University law professor who testified as an expert witness for the Ohio Environmental Council. Those decisions could be based on misinformation or simply be a response to political pressure, with little focus on the factual basis for objections.

 Facts vs. misinformation

Frasier Solar became ​“known nationally as part of a case study on how the fossil fuel industry stokes opposition to renewable energy projects,” said Dave Anderson, policy and communications director for the Energy and Policy Institute, a watchdog group on utility and fossil fuel influence.


Testimony at the administrative trial revealed that an anti-solar group called Knox Smart Development had big financial backing by Tom Rastin, who has been a leader of the Empowerment Alliance, an anonymously funded group that promotes the natural gas industry. Rastin is a former vice president of Ariel Corp., which makes equipment for the oil and gas industry.


Anti-solar media flourished throughout the area during the permitting process too. An eight-page Ohio Energy Reporter sent by bulk mail consisted mostly of anti-solar advertorials. Anti-solar stories and ads also ran in outlets such as the Mount Vernon News, which ProPublica described as a conservative ​“pink slime” publication.


Evidence introduced by the developer last summer characterized some of the opposition’s publicity as ​“misinformation campaigns,” which the power siting board noted in its opinion.


Nonetheless, the project had an ​“encouraging level of support, both locally and from across the state,” said Craig Adair, vice president for development at Open Road Renewables. About 40% of those who spoke at local public hearings or filed comments favored the project.


More significantly, the siting board considered the merits of comments, not just the total numbers. In doing so, the board focused on Robertson’s testimony, which found that half of opponents’ unique arguments at local hearings were factually inaccurate or unsupported by evidence. About a third were already addressed by permit conditions, and nearly one-tenth were just subjective opinions, she also found.


“The happy news is that the siting board and the staff weren’t snowed by the number of opposing comments,” Robertson told Canary Media. ​“We really were able to take the wind out of their sails on the vast majority of the negative comments.” A similar analysis may help in future cases, she suggested. ​“We can’t let truth and facts disappear. We have to keep pushing what is real.”


The board’s ruling also noted evidence provided by chapters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers about jobs and other positive economic benefits. Additional experts for the Ohio Environmental Council described how the solar farm and revenue from it could help local governments deal with climate change impacts.


“Given the risks Ohio faces from climate change, the board’s review of any application is incomplete without considering impacts,” said Karin Nordstrom, one of the Ohio Environmental Council’s lawyers in the case.


Adair welcomed the other parties’ supporting evidence and said he hopes to see the same level of scrutiny in future cases. ​“As long as the board continues to review projects on their merits and not fall prey to the misinformation, it’s encouraging,” he said.


Still, solar and wind projects continue to face hurdles under state law that don’t apply to fossil fuels. While counties now have the power to block most large solar and wind projects, local governments can’t even enforce zoning restrictions against oil and gas development.


“A lot of businesses are going to say, ​‘I’ll take my investment elsewhere,’” Adair said. And while some projects like Frasier may get approval, the combination of SB 52 and other deference to local governments ​“is going to leave you vulnerable to getting the supply that you need on the grid,” he added.

The center works to create connections, cultivate skills and open doors of opportunity. (Dave Redmon)Apprehensive, I ducked into Be Able Community Center in Manhattan for the first time three years ago, wanting to learn more about what I’d been hearing.
Located in a former lumber yard near the railroad tracks on the south edge of downtown, this was a safe and comfortable place offering free hot coffee, Wi-Fi and phone charging plus computer access, TV, chairs, supplies of donated food — and a healthy circle of influential people. Up a short flight of stairs was one small restroom.
Whose responsibility is it to help our neighbors? Founder Scott Voos was asking himself that question at a turning point in his life. In the thick of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, Voos — alongside Marlon Jackson — opened Be Able’s doors at a time when other organizations were closing theirs.
Gradually, the surrounding community embraced the magic. Ever since, it’s been a place engaged with those in adversity by creating connections, cultivating skills and opening doors of opportunity. Individuals are connected to medical and mental health resources, employment training and housing assistance — with a goal of reducing crises and homelessness while building stability.
Be Able is a daytime center where you can keep to yourself or seek out a friendly ear — your choice. Staff members — some of whom have faced tough times themselves — seem indistinguishable from neighbors ranging from teens to the elderly seeking a safe place. Case management and free consulting are available to anyone who asks.
Staff and volunteers are trained to operate from a stance of love and non-judgment toward those who perhaps don’t fit in, are reluctant to move forward or don’t know how — with an emphasis on first listening to and then coaching neighbors toward solutions. Replacing lost identification papers, finding employment and troubleshooting situations remain common problems.
On the walls are the Be Able code: “Humble, Tender, Willing, Patient, Awkward, Brave. Here you will strive to be better than before.” God, community, collaboration, integrity and discernment are guiding principles. Through its supporters and partners, Be Able sees itself as part of a larger faith-based community that is extraordinary in its scope and generosity. Neighbors are matched with staff or volunteer advocates with specific earned-life experiences.
Separate restrooms were added in 2023 while a laundry, showers and an art and education facility took shape in a smaller building a few steps away — offering dignity and self worth for those lacking access to basic amenities.
Staffing has grown to 10 — including a health care navigator and transitional housing director. Out back, vegetables are harvested from a large garden. About 50 volunteers offer regular assistance with these and other activities, including a jail mentorship program and a bicycle rehabilitation program supplying transportation to dozens in need. In all, Be Able estimates that 150 volunteers have made themselves available since its founding.
With a budget of $405,000 last year, Be Able served 1,100 individuals. This year’s budget of $530,000 is enabling it to assist an estimated 1200 people, Voos reports. Averaged over the last two years, about 55% of contributions came from about 900 individuals, 20% from local organizations and 25% from local grants.
Listening to personal stories, I began recording first-person accounts of neighbors who had hit bottom and glimpsed some light. The result was a 36-page book published in December 2023 with watercolor portraits by Steven Moser. “Turning Points” is available at Manhattan Public Library.
My journey of self discovery helped me see myself in others I’d always tried to avoid. Nobody escapes being wounded — physically, emotionally, mentally or spiritually. The main question, observed Henri Nouwen, who wrote “The Return of the Prodigal Son,” is not how can we hide our wounds to escape embarrassment but how can we put our woundedness in the service of others — becoming wounded healers ourselves?

When this reached an almost unbelievable extreme in the case of the Frasier solar project in Knox County, it led to the drawing of a proverbial “line in the sand.” Some grassroots solar advocates joined together in the hope that a collective effort might have a chance to push back.
From the beginning, this was “David versus Goliath.” The motivation of advocates had much to do with the strenuous warning from the science community that our civilization must shift away from fossil fuels if we wish to preserve a livable future for our children and future generations.
 The anti-solar side had numerous direct connections with the fossil fuel industry, and when these were exposed there was not even much attempt to hide them. 
The attitude from the start seemed to be “we are a wealthy industry, and if we apply our wealth to saturate the entire area with misinformation, there is no way that we lose this siting decision.”  
Rent a luxurious theater and pay for an expert in distortion to travel all the way from Chicago to explain why 99% of the world’s science community has it all wrong and that the continually unraveling climate is nothing but a hoax.  
What were the credentials of this speaker? That he came from the Heartland Institute famous for being hired by the tobacco industry to convince the public there is no danger to health from smoking cigarettes.
A major “problem” developed in the local news media. It was granting space to express both sides. 
Yes, this pesky thing called “democracy” was not acceptable. Lo and behold, money appeared in order to actually purchase the Mt Vernon newspaper.  
From that point on, it was almost “miraculous” how the whole community seemed to suddenly be united in opposing the solar project. 
Then came the public hearing. A few people came from outside Knox County because they recognized the sweeping nature of climate disruption does not pay attention to imaginary lines on a map called county boundaries. 
If there was ever an issue that said we are all in this together, this was it. 
Both attorneys for the opposition vehemently demanded that anyone from outside these lines had no right to speak. 
Never mind that both were themselves from outside the county. And never mind that the opposition brought in someone all the way from Chicago. Did someone mention blatant hypocrisy?
It was the wealth of an entire industry pitted against mere grassroots volunteers trying to make ends meet while eking out time to make a stand for the earth and future generations. 
Due to the colossal disparity between resources, it seemed a foregone conclusion that this project was going to become another casualty.
Beyond the local barrage of misinformation, something else was happening. 
The Ohio Power Siting Board was altering its decision-making process in a way that undeniably favored the fossil fuel industry.
It was saying that if a handful of local officials lined up in opposition to a project, that was pretty much the end of it. 
They were not even expected to present any rational reason of substance, but only had to say “no.” Whether a majority of the public supported it no longer mattered. 
All the industry needed was to conduct an intensive well-funded lobbying campaign to “lock up” the local officials, and that project would become history. 
But something unexpected happened. These grassroots volunteers were determined to not be intimidated. They were dedicated to not only continue speaking the truth, but also expose to the public how it was being cynically manipulated.  
A Pulitzer Prize winning investigative team was invited to expose the outrageous purchase of the newspaper. 
Articulate and well-documented writing was submitted for publication. A documentary producer was invited to expose the false claim that agricultural land was being taken out of use by the solar panels. 
His video demonstrated how solar panels and continuing agricultural use could easily co-exist on the same land.  
The developer of Frasier actually signed a contract with local sheep grazers so that the vast majority of the land would continue with agricultural use.
Something else very significant was that these advocates were not willing to allow the state agency responsible for siting decisions to turn into a rubber stamp for the fossil fuel industry. 
A very principled and cogent case was made directly to the Ohio Power Siting Board about how these new rules were skewing the process. The Board was challenged to defend its actions. 
The end result of it all was stunning. 
On June 26, the Board approved the project by a very strong 8 to 1 majority — setting off a major celebration by the solar advocates. 
What are some of the takeaway lessons that can be drawn? 
The power and effectiveness of grassroots volunteers must not be underestimated when they come together in the spirit of holding to the truth and refusing to be intimidated. 
Maximizing the use of free media in the form of letters to the editor, commentaries, and videos on YouTube. Not hesitating to call upon allies with which to work in coalition.  
May news of this resounding victory spread throughout the state and give hope to those striving to maintain forward progress even while Trump and MAGA continue to work against the climate issue and clean energy at the national level!

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
 The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
 Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

John Lewis.","A look at the Civil Rights Foot Soldiers Memorial in downtown Annapolis on July 7. (Photo by William J. Ford/Maryland Matters)The name of Rep. John Lewis can still draw a crowd — or more than 1,600 crowds, as will apparently be the case Thursday.
That’s when as many as 150,000 people are signed up to attend “Good Trouble Lives On” rallies in cities across the country, including Annapolis, which has been designated one of just four anchor cities nationally for larger commemorations.
The events are being held as part of the fifth annual John Lewis National Day of Action, to mark the anniversary of Lewis’ death in 2020, at age 80. More than 40 events of varying sizes are planned in Maryland alone.
“John Lewis is somebody I have a tremendous amount of respect for,” said Carl Snowden, convener of the Council of African American Leaders and a scheduled speaker at the Annapolis event. “I think John Lewis would be the first to tell people, ‘If you want this democracy to work, you must be engaged in that democracy.’”
Lewis, a civil rights icon, served 34 years in the U.S. House where the Georgia Democrat came to be known as the “conscience of the Congress.” He was among the speakers at the 1963 March on Washington, where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous “I Have A Dream” speech.
In March 1965, Lewis was severely beaten in March 1963 on “Bloody Sunday,” when a peaceful march from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, was set upon by Alabama state troopers as they crossed the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma. Five months later, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act into law.

The day of action has been held annually since his death, but this year’s is by far the largest, driven in party by reaction to the administration of President Donald Trump (R). Event organizers said that, as of Tuesday evening, more than 150,000 people had RSVP’d to more than 1,600 rallies in all 50 states, and a handful of international cities.
Before this year, said Daryl Jones, co-leader and board chair of the Transformative Justice Coalition, one of the organizations leading the rally efforts, the most rallies in a year had been 120. Jones, a former Anne Arundel County councilmember, said one main reason for the high expected turnout is Trump, particularly after congressional passage this month of the so-called big, beautiful bill
“People are offended by it and people want to respond, but they need an avenue to respond. This provides them with that avenue,” he said.
For the first time this year, event organizers set up a few anchor cities where people can congregate in a larger setting: Lewis’ home city of Atlanta; St. Louis; Oakland, California; and Annapolis.
Jones said Annapolis was chosen for a couple of reasons, such as its history as a port city during slavery.
“Number two, Maryland has a Black governor and the nation’s only African American governor,” he said. “It is a symbol of overcoming the odds. That’s where we are right now as a democracy is that we need to overcome the odds.”
Organizers invited Gov. Wes Moore (D), but a spokesperson said Monday it was “unclear” if the governor would be able to attend.
One elected official who plans to attend is Rep. Sarah Elfreth (D-3rd), her office confirmed Thursday. She is expected to have a speaking role, along with Evelyn DeJesus, executive vice president of the American Federation of Teachers, which filed suit against the U.S. Department of Education to block its plan to withhold federal funds from schools that refuse to end their diversity, equity and inclusion practices.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Snowden said Lewis’ “good trouble” presence can still be seen in Annapolis, citing the congressman’s “personal” endorsement of the Civil Rights Foot Soldiers Memorial, which remembers those from the area who were among the 250,000 in attendance at the March on Washington. That memorial was dedicated Aug. 28, 2013, on the 50th anniversary of the march.
The Annapolis event will start with marches from different points in town, to evoke memories of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, before ending up on Lawyer’s Mall by the State House at 6 p.m. for a rally.
Dozens of smaller events and activities are scheduled across the state, including 13 in Montgomery County alone.
Elly Shaw-Belblidia will join people holding signs and waving at motorists while standing near the Rockville Metro station. The focus, she said, will be to follow Lewis’ mantra of nonviolence and “getting in good trouble,” and to express displeasure with the Trump administration and the “horrible” experience of watching “the Republicans cave in on that [spending bill] legislation last week.”
“Holding signs and waving at people driving by is way to express yourselves,” she said. “Peaceful. Joyful. Trying to keep people’s faith up.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Civil-Rights-Foot-Soldiers-Memorial-7-7-2025-1024x582.jpg,,,2025-07-16 05:02:19.683604

(Photo by Lauren Lifke/Maryland Matters)State officials on Tuesday unveiled a new app that they said will mean fewer trips to a government office, less paperwork and an overall better and faster way to get help from the state for people applying for public benefits.
Akeisha Harley, a mother of four, hopes it can keep others from having to go through what she went through.
“I wish the One App was available when I got here and I had to apply for everything. I had to sit here and drag my kids through the rain, in strollers, in snow, on the bus, to sit here and get everywhere I had to go,” Harley said of her struggle to get assistance under the old process.
Harley was speaking at an event Tuesday at the United Communities Against Poverty Building in Capitol Heights where Gov. Wes Moore (D) and other state officials formally unveiled the Maryland Benefits One Application, which will let residents use a computer or phone to apply for benefits.
It also allows residents to use one application to apply for Medicaid, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, energy assistance and the Women, Infants and Children nutrition program.

“We have cut down the average application time by nearly a full hour,” Moore said. “From 80 minutes for SNAP alone, to 28 minutes for all benefits, all at once.”
People often forget, Moore said, that if someone’s situation merits them to be qualified for some benefits, they are often qualified for others. Applying for these applications separately forces them to keep reliving their situation, he said.
“It is extremely stressful sitting here and having to go over and over, meeting different people, and having to sit there and tell everybody your story,” Harley said.
Maryland Human Services Secretary Rafael López knows what that’s like.
“As a young person, I remember what it was like for my own mother to take multiple buses, extraordinary long walks and navigate government red tape to get the help she needed for her children. Marylanders, just like my mother, Maria López, are resilient and resourceful when it matters most,” he said.
But he and others said it doesn’t need to be like that any more.
The One App will be run under a platform previously known as MD THINK. Moore announced that it is now renamed Maryland Benefits. 
“The name change actually reflects our focus,” Moore said. “It reflects our focus on making governments more accessible and making sure that Marylanders can get the benefits they need in every part of the state”
The platform was soft-launched less than two weeks ago, and more than 22,000 Marylanders have completed the One App, Moore said.
“For families who are working out in Western Maryland — in some cases, by the way working two or three jobs and still living at or below poverty line — we are saying to them very clearly: You will not be left behind,” Moore said.
“This application means fewer forms, fewer trips, faster service, more support for families that need it most when they need it most,” he said.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/FullSizeRender-1-trimmed-e1752629667596-1024x669.jpeg,,,2025-07-16 05:02:19.683604

(Photo by Charlie Paullin/Virginia Mercury)Federal officials are calling on the state to reissue a permit for a wind farm planned off the Ocean City coast, to correct what they say is an error in the original document.
In a July 7 letter to the Maryland Department of the Environment, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency took issue with the process that MDE laid out to appeal the final construction permit awarded to US Wind.
The state said any challenge to the state permit would have to go through state courts, but EPA Region 3 Administrator Amy Van Blarcom-Lackey said that any appeal would have to be filed with the clerk of the EPA’s Environmental Appeals Board.
“Failure to rectify this error could result in invalidation of the permit on appeal and confusion among relevant stakeholders with respect to where to bring such an appeal,” Blarcom-Lackey wrote.
MDE spokesperson Jay Apperson said in a statement that the agency is reviewing Blarcom-Lackey’s letter and is “committed to ensuring all our permit processes are transparent and in accordance with the law.” An official with US Wind said the company is “confident that all of our project’s permits were validly issued.”
At issue is the permit issued last month by MDE’s Air and Radiation Administration, which found that “the proposed construction and commissioning of the offshore wind project would not cause violations of any applicable air pollution control regulations.” It’s one of the final permits for the US Wind project, which has been in the works for about a decade, and is closest to construction of any offshore wind farm planned for Maryland’s coast.
Maryland gives go-ahead to permit allowing offshore wind farm to move forward

The US Wind project received a critical approval from the federal Bureau of Ocean Energy Management in December, at the tail end of President Joe Biden’s administration. The federal government leased the area for the project to Baltimore-based US Wind in 2014.
The feds have leased other areas near the coast of Ocean City and the nearby Delaware beaches to Danish company Ørsted and, most recently, to Norwegian company Equinor.
US Wind’s application called for up to 121 turbines, up to four offshore substations and one meteorological tower, all about 10 nautical miles from the Ocean City shoreline — a prospect that has enraged some locals and politicians in the beach town, who have pointed to the view from shore of the wind farm, and its impacts on wildlife. The Town of Ocean City has an ongoing lawsuit against the U.S. Department of the Interior for issuing its approval for US Wind.
Like all offshore wind projects, US Wind is facing an uncertain environment under President Donald Trump (R), a vocal critic of the industry. Shortly after he took office, Trump issued an executive order halting new offshore wind leasing in federal waters, and new project approvals from the federal government.
In April, Interior Secretary Doug Burgum ordered one offshore wind project off the coast of New York to halt construction, citing deficiencies in the BOEM permit that had allowed construction to begin. But in May, the Trump administration reversed course and allowed the project to keep moving forward.
Interestingly, MDE’s webpage about the Ocean City project seems to contradict Blarcom-Lackey’s letter about the appeals process. The page was updated to exclude mentions of an appeal process through the EPA, which had previously been included.
“The appeals process for this permit is through the State of Maryland only, and the language describing the U.S. EPA appeals process has been removed,” reads the webpage.
Apperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the webpage.
In a statement, US Wind’s vice president of external affairs, Nancy Sopko, said that the company is confident the project’s paperwork is proper and is “very committed to delivering this important energy project to the region.”
“The state needs all the new sources of electricity we can build in order to keep prices affordable for homes and businesses,” Sopko wrote.

But debate continues about the program's scientific validity. (Photo provided by National Park Service)Alaska officials on Tuesday resurrected a controversial bear-killing program aimed at boosting caribou numbers.
The Alaska Board of Game, convening in a special meeting in Anchorage on the subject, authorized the state Department of Fish and Game to restart the program that has already killed 186 brown bears, five black bears and 20 wolves.
Board members and department officials said they had fixed legal flaws that prompted two state judges earlier this year to overturn the program and cut short the bear culls that state officials argue are needed to help the ailing Mulchatna caribou herd in Western Alaska.
State officials say the program is needed to help the faltering herd recover to levels that would allow hunting to resume.. Critics, including environmentalists and wildlife biologists outside of the Department of Fish and Game, say the program is scientifically unsound and that factors other than bears are behind the herd’s decline.
Board members said department officials, in presentations during the two-day meeting, had provided compelling evidence that predation by bears is the main reason for the herd’s problems.
And the board has an obligation to do whatever it can to allow residents of the region to resume their hunts of caribou, said one member, Vice Chair Stosh Hoffman of Bethel.
“The department is giving us a lot of good science and, it all made sense to me,” Hoffman said on Tuesday just prior to the approval vote. “I listened to the public and weighed everything, but the most important part of this is this herd has been identified for high use of harvest for Alaskans to eat and put away. And it’s been closed now for several years, since 2021.”
The Mulchatna herd peaked in the late 1990s at about 200,000 animals. It is down to a little under 15,000 animals now, according to the Department of Fish and Game. But that is an improvement from the lowest point, when the herd dipped below 13,000, department officials said, and they attributed the change to the past few years of predator control.

	The department’s goal is to have the herd grow to between 30,000 and 80,000 animals, enough to allow hunting to resume.
Department officials and board members also said the program will be safe for the overall bear population – targeted for relatively small areas that are used by the caribou herd for calving and limited to the spring season when calves are born. That is to limit the number of calves that are killed and eaten by bears, they said.
Doug Vincent-Lang, the department’s commissioner, promised that if any information emerges that the bear population’s sustainability is at risk, officials will adjust to protect the bears.
“We were trying to rebuild the caribou herd, but we’re not going to jeopardize long-term sustainability of bears in so doing,” he told the board on Tuesday, prior to the approval vote.
The bear-killing program has been mired in controversy since it began.
It was originally authorized by the Board of Game in early 2022, but critics said that board members circumvented normal public processes when they granted that approval. The first bear kills were carried out in 2023. That year and the following year, 175 brown bears were killed through aerial shooting, along with five black bears and 19 wolves, according to the department.
In March, Alaska Superior Court Judge Andrew Guidi ruled that the program violated provisions of the state constitution on multiple grounds. He found that state officials failed to provide meaningful public notice or opportunities for public comment and participation in the decision process and that the state had failed to analyze the program’s impacts to bear populations, thus violating the constitution’s requirement for sustainable management of natural resources.
Superior Court Judge Christina Rankin followed up in May with a ruling that pronounced the bear-killing program to be still void for this year, despite emergency action reauthorizing it, because the department and board had failed to fix the problems that Guidi identified in his earlier ruling.
Nonetheless, the Department of Fish and Game launched its bear-culling program days later, on May 10. Eleven brown bears were killed that weekend by state actions that Rankin concluded had violated court rulings. The activities stopped after she issued a restraining order.

	Critics of the program disagree that bears are to blame for the Mulchatna herd’s decline.
Environmentalists and other critics of the program have pointed to habitat changes in the region that have made it less suitable for lichen-eating caribou, though more suitable for browsers of woody plants like moose. They have also pointed to disease and past overhunting as possible contributors.
The critics also say the department has failed to show that the bear-killing program will not harm the region’s bear population.
Among the opponents is the Alaska Wildlife Alliance, which filed the lawsuit that resulted in the rulings against the program. The alliance mobilized a petition drive that it said drew 65,000 signatures opposing the action that the board ultimately took Tuesday. Additionally, there were 1,500 written comments submitted in opposition to the program, the alliance said.

“I think the decision around this proposal has largely been made, and we acknowledge that,” she said in testimony at the board meeting on Monday.
Nonetheless, she told board members, the alliance has submitted proposed amendments to clarify the objectives, establish specific measures of success and ensure that the program is limited in geographic scope and season.
As written, the program would allow the department to kill bears by aerial gunning in a 40,000 square mile area, with nothing limiting activities to the calving grounds or calving season, she told the board. The area borders Lake Clark National Park and Preserve, she said. And the area is only 30 miles from Katmai National Park and Preserve and less than 50 miles from the state-managed McNeil River State Game Sanctuary, both of which are world-class bear-viewing destinations that support state tourism, she said.
“I think the dismissal from the state of that bear-viewing argument is a misleading reflection of what this program, what this proposal is actually asking for,” she said.
The board rejected the alliance’s suggested amendments.
The legal fight over bear culls in the Mulchatna caribou range is not over.
A hearing is scheduled in state Superior Court on July 25 on a petition to find the Department of Fish and Game in contempt of court for proceeding with bear kills in May, contrary to orders by both Guidi and Rankin.

Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan are considering a bill that would rescind funding for foreign aid and public broadcasting. (Alaska Beacon file photos)A group of 23 Alaska state legislators sent a letter to U.S. Sens. Lisa Murkowski and Dan Sullivan, both R-Alaska, on Tuesday urging them to oppose cuts to public broadcasting in a rescission package before the U.S. Senate this week.
The legislators sent the letter hours before the Senate voted to advance the package forward, with Murkowski voting against it and Sullivan voting for it. Vice President JD Vance broke a 50-50 tie to bring the bill forward. A final vote is expected by Friday.
The Republican-led U.S. House voted in June to claw back $9.4 billion in federal funding, with U.S. Rep Nick Begich, R-Alaska, voting for the proposal. The cuts include $1.1 billion for public broadcasting, with more than $20 million in funding for Alaska public radio and television stations. 
The Senate has until Friday to vote on whether to approve or reject the funding reduction, in the rescission package, H.R. 4 — the Rescission Act of 2025. It also includes billions in funding for foreign aid. Congress previously had approved the funding, which covers public broadcasting from October 2025 through September 2027.
The group of state senators and representatives who wrote the letter included 17 Democrats, four independents and two Republicans from across the state. 
“Given that Alaska is a vast and rural state, public broadcasting is integral for the health, safety, and well-being of Alaskans,” they said.  
“In rural areas with limited to no internet access, public broadcasting provides important information during emergencies and natural disasters to help keep Alaskans safe, as well as providing important community information and connection across our state. Public broadcasting also keeps Alaskans connected to their Legislature through programing on Gavel Alaska.”
The letter highlighted the ongoing political debate between Alaska Gov. Mike Dunleavy and the state Legislature, with Dunleavy vetoing state funding for public broadcasting out of the state budget since 2019. 
“That political reality, combined with our current financial shortfalls, mean that the State of Alaska will be unable to backfill the money from federal public broadcasting cuts,” they said. 
While the House proposed $1.2 million for public broadcasting this year, the Senate removed the money. That meant that the Legislature did not include money for public broadcasting in the budget for the first time since Dunleavy became governor, after he vetoed the funding in the previous five budgets.
Legislators said withholding the funding will have minimal effect on the federal deficit, pointing out the bill — with most of the changes to foreign aid — represents 0.13% of the nearly $7 trillion federal operating budget. “While we understand the importance of fiscal responsibility and addressing the federal deficit, these cuts will do more harm than good for public safety and well-being in Alaska.”
Murkowski has been a vocal supporter of public broadcasting, and has promised to do everything she can do to protect the funding. The senator declined to comment or respond to the legislators’ letter through a spokesperson on Tuesday. 
Murkowski spoke on the Senate floor against the bill on Tuesday. “If you don’t like what’s going on within NPR, you think that there’s too much bias there, we can address that,” she said. “But you don’t need to gut the entire Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the entity – the program that provides for so much support, particularly for those in rural places.”
Sullivan has also supported public broadcasting funding, but has also joined congressional Republicans in criticizing National Public Radio as being left-leaning and ideologically biased.
Sullivan spokesperson Amanda Coyne said by email Tuesday evening that the senator had warned public media, including NPR, that “their biased programming and reporting, funded in part by the American taxpayer, would eventually jeopardize federal support for both national and local radio stations,” she said. “For years Senator Sullivan has been an advocate for funding for our rural stations, and has been working for the last number of weeks with his Senate colleagues and senior White House officials on alternative sources of funding to help keep rural radio stations on the air.”
President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold his support or endorsement for any Republican that does not support the rescission package. 
The Senate voted to begin considering the rescission package on Tuesday. It is set to debate and vote on amendments on Wednesday. A final vote could be as soon as Wednesday.
Alaska public media stations have been sounding the alarm on the proposed cuts, especially in rural Alaska, as some stations receive up to 70% of their funding through the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the federal funding agency targeted by the rescission vote. 
Station managers from Kotzebue to Dutch Harbor to Juneau have said that cuts would be devastating, and result in immediate cuts to programs, services and staff layoffs. 
Kristin Hall, interim general manager of Bethel-based KYUK, was among them.
“If Congress decides to defund public media or if these actions dismantle the public media system, KYUK could be forced off-air entirely,” Hall said in a statement. “Leaving our communities without access to free, independent, and reliable information and critical weather, river, and emergency updates. For our station, and for the people of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, this is not just a line item in a budget. It’s our livelihood.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-16 04:01:24+00:00,CT Mirror,Why did Gen Z males shift right?,Julio Duran Davis,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/16/why-did-gen-z-males-shift-right/,Why did Gen Z males make a more conservative shift to the right?,"After the 2024 presidential election, many Americans realized that Gen Z is not as liberal as previously thought. 
What was assumed to be the most progressive, left-leaning generation, voted much more conservative than they did four years ago. This is mainly due to a shift towards the right in young men. But why did this progressive generation make the more conservative shift? There may be an answer that explains a subset of the young male vote: online fitness influencers.
After the 2024 presidential election, I unfollowed a good number of content creators on social media. Many influencers who had been politically vague in the past posted one or two things that made their stance clear, and I made the choice to stop consuming their content. A very large number of these content creators are fitness influencers. There are many young men my age who follow these same people and are not going to stop consuming their content, despite maybe having similar political views to mine.
Most male fitness influencers gear their content toward young men. Most mainstream short form content creators in general make content that is inherently aimed at young people, simply because that is the age group that primarily uses these social media websites. Many fitness influencers are encouraging conservatism and right-wing values in young men through sometimes subtle, sometimes not so subtle messaging. Messaging can start out as something as innocuous as advice on form or exercise, and can become the message that you must always be strong, which can become the message that being gay, or liberal, or anything except a specific caricature of a hypermasculine Republican, is bad and wrong and weak.
This insidious messaging is present within a huge amount of mainstream content creators. It is generally sparsely populated through their content, just enough to get it into the minds of those consuming their videos, but not enough for it to be the main topic of their content. Harmful beliefs and divisive ideas can be created and reinforced in young men who are not even trying to engage with politics, but are looking to the internet for advice and inspiration. They may see these men who they want to look like, and eventually internalize the idea that these enviable, admirable men all share the same political and social views.
Why is it that so many fitness influencers are right wing? Is it because liberals are weak? That is the main point that a lot of these influencers try to perpetuate (pretty successfully). There is no study proving that men who support the idea of equity bench press less than those who don’t. But the culture that has been created around fitness influencing has only made room for one very specific ideology, and doesn’t leave much room for any deviance. It becomes an echo chamber that can be very hard to break into for content creators that hold different views.
This is an issue that is primarily affecting young men, especially high school boys, who are of the age where they are to begin entering society as citizens who can be politically active. They are first time voters. The internet is inarguably a huge part of the lives of most teenagers, and as young men seek physical strength, they will be drawn toward content that focuses on the gym. Because of this culture, an interest in fitness and strength training can very easily lead to right wing ideology and bigotry, even in people who never intended to engage with politics.
Why is this? Doesn’t it seem like a stretch to say that looking at videos about the gym will make you a bigot? Of course it is not that simple, and this is not a universal, inescapable truth. What is true is that male fitness influencers do tend to lean right wing, and if you consume a large amount of content from this group, it will become very easy to internalize the ideas that are being flashed across your screen every single day.
When the COVID-19 pandemic moved Gen Z to online school in elementary, middle, or high school, these kids were also forced to have their social interactions be mainly online. Many parents felt inclined to allow their children to have social media (maybe earlier than they would have otherwise) as a way of accessing social interaction. Thus, these kids were given access to platforms such as TikTok and Instagram at a young age,before they had the media literacy and critical thinking skills they may have learned through growing up or in high school. These kids were exposed to online political propaganda before they even knew what propaganda was. Accepting the internet as the main area for social interaction has had lasting effects on this younger generation, and has made young men especially susceptible to online propaganda that they have been exposed to from a very young age.
When we talk about the Gen Z shift to the right, we need to remember that this is not an ideological change that was made in a vacuum. This generation is constantly barraged with political propaganda, and is not very well equipped to differentiate between fact and fiction.>

Their objective is the destruction of Israel, and once that is accomplished, the transformation of America into something resembling an Islamic Caliphate.  Recently, this endeavor has adopted fire-bombing as its tactic of choice.  Just as Hamas burned to death Israeli babies on October 7, so, too, have their supporters in America attempted the same to an 88 year-old Holocaust survivor in Colorado and to the governor of Pennsylvania, who is Jewish, and his family.
That much of this criminality has occurred on American college campuses is because many who inhabit these campuses – faculty, administrators, and students – either support it or refuse to condemn it.  This, in turn, is because the prevailing ethos in academia reduces the complexities of politics to a crude dichotomy in which everyone who is white is an oppressor of everyone who is not.  Because most Jews in America are white, they are oppressors notwithstanding the long history of anti-Semitism in America. Through this conjunction of white Americans and American Jews, those in academia who accept it hate America for the same reason they hate Israel, the nation-state of the Jewish people. Both, in their view, are irreversibly evil and morally unsalvageable.
On my own campus, Central Connecticut State University, this hatred of all things American and a healthy dose of hostility to Israel are virtually a requirement for graduation.  Although the president of CCSU, Zulma Toro, to her great credit authorized the creation of a committee on anti-Semitism shortly after Hamas began its genocidal war against Israel in 2023, the university requires students to take a course in “Social Justice” – a seemingly neutral term that disguises its real objective.  As expressed on the webpage of the John Lewis Institute of Social Justice, established at CCSU after the George Floyd riots in 2020, it is the extirpation of “inequality and racism in American society.”
The intended result are cadres of graduates committed to making the personal politics of their professors the politics of America.  This is not just a violation of students’ academic freedom, which includes the avoidance of ideological indoctrination.  It is also the consequence of a profound misreading of recent history.  America is not systemically racist.  Nor is Israel an apartheid regime.  It is instead the most tolerant and democratic country in the Middle East.  Homosexuals are thrown from roofs in Gaza and hanged from cranes in Iran.  Israel holds Gay Pride parades.
I cannot overstate the number of students who tell me in confidence and in whispered tones that their professors devote a percentage of their classes to proselytizing students in this left-wing politics that conjoins hatred of Israel and hatred of America. The preferred term for this commingling is “intersectionality.”  In its warped view of reality, it melds the evils of America imperceptibly into the mirage of the “settler colonialism” that ostensibly explains the original sin of the establishment of Israel.
But there is an additional enemy of those in academia who hate Israel and America in equal measure that even their most vocal critics almost always ignore: Western Civilization, to the eradication of which the execrable “Columbia University Apartheid Divest” is explicitly committed. By this one means the civilization of which American politics and culture are both a product and an essential part.  
Among the attributes of Western Civilization that make it different from, indeed preferable, to all others in the world are individual rights, representative democracy, separation of religious and secular authority making religious toleration possible, and a belief in the equality of everyone as creations of God.  It is these virtues that enabled the West, for all its failings, to end slavery, defeat Nazism, weaken Soviet Communism to where its internal contradictions destroyed it, and through an Industrial Revolution provide prosperity to more people than anywhere else and by any other civilization in the world. Indeed, much of what other civilizations have accomplished has been by borrowing all that is best in the West.
Hamas and its supporters are not merely oblivious to this.  They are unalterably hostile to it.
At stake in preventing the globalization of the intifada is nothing less than the survival of Western Civilization.

The hospital celebrated its “Baby Friendly” designation by the World Health Organization and UNICEF in 2004, the year it became only the 40th hospital in the country to earn that distinction, for its intensive work supporting and educating new breastfeeding mothers.
But the possibility that Aquidneck Island’s community hospital could shut down its award-winning labor and delivery unit exists now. And it drew about 200 people to Newport City Hall Tuesday night, including moms with babies and toddlers in tow and people in hospital scrubs. They came to see the Newport City Council pass a resolution advocating for the continued operation of the birthing center where 489 babies were born last year and 318 were born in the first six months of 2025.

“Get ready for a long fight,” Councilor Xaykham “Xay” Khamsyvoravong told the crowd. “We are at the tip of the spear of what is a very long fight to restore community health care and primary health care in the state.”
Khamsyvoravong sponsored the resolution urging the hospital’s owner-operator Brown University Health to maintain the birthing center amid rising financial pressure. Hospital leaders across the country have warned that cuts to Medicaid in the new federal budget could make it harder to maintain childbirth services, which are generally more expensive than routine surgeries and other hospital care.
Newport Hospital spokeswoman Nicole Searles said in a statement Tuesday that Brown University Health is “considering difficult decisions across Brown University Health” as part of its annual budget process with the goal of stabilizing its financial position.
“We take our responsibility to ensure that mothers and babies receive the highest level of care possible very seriously,” Searles added. “That commitment requires strong infrastructure and clinical expertise. At this point, no final decisions about the birthing center have been made, and there have been no immediate changes to our budget, operations, or staffing. We expect to make definitive decisions in the weeks ahead.”

Khamsyvoravong encouraged the crowd in the council chamber to share their stories and reach out to the governor’s office and other officials to make their voices heard.
“Write op-eds, send emails, make phone calls and continue to exert as much pressure as possible to ensure that we save this birthing center today and we work together in the future to fix primary care in this state,” Khamsyvoravong said.
Latisha Michel, a certified doula who addressed the council, warned that if the hospital closed the birthing center, patients without access to personal transportation could face hardships in having to get to hospitals 35 to 45 minutes away.
“Closing it would not only erase a critical piece of our community’s history, but also force birthing people to travel outside of their community at one of the most vulnerable moments in their lives,” Michel said. “If this center closes, people will be left with impossible choices, risk giving birth in transit, being separated from their support systems or face unfamiliar and overstretched hospitals elsewhere.”
The birthing center opened in 1995 and was named in honor of Newport philanthropist Noreen Stonor Drexel in 2003. Drexel, who passed away in 2012, made improving health care and education a primary focus of her work.
“Mrs. Drexel would be terribly betrayed if her dream of the new birthing center and a most generous gift were wasted,” retired health care administrative director and pharmacist Bart Grimes told the council.
Carol Bazarsky, chair of the Newport Hospital Foundation Board of Trustees, turned around at the podium to face the crowd and said she spoke with Brown University Health Chief Operating Officer Sarah Frost about the birthing center. Bazarsky said Frost had emphasized that no decision has been made yet and that the public would be given the opportunity to have their voices heard beforehand.
“There is no question that the birthing center is a viable, beautiful part of our hospital and our community,” Bazarsky said.
Council member Lynn Ceglie was absent from Tuesday’s meeting.

As of 9:43 p.m., Smith Lake realtor Cindy Myrex received 2,129 votes (49.8%) in the GOP primary for House District 12, according to unofficial results from the Alabama Secretary of State’s Office. Cullman City Councilman Clint Hollingsworth received 1,848 votes (43.2%). Heather Doyle, a realtor, and Dan McWhorter, a sales manager, received 3.5% and 3.4%, respectively.
The Secretary of State’s office reported turnout at 12.4%, with 4,276 votes cast. Myrex would need just 10 more votes in the total ballots cast to get the nomination without a runoff.
The campaigns did not have an immediate comment on the results Tuesday evening. Messages seeking comment were left with all four campaigns.
Hollingsworth campaigned on conservative values, expanding broadband access in rural Alabama, small business and mental health. He has served on the Cullman City Council for 17 years.
Myrex, a first-time candidate, planned to run for the seat in the 2026 midterm elections and campaigned on mental health care in public schools and economic growth.
According to campaign finance records, Hollingsworth raised $123,478.34 and spent $107,090.34. Most of his contributions came from individuals, but the SV&B political action committee (PAC) donated to the Hollingsworth campaign multiple times, according to the records.
Myrex raised $124,166.29 and spent $97,484.20. Most of that came from individual donors, with the Alabama Veterans PAC and Farm PAC, the fundraising arm of the Alabama Farmers Federation, according to the records.
Myrex and Hollingsworth will face each other in a runoff on Aug. 12. The winner of the special primary runoff will face Democratic nominee Matt Glover, a 40-year-old parts manager at a poultry plan and former Good Hope City Councilman.
Glover said in an interview Tuesday night he is not surprised that Hollingsworth and Myrex are in a runoff.
“That was where all of the money was going, so seeing that it would be the eventual outcome than one of these two would run,” he said.
The seat opened up after Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April. The district covers part of Cullman County and is solidly Republican.

(Antoinette Grajeda/Arkansas Advocate)The League of Women Voters of Arkansas on Tuesday asked a judge to temporarily block enforcement of several new state laws regulating direct democracy that it argued are unconstitutional. 
The nonpartisan group has proposed for the 2026 ballot a constitutional amendment aimed at preserving the state’s direct democracy process. The League officially began gathering petitions in mid-June, and argued in Tuesday’s court documents that the new laws hinder canvassing efforts.
Direct democracy allows Arkansans to propose new state laws or constitutional amendments and put them to a statewide vote. Arkansas is one of 24 states that permits this process, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.  
The League filed its original lawsuit challenging the laws against Arkansas’ secretary of state in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Arkansas in April. Little Rock attorney David Couch filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction in the case Tuesday evening. 
According to a brief in support of the motion, the deadline for the League to gather the requisite number of signatures is July 6, 2026, but “the Unconstitutional Acts, individually and collectively, so significantly impair Plaintiffs’ ability to gather signatures that the July 6 deadline will likely be impossible to meet.”
Proponents of the new state laws have said they help protect the integrity of the process.
Arkansas group collects signatures for ballot measure, considers working with similar coalition

The plaintiffs argued Tuesday that several of the laws challenged in the lawsuit violate the First Amendment, including three new ones that require canvassers to request a photo ID of potential signers, notify them petition fraud is a criminal offense and have them read the ballot title or have it read to them. 
“These three new laws, individually and collectively, significantly restrict the canvassing process in Arkansas,” the brief states. “They were designed and enacted to interfere with Arkansas citizens’ right to petition by making the process of petitioning significantly more difficult if not outright impossible. They also violate the right to free speech, burdening an open discussion of political issues.”
Plaintiffs will suffer irreparable harm without an injunction, according to court documents. 
“Their injuries cannot be compensated by damages — a lost vote is a lost vote and disqualified signature means that citizens of Arkansas have lost the opportunity to present political issues to the electorate — and there is no other way to restore this Constitutional right other than by enjoining the Unconstitutional Acts,” the brief states. 
Protect AR Rights is another coalition pursuing its own direct democracy-related ballot measure. The group’s proposal has not yet been certified by Attorney General Tim Griffin, but the coalition has filed a motion to intervene in the League’s lawsuit challenging the new state laws. 
Protect AR Rights is seeking to challenge additional laws not listed in the League’s lawsuit, including one that prohibits ballot titles from being written above an eighth-grade reading level. Griffin has cited this law twice in his rejection of the group’s proposal. 
Spokesperson Bill Kopsky has previously told the Advocate that if the judge rejects the motion to intervene, the coalition would file its own lawsuit. 
Members of both groups acknowledged earlier this month that their greatest chance of achieving their shared goal is by working together and said they plan to meet to discuss what that might look like.

Free.,"US Senate Republicans advance bill stripping funds from NPR, PBS, foreign aid",Jennifer Shutt,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-senate-republicans-advance-bill-stripping-funds-npr-pbs-foreign-aid,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate on Tuesday night moved one step closer to canceling $9 billion in previously approved funding for several foreign aid programs and public broadcasting after GOP leaders addressed some objections.Nearly all the chamber’s Republicans voted to begin debate on the bill, though Maine’s Susan Collins, Kentucky’s Mitch McConnell and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski opposed the procedural step along with every Democrat.The 51-50 vote marked a significant moment for President Donald Trump’s rescissions request, which faced more headwinds in the Senate than in the House. Vice President JD Vance cast the tie-breaking vote.Trump proposed doing away with $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting that lawmakers had approved for the next two fiscal years as well as $8.3 billion from several foreign aid accounts.The Corporation for Public Broadcasting provides funding to National Public Radio, the Public Broadcasting Service and local media stations throughout the country.Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., said before the vote that some of the progress stemmed from removing a spending cut for the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR, a global health program to combat HIV/AIDS launched by former President George W. Bush.“There was a lot of interest among our members in doing something on the PEPFAR issue and that’s reflected in the substitute,” Thune said. “And we hope that if we can get this across the finish line in the Senate that the House would accept that one small modification.”South Dakota Republican Sen. Mike Rounds, who had raised concerns about cutting funding for rural public broadcasting stations run by tribal communities, announced a few hours before the vote he’d reached an agreement with the White House.“We wanted to make sure tribal broadcast services in South Dakota continued to operate which provide potentially lifesaving emergency alerts,” Rounds wrote in a social media post. “We worked with the Trump administration to find Green New Deal money that could be reallocated to continue grants to tribal radio stations without interruption.”Rounds said during a brief interview that $9.4 million will be transferred from an account within the Interior Department directly to 28 Native American radio stations in nine states.“I had concerns specifically about the impact on these radio stations that are in rural areas with people that have basically very few other resources, and to me, they got caught in the crossfire on public broadcasting,” Rounds said. “And so I just wanted to get it fixed and I was successful in getting it fixed.”White House budget director Russ Vought told reporters after a closed-door lunch meeting with Republican senators that he didn’t want to get “too far ahead” of discussions, but that his office was working with GOP senators to ensure certain local broadcast stations “have the opportunity to continue to do their early warning system and local reporting.”Maine’s Collins wants more detailsSenate Appropriations Chairwoman Collins, who voiced reservations about several of the rescissions during a June hearing, said preserving full funding for PEPFAR represented “progress.”But Collins said a few hours before the vote she still wants more details from the White House budget office about the exact source of the other $9 billion in cuts to previously approved spending.“One of the issues, which I raised at lunch, is the total is still $9 billion and it's unclear to me how you get to $9 billion, because he's listed a number of programs he wants to, quote, protect,” Collins said, referring to Vought. “So we still have the problem of not having detailed account information from OMB.”Collins, R-Maine, then held up a printed version of the 1992 rescissions request that President George H.W. Bush sent Congress, which she said was “extremely detailed” and listed each account.“I would contrast that to the message that we got for this rescission, which just has a paragraph and doesn't tell you how it's broken down in each program,” Collins said, adding she’s still “considering the options.”The Senate’s procedural vote began a maximum of 10 hours of debate that will be followed by a marathon amendment voting session that could rework the bill. A final passage vote could take place as soon as Wednesday.Trump expected to send more requestsThe House approved the legislation in June, but the measure will have to go back across the Capitol for a final vote since the Senate is expected to make changes.The effort to cancel funding that Congress previously approved in bipartisan government funding bills began last month when the Trump administration sent Congress this rescission request.The initiative, led by White House budget director Vought, is part of Republicans’ ongoing efforts to reduce federal spending, which totaled $6.8 trillion during the last full fiscal year.Vought expects to send lawmakers additional rescissions proposals in the months ahead, though he hasn’t said publicly when or what funding he’ll request Congress eliminate.Once the White House submits a rescission request, it can legally freeze funding on those accounts for 45 days while Congress debates whether to approve, amend, or ignore the proposal.Johnson slams funding for public mediaHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said during a press conference before the PEPFAR removal was announced that he hoped the Senate didn’t change the bill at all.“I’ve urged them, as I always do, to please keep the product unamended because we have a narrow margin and we’ve got to pass it,” Johnson said. “But we’re going to process whatever they send us whenever they send (it to) us and I'm hopeful that it will be soon.”Johnson said canceling the previously approved funding on some foreign aid programs and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting represented “low-hanging fruit.”Federal funding for public media, Johnson said, embodied a “misuse of taxpayer dollars” on organizations that produce “biased reporting.”“While at its origination NPR and PBS might have made some sense, and maybe it does now,” Johnson said. “But it shouldn’t be subsidized by taxpayers.”Trump has also sought to encourage Republican senators to pass the bill without making any significant changes.“It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING (PBS and NPR), which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,” Trump wrote on social media last week. “Any Republican that votes to allow this monstrosity to continue broadcasting will not have my support or Endorsement. Thank you for your attention to this matter!”",,,,2025-07-15 22:06:07.894176

Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) at an energy and tech summit Tuesday, July 15, 2025 in Pittsburgh. (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Pennsylvania has the natural resources, workforce, talent and industrial might to lead America in the artificial intelligence race, U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick (R-Pa.) and executives in the energy, tech and investment sectors said Tuesday. 
They announced more than $90 billion in investments in the commonwealth’s energy generating assets, data centers, and workforce development at a Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit hosted by McCormick.
President Donald Trump attended the summit Tuesday afternoon at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, where he joined business leaders in a discussion with several members of his cabinet.
“Today, the commonwealth is reclaiming its industrial heritage and taking its place at the forefront of the AI technological revolution,” Trump said.
The Budget Reconciliation Act Trump signed on July 4 repeals sections of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act that provided incentives for renewable energy and energy efficiency, which critics have said will eliminate cost-saving opportunities for consumers and increase reliance on fossil fuels. 
Last week, Trump issued an executive order that directed Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to eliminate tax credits for wind and solar power projects and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum to find and do away with regulations and policies that give preference to wind and solar energy. 
  Sen. Dave McCormick hosted a Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit with President Donald Trump on Tuesday, July 15, 2025, at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
“I ended the green new scam,” Trump said, using a derisive nickname for a broad range of energy and economic policy goals to advance renewable energy. He then falsely claimed the Biden administration had caused further decline in the already fading coal industry. 
“I also ended [former President] Joe Biden’s war on clean, beautiful Pennsylvania coal. Totally ended,” he said.
The use of coal diminished over decades as somewhat cleaner oil and plentiful natural gas replaced it.
Trump also touted an executive order  issued in May reforming the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which he said would allow Pittsburgh-based Westinghouse to move forward with the construction of 10 new nuclear reactors. The company said the projects would support 15,000 new jobs and generate $6 billion economic activity.
That’s one of the 20 projects McCormick highlighted in the summit. Others include a $3 billion deal between Google and investment firm Brookfield to repower two 1930s-era hydroelectric dams on the Susquehanna River; a $3.4 billion project by Constellation Energy to increase the output of its nuclear power plant near Limerick, Montgomery County; and a $25 billion investment by asset manager Blackstone in power generation, data center and infrastructure development in northeast Pennsylvania.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
McCormick told the Capital-Star the summit itself served as a catalyst for the projects.
“We said, ‘Listen, we’d love an opportunity to put you on a national stage to talk about the importance of Pennsylvania. Can you accelerate and finish?’ And that’s what’s happened,” he said. 
With the announcements by publicly traded companies Tuesday, McCormick said he’s confident that the investments will materialize.
“You have commitments on what it’s going to mean in terms of labor and jobs,” McCormick said. “They’re going to do that in front of the entire community, in front of the president of the United States … So I’m pretty confident they’ve been working at this, in some cases, for a long time.”
Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro has also promoted the opportunities presented by the global effort to perfect artificial intelligence as a labor-multipling technology while promoting his own plan to capitalize on the commonwealth’s natural resources and existing energy infrastructure.
Last month, Shapiro announced Amazon Web Services had inked a $20 billion deal to build two data center campuses in Luzerne County adjacent to the nuclear fueled Susquehanna Steam Electric Station and in Bucks County on land formerly used by U.S. Steel.

Shapiro joined McCormick and AWS CEO Matt Garman in a panel discussion moderated by Penn State President Neeli Bendapudi.
Shapiro told reporters at the summit that his administration would work closely with the companies that announced projects to make sure they could get shovels in the ground. 
“It’s important that these companies be on the record for what they want to invest, and then it’s critically important that they actually make the investments, and we’re going … to hold them to the commitments that they make,” he said. 
Since taking office 2023, Shapiro has also emphasized the need to streamline government permitting and other processes crucial to developing new industries. Executives at the summit said speed is possibly the most important in developing AI projects and the energy resources they need. 
Shapiro told the Capital-Star that moving fast doesn’t mean compromising public health or safety. 
“I think if anything, we’re doing a better job on public health and safety than ever before,” he said. “We’re just moving really, really quickly. So when we can promise speed and transparency in that process, that protects the public interest and it creates economic opportunity.”
Garman said that when AWS was looking for places to make investments Pennsylvania rose to the challenge. 
“Number one, the infrastructure here is great,” Garman said. “There’s fantastic talent, and that’s another really key piece of it, is that we need people to help us go and build there.”
A common theme among the promised investments is the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in the construction trades and operating and maintaining facilities. Speakers stressed the need for educational investment to ensure Pennsylvanians have skills the companies need.
AI tech firm Anthropic said it will inject $1 million in cyber security education for middle and high school students and provide an equal amount to CMU for energy research. And the Energy Innovation Center in Pittsburgh announced it would build a first-of-its-kind regional training facility for energy and AI infrastructure workers. 
In another panel, Mike Rowe, the host of Discovery Channel’s “Dirty Jobs” and the founder of a nonprofit that supports vocational education, said those jobs would be an opportunity to reach young people who feel left behind.
“We’ve been telling kids for 15 years to learn to code,” Rowe said. Yeah, well, AI is coming for them. They’re not coming for the welders. They’re not coming from the plumbers. They’re not coming from the steam fitters or the pipe fitters or the HVAC. They’re not coming from the electricians.”

(Capital-Star/Peter Hall)With Independence Hall in Philadelphia serving as the backdrop, a group announced on Tuesday they have filed a petition asking the state Supreme Court to rule primary election laws in Pennsylvania are unconstitutional.
“We’re speaking to the seven justices of the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and we aim to convince them that excluding independent voters from primary elections is not just unfair in some vague, moral sense, but that it violates the Pennsylvania Constitution,” said David Thornburgh, chairman of Ballot PA Action, a coalition aimed at overturning the state’s closed primary laws.
Thornburgh, along with Michael Smerconish, a longtime political television and radio host, Jeffery Doty, an owner of a grocery store, and Rachel Shanok, a physical therapist, filed a King’s Bench Petition, which goes directly to the state highest court.
Pennsylvania, home to approximately 1.4 million people registered as independent, unaffiliated, or members of a third party, is one of at least nine states that doesn’t allow independent voters to participate in primary elections. That means to cast a ballot in a party’s primary, a voter must be registered with that particular political party.
“If we are successful, then the current statute will be declared unconstitutional, and therefore it will be non-functional, and that will mean immediately that independents can vote in party primaries,” said Shanin Specter, co-founding Partner, Kline & Specter PC, the legal firm representing the group. “Republican, Democratic, Green, Constitution, Libertarian, whatever.”
“The legislature would be free to fashion other potential schemes with respect to voting, but such a scheme would have to protect the right of Independents to vote in primary elections, and…that’s the core of what we’re seeking,” Specter added. 
He also noted that 15% of the state’s electorate are registered independents in Pennsylvania. In 1937, when this law was enacted, that number was just 3%.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Reinforcing the point, Smerconish, a Republican-turned-Independent, cited a Gallup poll that said 43% of Americans self-identify as Independent.
“When independents can’t vote in primary elections, I think that we all suffer because our missing voice is often one of moderation,” Smerconish said. “We live in very polarizing times and I firmly believe that when independent voices are excluded from the nomination process, we foster a rise of extremes at both ends of the political spectrum.”
“And better would be a system that forces candidates to have to appeal to a broader cross-section of primary voters, including those from whom compromise is not a dirty word,” he added.
Voter turnout in Pennsylvania appeared to be lower in 2025 than the previous two off-year municipal primary elections. Supporters of reforming the state’s primary laws believe opening up them to registered independents will increase voter turnout.
Jeremy Gruber is the senior vice president of Open Primaries, a national election reform organization dedicated to opening primary elections around the country to independent voters. He said the voting population of 14 states is less than the total number of registered independent voters in Pennsylvania. 
He argued it’s a voting rights crisis that independents aren’t allowed to vote in primaries.
“Today, the largest and fastest group of voters are being discriminated against and excluded by these primaries,” Gruber said. “This case filed today follows a long history of litigation: From women’s suffrage through the Civil Rights era, to the modern day, the history of voting rights in the United States is intertwined with litigation, which has served as a crucial catalyst in the evolution of legislation by highlighting discriminatory practices and spurring reform.”
“Almost every voting rights reform ever passed in this country started with a case just like this one,” he added.
Why a King’s Bench Petition?
By filing a King’s Bench petition, the group is able to bypass the normal course of litigation through the lower courts.
“Ultimately, it has to be the Pennsylvania Supreme Court who makes the decision to declare unconstitutional the current statute, and for that reason, there’s no reason to wait,” Specter said. “There’s no reason to have a lower court decide the issue first, the case will be decided eventually in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, and they should do so as quickly as possible.”
Specter acknowledged that the state Supreme Court could decline to accept the King’s Bench petition, which would then result in them filing the action in the Commonwealth Court. He said the losing side would “doubtlessly appeal,” and he believes that there is a “very, very, very, high chance” that the justices would accept that appeal. 
It is unclear how quickly a ruling could be made.

A supporter of open primaries announces opposition to petition
The Committee of Seventy, a government reform group, has been a leading voice in Pennsylvania advocating for the state to end its closed primary elections.
However, they find themselves opposed to the effort of making this change via a King’s Bench petition, arguing while it is “well intended,” it is the “wrong approach to address this longstanding issue at this moment.”
“All voters should have the opportunity to participate in all elections, but making that a reality is in the hands of the legislature,” The Committee of Seventy released in a statement on Tuesday.  “We fully respect the rule of law and the separation of powers established by our constitutions.” 
Thornburgh, who led the organization for several years but stepped aside as CEO in 2022, argued that they’ve worked on the issue for six-and-a-half years and now is the right time to move forward. He also noted that they are asking the court to rule on its constitutionality, and it would ultimately go back to the legislature, if they agree.
“And the legislature could choose any number of ways to solve the problem, if you will,” Thornburgh said. 
Open Primary Author calls lawsuit “historic”
State Rep. Jared Solomon (D-Philadelphia) has authored legislation that would allow unaffiliated voters to participate in either the Democratic or Republican primary, but would not allow third-party voters. He released a statement in support of the lawsuit.
“As one of the last states in the country with closed primaries, opening up our primary election system is the voting rights issue of our time here in Pennsylvania,” said Solomon. “This historic lawsuit takes seriously this fundamental right to vote, and gives voice to the 1.4 million Pennsylvania voters whose tax dollars pay for elections they are shut out of.”",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/DSC_7466-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-15 22:06:07.894176

(Photo by Michael Salerno/Rhode Island Current)Neil Steinberg is stepping down from his role as head of the quasi-public Rhode Island Life Science Hub after less than two years in the voluntary role. 
The former head of the Rhode Island Foundation, the state’s largest nonprofit, Steinberg will leave his role before the end of September, according to a resignation letter he sent to Gov. Dan McKee and other state leaders on Tuesday.
“Given the SUBSTANTIAL time I have invested in the past few years, and the solid foundation now established, I am willing to make this resignation effective on a day of your choosing, but not later than September 30, 2025,” Steinberg wrote in his letter. 
Steinberg cited furthering his work in other areas of public life that are “aligned with [his] interests and experience, including public education, healthcare and housing.”
“Two years into my retirement from the Rhode Island Foundation, I would like to spend more time with family and traveling,” Steinberg wrote in the letter.
The Rhode Island Life Science Hub was created in 2023 with $45 million in federal American Rescue Plan funds. Enabling legislation driven by House Speaker K. Joseph Shekarchi and supported by McKee outlined the state laws that guide the hub’s operation. Per those state laws, McKee will need to appoint a new board chair, a pick which will be subject to Senate approval. Steinberg’s replacement will serve out the remainder of his term, which was slated to end on Jan. 1, 2028.
Steinberg helped spearhead the legislation that led to the hub’s creation. The hub is meant to nurture and support the biotech industry in Rhode Island. Steinberg was confirmed as the inaugural board chair in January 2024.
Dr. Mark A. Turco, who was confirmed as the initial president and CEO of the Hub late last year, thanked Steinberg for his time with the hub in a LinkedIn post on the agency’s profile Tuesday.
“Through Neil’s support the Hub organization was successful in hosting an Inaugural Summit, launching several grant programs, the establishment of Ocean State Labs, a 30,000 square foot life science incubator, and supporting the manufacturing expansion of Organogenesis into Rhode Island,” Turco wrote. “These accomplishments laid a strong foundation for positioning Rhode Island’s growth and strategic role in advancing the life science sector locally and abroad. We are grateful for the insight, vision, and passion Neil brought to this role.”
Turco added that he was “confident” the existing board and staff would be able to continue the hub’s mission to fortify the biotech sector in Rhode Island.
McKee also issued a statement Tuesday evening, thanking Steinberg for serving as the first chair of the hub. 
“His dedication helped us establish a strong foundation for this growing industry, supporting efforts like our administration’s work to bring Organogenesis —a major, job-creating company — to Rhode Island,” McKee wrote. “We’re excited to build on that momentum with Hub President Dr. Mark Turco and the board as we continue expanding opportunities in life sciences and strengthening Rhode Island’s economy.”

The failure to reach an agreement before the previous contract expired left about 90,000 people in central Missouri unable to obtain services except at the higher out-of-network cost. In a statement issued late Tuesday, Dr. Stevan Whitt, chief medical officer at MU Heath, said the agreement applies retroactively to April 1.
“The renewed partnership ensures continued access to quality, local care while protecting affordability for the people and communities both organizations serve,” Whitt said.
The Missouri Consolidated Health Care Plan, which covers state workers and some local government employees, said the agreement reopens health care options to its covered population.
“We recognize the impact this may have had on you and your family, and MCHCP worked diligently to encourage an agreement between MU Health Care and Anthem,” the statement read. “Our leadership team met with both Anthem and MU Health Care to express the urgency of completing an agreement and remained in regular contact with them to emphasize how much their dispute affected our members.”
State Senate President Cindy O’Laughlin became upset with the impasse and asked for the hearing, which took place June 30. After the hearing, she posted on social media that both sides met privately later and progress was possible.
“Suffice it to say people are paying more through their deductibles and co-pays and for those who are challenged with severe health issues the situation we addressed today has made everything worse,” she wrote.
In a joint news release, MU Health and Anthem said the new agreement covers all providers and facilities and is in-network for Anthem’s commercial health plan members and those who have individual marketplace plans.
The new agreement will not include Anthem’s Medicare Advantage HMO and PPO plans, the release said.
“Anthem remains committed to protecting access to care while ensuring affordability for our members,” Stephanie Vojicic, president of Anthem, said in the release. “We’re pleased that both parties have come together with a shared commitment to our communities and a renewed focus on doing what’s right for the people we serve.”

(John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)MACY, Nebraska — The Omaha Tribe of Nebraska became the first government in Nebraska on Tuesday to fully legalize and seek to regulate both medicinal and adult recreational-use cannabis.
The Omaha Tribe of Nebraska announced the “historic” decision Tuesday, announcing a unanimous vote of the Omaha Tribal Council that it said in a statement positions the tribe as a “trailblazer” in state cannabis reform. The approval also seeks to have the Omaha Tribe reclaim its “rightful place as a leader in regional governance and economic innovation.”
“The Omaha Tribe is not waiting on broken systems to deliver,” Omaha Tribe of Nebraska Attorney General John Cartier said in a statement. “We are asserting our sovereign right to govern, protect our community and build a sustainable economy that reflects our values.”
The law immediately took effect Tuesday.
‘Creating real opportunity’
The new Title 51 Cannabis Control Code of the Omaha Tribal Code establishes extensive licensing, advertising, testing, enforcement, education, seed-to-sale tracking and other requirements, according to a copy shared with the Nebraska Examiner. 
The law states the cannabis plant has been on the continent for centuries and that Indigenous people have long used plant-based substances for healing, spiritual and ceremonial purposes, the code states. Tribal leaders hope to generate revenue and create employment while investing in health, education, housing and infrastructure.

Cartier said the new tribal law expunges prior cannabis offenses that would now be legal, with a “robust social equity framework” meant to repair harms of past criminalization.
Tribal sovereignty is a focal point in advancing these changes. The code explicitly states that any attempt by state or local authorities to try to assert jurisdiction over lawful tribal licensees or cannabis activity on tribal lands would be considered a violation of tribal sovereignty. 
If necessary, the tribe will pursue legal remedies to uphold its sovereignty.
“This is not just about cannabis,” Omaha Tribal Chairman Jason Sheridan said in a statement. “It’s about creating real opportunity for our people, asserting our sovereignty and showing the region what tribal leadership looks like.” 
‘Comprehensive and forward-looking’
Among the code’s components is creating the Omaha Cannabis Regulatory Commission, a commission of at least three members and up to five, with flexibility for more if needed. 
Up to 1 ounce of cannabis for adults 21 and older is legalized to be possessed or purchased on Omaha Tribe lands, unless a different amount is approved by the regulatory commission.

The commission could create incentives for tribal members or set different possession and purchase limits depending on whether someone is a member of the Omaha Tribe.
Tribal leaders approved excise taxes on cannabis products of up to a 15% retail excise tax on the gross sales price to consumers and up to a 5% wholesale or transfer tax on the fair market value of products transferred between licensees or from producers to retailers.
Under the law, a portion of cannabis tax revenue can be allocated to support low-income patients or to establish a Cannabis Patient Access Fund. The commission will prioritize patients who are tribal members with chronic or life-limiting conditions; youth, elders and veterans in need of compassionate care and patients underserved by state or federal systems.
The new Tribal Code says the aim of Title 51 is to:

Protect the health, safety and welfare of tribal members and reservation residents.
Promote sustainable tribal economic development and self-sufficiency.
Ensure effective oversight of cannabis activity through tribal regulation consistent with federal law, including the Controlled Substances Act, the 2018 Farm Bill and relevant Department of Justice guidance.
Affirm the tribe’s sovereign rights to regulate trade, health, taxation, land use and commerce in a manner consistent with Umóⁿhoⁿ culture and governance

“Title 51 is the most comprehensive and forward-looking cannabis code in the region, that is rooted in our traditions and designed for our future,” Cartier said Tuesday.
Differences to state regulations
Cartier, speaking to the Examiner, confirmed the tribe’s desire to change the code on cannabis for at least a decade. Now in month three as the tribe’s attorney general, Cartier said this project was among the first he was tasked with, given his background in cannabis law.
Like state advocates of medical cannabis are seeking to do with the voter-created Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission, Cartier said the tribal regulatory commission hopes to borrow the best components of other medical and recreational cannabis programs in other tribal nations or states in crafting its own.

The tribe’s Omaha Cannabis Regulatory Commission will establish and maintain a confidential registry of qualifying patients diagnosed with commission-identified qualifying conditions, a flexible list that will be determined by tribal medical authorities or the commission. 
Cartier will serve as the legal adviser to the tribe’s regulatory commission in a nonvoting role. At least two commission members must be members of the Omaha Tribe, and non-tribe members must possess “demonstrated expertise in areas critical to cannabis regulations.”
The tribal commission will prioritize licensing of and support for tribal members, enterprises and Omaha-owned businesses.
Under state law, medical cannabis that will soon be legal to sell in Nebraska can’t be taxed by local or state governments, and no new fees can be assessed against medical cannabis establishments or patients.
In Nebraska as a whole, longtime state advocates successfully petitioned the government last November to legalize up to 5 ounces of medical cannabis with a health care practitioner’s recommendation. 
More than 71% of voters agreed on legalization, and about 67% supported a state regulatory system.
‘The tribe is ready to lead’
However, the rollout of legal marijuana businesses in the state has been slow, and the state regulatory commission has been “mired in litigation threats, regulatory confusion and bureaucratic delay,” according to the tribe’s news release.
Among state legal threats is the Nebraska Attorney General’s Office, which intends to sue the Nebraska Medical Cannabis Commission as soon as it begins licensing establishments. The commission must begin doing so no later than Oct. 1, under state law.

The Nebraska AG’s Office had no comment Tuesday on the Omaha Tribe’s action.
Cartier said state leaders have been “dragging their feet” on the business side and that the tribe’s decision marks a “great contrast” to those actions.
“What the tribe has done is we’ve come forward and said, ‘We’ll fill that void. We’ll provide that leadership and that forward thinking,’” Cartier said. “It’s no secret that state lawmakers, state officials at the top here, despite overwhelming public approval, have unreasonable opinions towards cannabis and prohibition and whether or not that’s the right choice for Nebraska.”
Title 51 will go through a phased rollout beginning this year, first with licensing, compliance and a public education campaign.
Cartier said the Omaha Tribe also welcomes collaboration with health care providers, patients and business leaders so long as tribal law and sovereignty are respected.
“The tribe is ready to lead,” Cartier said. “The time to act is now.”

State Rep. Lindsay James, D-Dubuque, said Tuesday she is considering a run for the 2nd District. The 44-year-old Presbyterian pastor, currently serving her 4th term in the Iowa House, said she is discussing with her family whether to run and speaking with people in the northeast Iowa district.

As James considers a bid for the seat, another Democrat, Kathy Dolter, has entered the race. Dolter, former dean of nursing at Kirkwood Community College and a retired Army nurse, said in an interview Tuesday that she was motivated to run because of the cuts to public health made through the federal budget reconciliation bill and by the Trump administration.
Having worked in education and the health care profession, Dolter said she wants to bring her experience as a health care professional and educator to Congress and be a part of the Democratic effort to flip Congress and stop or reverse these changes.
She said she believes she would be the best choice for Iowans as someone who has significant accomplishments outside of politics — like founding the nursing program at the University of Dubuque and graduate nursing program at Mount Mercy University, as well as working with the Army Surgeon General and Department of Defense to implement a new health program and guidelines for people serving in the military.
“I bring a lot of experience and a lot of can-do, and a lot of actual accomplishments,” Dolter said. “… I’m not a politician, but I would work hard. I’m a hard worker, and would want to get things done to to help Iowans.”
Iowa GOP Chairman Jeff Kaufmann called Dolter a “radical far-left political activist with Soros-ties” in a Tuesday statement, saying she was “no match” for Republican incumbent Rep. Ashley Hinson in the 2026 election.
“We are confident that once Iowans get to know her, they will reject her just like Kevin Techau – that is if she doesn’t drop out first,” Kaufmann said. “Welcome to the big leagues, Kathy!”
Kevin Techau, former Iowa commissioner of public safety, had also launched a run to become the Democratic nominee for the congressional seat in April, but suspended his campaign in June because of funding shortfalls.
Dolter said in response to Kaufmann’s statement she does not believe “name-calling” is appropriate.
“I am an American who served her country in many ways and has taken care of patients and taken care of students and taken care of Iowans,” Dolter said. “So, no. I’ll put my record up against his any day.”
Hinson had been widely expected to run for reelection, but her name has recently been mentioned in Iowa and nationally as a potential candidate for U.S. Senate. Incumbent Republican Joni Ernst has not formally announced a reelection campaign, leading to speculation that she might not seek a third term.
While the 2nd District is considered by political forecasters as less competitive than Iowa’s 1st and 3rd Districts, the area was recently represented by former U.S. Rep. Abby Finkenauer, a Democrat who won in 2018 and lost to Hinson in the 2020 election. Hinson won reelection in the 2022 and 2024 against Democratic challengers.
James argues Iowans are ‘exhausted’ by GOP agenda
James argued the district will be competitive in the upcoming 2026 election, saying people in the district are “exhausted” by the choices made by leaders in Congress.
“I have been traveling across the district hearing from folks across the district, and the system is not working for the majority of Iowans,” James said. “We need a change of leadership. I would argue that this district is highly competitive, because … (voters) want people who will go fight for them, who will make sure that they can afford a house and, send their young children to child care, make sure that they have food on the table and a safe working place — there’s so many important issues. For the majority of Iowans, those needs are not being met.”
If she pursues a run for Congress, James said, she would focus on a platform that tackles the “economic realities” Iowans are currently facing, like low wages, high costs of housing and child care, and decreased funding for public education. James said Hinson is not talking about these issues in Congress, and that measures supported by the Iowa Republican — like the “big beautiful bill” that included cuts to Medicaid and other public assistance programs — will hurt Iowans, especially in rural areas.
“People are very clear that Hinson has stopped listening to Iowans,” James said. “They have felt left behind when it comes to the policies that she’s passing.”

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Two North Dakota tribes and a group of tribal citizens have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to keep North Dakota’s district map in place while it considers whether to review a voting discrimination lawsuit against the state.
The Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa, Spirit Lake Nation and three tribal members filed suit against North Dakota over a 2021 redistricting map they say diluted the power of Indigenous voters in violation of the federal Voting Rights Act.
North Dakota U.S. District Court Judge Peter Welte in 2023 concluded the map is discriminatory and ordered the state to adopt different district lines, but the 8th Circuit reversed his decision in May. The appellate court’s ruling found that private citizens have no means of filing lawsuits under the Voting Rights Act to challenge racially discriminatory voting practices. The 8th Circuit indicated it would send the case back to Welte and direct him to dismiss the lawsuit.
The plaintiffs are getting ready to ask the Supreme Court to review the lawsuit. On Tuesday, they requested that the court allow Welte’s map to stay in place until a final decision in the case is reached.
The plaintiffs said in court filings they could suffer lasting harm if the 2021 map is allowed to go back into effect.
North Dakota tribes want US Supreme Court to hear voting rights case

The May decision, in tandem with other recent rulings by the court, has made the 8th Circuit the only circuit in the country where private citizens and organizations cannot bring lawsuits under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which outlaws voting practices that discriminate based on race. The 8th Circuit has determined that it’s the role of the U.S. attorney general to enforce Section 2.
The plaintiffs dispute the 8th Circuit’s findings and say that Congress always intended for private citizens to be able to bring legal challenges under the provision. The appellate court has removed an important tool Native Americans use to protect their voting rights, the plaintiffs wrote in a Tuesday filing with the U.S. Supreme Court.
“North Dakota — like many states — has a long and sad history of official discrimination against Native Americans that persists to this day,” the plaintiffs stated. “Tribal Nations and individual Native American voters have successfully fought for decades to vindicate their voting rights under Section 2.”
Over the past several decades, most lawsuits filed under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act have been brought by private groups and not the U.S. Department of Justice, they noted.
The results of the 2024 election also indicate that Welte’s map made an important difference to Indigenous voters in District 9, they added.
In 2024, after Welte’s ruling, three Native American lawmakers were elected to the state Legislature from District 9, drawn to include two reservations: Sen. Richard Marcellais and Rep. Jayme Davis — both citizens of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa — and Rep. Collette Brown, a citizen of the Spirit Lake Nation and plaintiff in the lawsuit. All three are Democrats. 
“The fair map we secured led to a historic first — a Spirit Lake Nation member elected to the North Dakota legislature,” Spirit Lake Nation Chairperson Lonna Jackson-Street previously said in a statement about the 8th Circuit’s ruling. 
Three North Dakota lawmakers would no longer live in the districts they represent if the 2021 map goes back into place, including Brown.
Court denies rehearing voting rights case; group calls decision ‘loss for Native American voters’

Attorneys for the North Dakota Legislature have said it’s not clear whether those lawmakers would be able to serve out the remainder of their terms or if they would be subject to removal from office. That means Brown could lose her seat if the 8th Circuit’s judgment goes into effect, the plaintiffs wrote in their filing with the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The map imposed by Welte remains in effect for now, though the 8th Circuit is expected to issue its mandate lifting a hold on the 2021 map this week, notwithstanding any intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, said Mark Gaber, a Campaign Legal Center attorney representing the plaintiffs.
The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the state to file its response to the plaintiffs’ motion by July 22. North Dakota has maintained that the 2021 map is not discriminatory and that it agrees with the 8th Circuit’s finding that the tribes lack standing to sue.
Last week, the plaintiffs asked for a similar stay from the 8th Circuit, though the court declined.
It’s very rare for the U.S. Supreme Court to agree to take a case, though the plaintiffs are hopeful the justices will hear the lawsuit to resolve the split between the circuits.
“This is the country’s most important civil rights statute, so I think the odds are high that they’ll take it,” Gaber said Tuesday. The plaintiffs’ deadline to officially petition the high court to review the lawsuit is in October, he added.
The 8th Circuit includes North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Nebraska and Arkansas.

17 communities across Massachusetts have already banned nicotine sales for individuals born after a certain year. Now lawmakers are considering whether to adopt the policy statewide. 
The post Mass. lawmakers weigh a statewide age-based nicotine ban appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","MASSACHUSETTS LAWMAKERS ON Monday heard heated testimony on a bill that would institute a statewide ban on nicotine sales to anyone born after a certain year – a policy that 17 communities across the state have already adopted.  
The Nicotine Free Generation bill – filed by Rep. Tommy Vitolo of Brookline and Sen. Jason Lewis of Winchester – would outlaw the sale of tobacco products to anyone born after January 1, 2006.  
Proponents said it will keep the next generation from becoming addicted to products known to be harmful, while opponents argued that it would limit consumer choice and hurt small convenience stores.  
Brookline was the first community in Massachusetts to enact a nicotine-free generation policy, banning tobacco and nicotine sales to anyone born after January 1, 2000. Retailers challenged the law, but the Supreme Judicial Court upheld it, giving the policy a green light statewide. 
The policy has since been adopted in 16 more cities and other towns: Belchertown, Chelsea, Concord, Conway, Hopkinton, Malden, Manchester-by-the-Sea, Melrose, Needham, Newton, Pelham, Reading, Somerville, Stoneham, Wakefield, and Winchester.  
Bhavika Kalia, a rising junior at Somerville High School, made an impassioned case to lawmakers to pass the bill at the hearing of the Joint Committee on Public Health.  
“This isn’t just policy to me; this is personal; it’s about my friends, my classmates, my peers,” said Kalia. “It’s about what I see every single day in the schools you represent: students vaping in the bathrooms between classes, friends who tried it once or twice because it seemed harmless, and now they can’t stop.” 
Those opposing the bill said it was infantilizing adults in the name of public health.  
“These proposals are discriminatory, anti-consumer choice, anti-small business, and unnecessary in light of existing Massachusetts law,” said Ryan Kearney, vice president of the Retailers Association of Massachusetts. “The proposals are nothing more than an attempt at prohibition, which has failed in the area of alcohol, cannabis, and sports betting, and it will not work for nicotine products. What it will do is disadvantage Massachusetts merchants,” said Kearney, who said consumers will not only simply buy nicotine products out of state but purchase other products there, too, that they would otherwise have bought at a Massachusetts convenience store.  
Several physicians testified in favor of the generational ban, citing the health effects of nicotine use that they are already seeing in the youth they treat.  
“[I] take care of hundreds of kids who are coughing up sputum, experience shortness of breath, can no longer keep up on the field, lose weight due to nausea and vomiting, develop mental health complications, and have disrupted sleep as a direct result of vaping,” said Dr. Alicia Casey, a pediatric lung doctor at Boston Children’s Hospital. “These products are creating small and large disruptions in their everyday lives. These are your constituents, and we are failing in Massachusetts to protect them and their lungs.” 
The committee also heard testimony on bills that would move in the opposite direction. One bill would ban local health boards from being able to enact nicotine-free generation policies on the municipal level – reversing the bans in the 17 communities that have passed them. Another would reverse a statewide ban on flavored tobacco products. Massachusetts banned flavored tobacco products, including menthol cigarettes – which many said were particularly targeted at children – in 2020.  
“These [generational ban] bills are illiberal and the movement behind them is performing as opposed to practical,” said Alex Weatherall, the owner of a gas station convenience store in Sherborn. “I say illiberal because they propose to direct how adults live their lives. I say performative because while they’re sure to have no positive effect on public health, they do satisfy a desire of nannying policy makers to feel useful.” 
Massachusetts was the first state in the nation to institute a flavored tobacco ban, and those pushing the nicotine-free generation appealed to lawmakers to lead in the same way on the nicotine-free generation policy. 
“I do not want my friends to be addicted to products that are going to kill them, and I do not want my friends to die because we aren’t doing enough to stop billion-dollar corporations from targeting them,” said Isabel Tashie, a rising senior at Needham High School.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)A federal grand jury indicted Vance Boelter on six felony charges related to the killings of Minnesota Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, and the shooting of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman, in the early morning hours of June 14.
The U.S. Department of Justice filed the initial charges on June 15, the day Boelter was arrested outside of Green Isle after a two-day manhunt. After charging someone with a felony through a complaint signed by a judge, the DOJ must present evidence to a grand jury in order to formalize the charges.
The charges in the indictment were revised to include an allegation that Boelter shot at Hope Hoffman, the daughter of John and Yvette Hoffman. The bullets narrowly missed Hope, and she immediately called 911 to report the shooting, according to an unsealed application for a search warrant.

The indictment includes two counts of stalking Melissa Hortman and John Hoffman; two counts of murder in the killings of Melissa and Mark Hortman; and two firearms offenses in the shootings of the Hortmans and John and Yvette Hoffman, and the attempted shooting of Hope Hoffman.
The indictment also contains a “notice of special findings,” the first step in seeking the death penalty, said acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Joe Thompson in a press conference Tuesday. Prosecutors have not yet made a decision on whether to seek the death penalty, and that decision will be up to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, DOJ officials and the victims, Thompson said.
The search warrant application provides some details of the crime that were not included in the original charging documents, including the full text of a letter found in Boelter’s car that contains fantastical ravings about his motives that are replete with disinformation. The letter contradicts other writings found in his cars and home, which indicated he sought out politicians, abortion rights advocates and abortion providers.
“Was it a delusion that he believes, or was it a delusion that is designed as an effort to misdirect our investigation or to, frankly, excuse his crimes?” Thompson said of the letter. “That’s a good question. It certainly seems designed to excuse his crimes.”
The documents also clarify the sequence of events at the Hortmans’ home that night.
According to the search warrant: Mark Hortman answered the door when Vance Boelter knocked, announcing himself as a police officer. Boelter and Mark Hortman spoke for a few moments, then Brooklyn Park police pulled up to the house to perform a welfare check. Immediately after, Boelter shot Mark Hortman several times, then entered the house and shot Melissa Hortman and their dog, Gilbert.
A camera located near Boelter’s temporary residence in north Minneapolis showed Boelter wearing a rain coat with the hood up at around 7 p.m. on June 13, the night before the killings, apparently placing a duffel bag and body armor in his SUV.
Later that evening — hours before the shootings — cameras at the Hortman home captured a man in a rain coat with the hood up walking around the side and back of the yard.

Joe Raedle/Getty ImagesA special House committee focused on elections kicked off its first meeting at the state Capitol Tuesday, as state lawmakers gathered to solicit testimony from elections officials and activists on how to improve Georgia elections.
The committee, tagged as a “blue ribbon” panel, aims to evaluate Georgia’s current election policies and provide recommendations for new election laws ahead of Georgia’s 2026 legislative session. It is chaired by state Rep. Tim Fleming, a Covington Republican, who recently became the first candidate to launch a bid for secretary of state.
Georgia’s election system has been under immense scrutiny since the 2020 election, when President Donald Trump falsely stated that the ​​election was stolen from him in Georgia and several other swing states. The current secretary of state, Republican Brad Raffensperger, resisted pressure from Trump to overturn Georgia’s election results in his favor. 
In the years since, the Republican-controlled state Legislature and State Election Board have sought to strip power from the office, removing Raffensperger from his former position as chair of the State Election Board before ousting him from the board altogether. The Trump-aligned State Election Board has also been deluged by activists urging them to implement sweeping changes they say will boost confidence in the outcome of the elections, including mandatory ballot hand-counts and the elimination of voting machines.

In his opening remarks, Fleming also emphasized the need to restore public confidence in Georgia’s elections.
“The legitimacy of our government — local, state and federal — rests squarely on the public’s trust in the electoral process,” he said. “That trust must be earned and maintained through transparency, consistency and integrity at every level, from the precincts in our neighborhoods to the local election superintendent’s offices and counties, to the Secretary of State’s office here in Atlanta.”
Raffensperger, who was first elected as the state’s top election official in 2018, has not said what his plans are for next year. 
During its six scheduled meetings, the committee plans to evaluate the role that the secretary of state’s office and the State Election Board play in overseeing elections across the state, Fleming added. 
Though the committee has not yet indicated which changes they would like to see enacted, legislation introduced during the 2025 legislative session may offer some clues. Earlier this year, Fleming authored a controversial election bill that would prohibit Georgia from sharing voter information with third-party groups like the Electronic Registration Information Center, limit voters’ ability to drop off absentee ballots on the final weekend before Election Day and expand poll-watching areas, among other provisions. The bill, HB 397, successfully passed through both chambers, but failed to gain final passage before the Legislature adjourned. 
Those provisions may be among those considered by the committee as they compile their official recommendations for the 2026 session. Other study committees scheduled to meet this summer will examine artificial intelligence, insurance rate hikes and medical marijuana policies.
The next meeting of the elections committee is slated for Aug. 8 in Rockmart, Georgia.

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)In the 19 years my uncle has worked in the healthcare industry, he’s only missed one day — the day his mother, my grandmother, passed away. He would then help plan a funeral he couldn’t attend.
If you live in his small town in Utah, you know my uncle. He’s the big man you see on a bike riding all over town. He’s part of the kitchen staff at a care facility and a friend to the other workers and patients. He’s the man who has the bus schedule memorized and can get you anywhere.
He’s also the man who was forced to miss his mother’s funeral in his home country. His immigration status requires him to apply for travel authorization, which can take months and puts him at risk of being denied reentry. Unfortunately, it just wasn’t possible for him to make it.
Stories like these are all too common. And they could soon get worse.
My uncle has what’s called Temporary Protected Status, or TPS. TPS was created by Congress in 1990 to provide work authorization and protection from deportation to individuals from designated countries enduring armed conflict or environmental disasters.
Over a million people rely on the program. While it’s characterized as temporary, over 200,000 TPS holders have lived here for more than two decades. They’ve established lives here, yet live with the fear that it could be taken away at any moment.
Unfortunately, that moment has arrived.
President Trump and Secretary of Homeland Security Kristi Noem have made it clear that they’re coming for TPS. The administration has carelessly terminated or rescinded the legal status of hundreds of thousands of TPS holders, needlessly uprooting their lives.
These deported TPS holders are now expected to navigate poverty, instability, violence, and other unsafe conditions in countries many haven’t lived in for decades. Many struggle to reintegrate after their return, and are often targeted by local criminal groups.
While the administration slanders TPS holders as criminals, an overwhelming amount of research shows that immigrants actually make our communities safer. They have a nearly 95 percent employment rate and generate over $1.3 billion in federal taxes, contributing to programs like Social Security and Medicare. With a high rate of entrepreneurship, they generate a spending power of more than $8 billion.
Their positive impact is undeniable. Yet instead of providing a pathway to citizenship, the Trump administration is systematically phasing out TPS and imposing significant financial hardship on TPS holders and their communities.
In addition to deeply slashing programs like SNAP to fund tax benefits for the wealthy, Trump and the GOP’s “Big Beautiful Bill” also adds exorbitant new fees for immigrants with TPS, asylum seekers, and migrants on humanitarian parole. The new law increases initial application fees for TPS holders from $50 to $500 and adds a non-waivable $550 fee for work authorization for first-time applicants — along with a new annual renewal fee of at least $275.
My uncle has already paid thousands of dollars in renewal fees during his 20 years as a TPS recipient, saving the money needed from his $16 an hour job to continue to work and provide for his family. Because my uncle loves this country, he’ll pay these predatory fees.
But he shouldn’t have to — and neither should anyone else on TPS. Our communities are better because TPS holders are here. Their livelihoods are in jeopardy unless Congress provides them a pathway to citizenship.
The American Dream and Promise Act would provide TPS holders — along with DACA recipients and other undocumented youth — a pathway to citizenship, along with the permanent relief and stability they and their families deserve.
As the niece of one of the one million-plus TPS holders, I urge you to defend the rights of your neighbors. Now is the time to protect what makes our communities so great.",https://utahnewsdispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/No-Kings-SLC_SH_10-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 20:10:44.305373

“As our state continues to grow and thrive, the approval of this comprehensive plan helps to ensure we have the resources and programs we need to reliably and economically meet the future energy needs of our customers,” said Georgia Power CEO Kim Greene in a statement.
The plan predicts skyrocketing growth in energy demand, mostly due to data centers, and lays out how the utility will meet it, through a mix of building new power plants and upgrading old ones. The plan extends two coal plants beyond their previously proposed closure dates, a controversial move because of coal’s intensive greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. It also approves updates to existing nuclear reactors, hydroelectric plants and transmission lines.
Before seeking bids for new resources — a process due to start in October — Georgia Power will need to refine its forecast and provide regular updates on growing demand. The company’s projections on demand were a major point of contention throughout the proceedings, with critics arguing it overestimates how much energy new customers like data centers will actually need and how quickly that demand will come.
“With unprecedented grid growth ahead for Georgia, this Integrated Resource Plan puts us on the right path to meet everyone’s needs,” said commissioner Tim Echols in a statement. “I wish it had more solar, more storage, more energy efficiency — but it strikes a good compromise in the spirit of collaboration.”
The most strident objections to the agreement came from consumer advocates who felt that the energy efficiency provisions violated a previous commission order.
In 2023, those advocates signed on to a settlement agreement that raised power rates to pay for construction costs at Plant Vogtle, in exchange for an expansion of a senior discount program and an increase in energy efficiency savings. While the utility initially proposed an energy efficiency target that matched the Vogtle deal, the agreement approved Tuesday falls short of that amount.
“This is an incredible blow to Georgia Power’s credibility and the credibility of the IRP process,” said Codi Norred, executive director of Georgia Interfaith Power and Light, one of the advocacy groups that signed the Vogtle agreement, in a statement. “I can’t see how anyone would come to the negotiation table with Georgia Power in good faith again after witnessing the bait and switch the company just pulled off with the commission’s blessing.”
Echols expressed the same concern in a hearing last week, but ultimately voted for the agreement without proposing any changes.
Georgia Power and the commission’s staff maintain they did not violate the Vogtle agreement, which said only that the utility would “propose and support” the higher efficiency goal, known as a DSM savings target, and allowed that commission staff could advocate for a different figure. In a filing last week, the utility argued the new deal “still results in one of the highest DSM savings targets to be approved in recent history, and certainly better than what may have occurred if the Vogtle Prudence Stipulation had not been approved by this Commission.”
“Georgia Power fulfilled its obligations under the Vogtle Prudence Stipulation and no reasonable interpretation of that document could determine otherwise,” that filing read.",https://georgiarecorder.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_5972.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 20:10:44.305373

A man was reportedly acting erratically under a town bridge. When police moved to arrest him, he fired a handgun at officers who returned fire, police say.
The post Worland police shoot and kill armed man; one officer wounded appeared first on WyoFile .","Officers shot and killed a man who was reportedly acting erratically under a Worland bridge after he fired a handgun at them Monday evening when they tried to arrest him, the Worland Police Department reported the following day. 
One officer sustained a non life-threatening gunshot wound during the encounter, Worland Police Chief Gabe Elliot wrote in a statement posted Tuesday to the department’s Facebook page. The unidentified officer was hospitalized but released the same day, Elliot wrote. 
The statement did not specify whether the man killed by police was the person who fired the shot that hit the officer. Nor did it offer details about the officer’s injuries.
Elliot did not respond Tuesday afternoon to a WyoFile voicemail seeking further information.
Officers responded to the New River Bridge, an access point to Worland over the Bighorn River, at 6:45 p.m. Monday, after someone reported a man yelling and kicking his belongings around in an area under the bridge, according to Elliot’s Facebook post. Elliot described the man as 37 years old and declined to name him. 
In a separate press release issued Tuesday, the Wyoming Division of Criminal Investigation announced it would conduct an inquiry into the shooting and asked witnesses or people with surveillance cameras in the area to contact the department.
Responding officers found the man standing by his vehicle, but when he saw police approaching he got back in, Elliot wrote. The man later complied with a request to exit his car and talk to officers. A supervising officer – neither Elliot nor DCI named the responding officers – who came onto the scene recognized the man as being a suspect from an investigation into a property crime earlier that day.
The supervisor told officers to arrest the man, according to Elliot. “The male physically resisted arrest as he began to fight with the officers,” the chief wrote. The man appears to have been able to hold off officers attempting an arrest and “produced a handgun,” which he then fired at officers. Neither Elliot nor DCI’s press release states how many shots the man fired. 
There were four Worland police officers on scene, and two of them returned fire, according to Elliot’s press release. They shot the man, who died at the scene. Those two officers are on administrative leave, Elliot wrote. That’s a common response after police shootings regardless of what party was at fault.
Elliot’s social media post does not mention whether the officers’ bodyworn cameras captured the shooting, or when such footage would be released. (Police bodycam footage is not a mandated public record in Wyoming.) DCI’s press release states that investigators will analyze digital evidence, as well as physical evidence from the scene, but it does not specify what evidence was available. It is common practice in Wyoming for DCI agents to investigate police shootings around the state. The agency has developed an investigative group to respond to such incidents. 
DCI’s report is then provided to a county prosecutor, whether that’s the district attorney of the county where the incident occurs or a special prosecutor brought in from the outside.
That attorney then makes the decision about whether officers’ use of force was justified, or if the responding officers might face any criminal charges.

(Photo by Austin Fisher / Source NM)The New Mexico Supreme Court on Tuesday issued three rulings dealing with time limits on criminal charges, what kinds of structures can be burgled and whether union contracts limit someone’s ability to seek whistleblower protections.
The Supreme Court unanimously ruled that the New Mexico Court of Appeals was right to set aside embezzlement charges against former Taxation and Revenue Secretary Demesia Padilla.
Padilla, who was a cabinet secretary under Gov. Susana Martinez, resigned in 2016. State prosecutors in June 2018 charged her with embezzling money from one of her accounting firm’s clients in between 2011 and 2013; however, a district court threw out the charges because they were filed in the wrong place.
A grand jury in Sandoval County indicted Padilla in August 2019, and the district court there allowed the case to move forward, ruling that the time limit for filing criminal charges had been put on pause during the year between the initial charges being dismissed and the indictment.
The appeals court reversed, saying the part of the law that pauses the statute of limitations doesn’t apply to Padilla’s case. The Supreme Court’s ruling affirms that reversal, because the Sandoval County indictment happened more than six months after the time limit expired.
A majority of the Supreme Court tossed out felony murder and aggravated battery convictions of Joseph Matthew Gregory Jones for shooting and killing a Santa Fe homeowner in his backyard in 2018.
Felony murder is a second-degree murder that is raised to first-degree murder when the defendant commits the killing while committing or trying to commit another felony.
Four of the five justices concluded that since the covered patio attached to the back of the home is not a structure that could be burglarized, there was no underlying felony to elevate the homicide charge against Jones to felony murder.
Chief Justice David Thomson disagreed with the majority and wrote that the homeowner, like any reasonable person, would expect their porch to offer them some privacy from intruders.
Since the reversal is based on a trial error and not an acquittal, prosecutors could still retry Jones, the majority wrote.
The justices unanimously sided with a state worker who filed a lawsuit under the state Whistleblower Protection Act against what used to be called the New Mexico Human Services Department and is now the Health Care Authority.
Frederick Garcia alleged that the state agency demoted him in retaliation for testifying in a lawsuit that department employees had falsified documents.
The justices ruled that the collective bargaining agreement between Garcia’s union and the agency did not preclude him from filing the whistleblower lawsuit.
They also rejected the state’s argument that pursuing internal arbitration over the demotion waived his right to file the complaint under the whistleblower law.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)A federal grand jury indicted Vance Boelter on six felony charges related to the killings of Minnesota Speaker Emerita Melissa Hortman and her husband Mark Hortman, and the shooting of state Sen. John Hoffman and his wife Yvette Hoffman, in the early morning hours of June 14.
The U.S. Department of Justice filed the initial charges on June 15, the day Boelter was arrested outside of Green Isle after a two-day manhunt. After charging someone with a felony through a complaint signed by a judge, the DOJ must present evidence to a grand jury in order to formalize the charges.
The charges in the indictment were revised to include an allegation that Boelter shot at Hope Hoffman, the daughter of John and Yvette Hoffman. The bullets narrowly missed Hope, and she immediately called 911 to report the shooting, according to an unsealed application for a search warrant.
The indictment includes two counts of stalking Melissa Hortman and John Hoffman; two counts of murder in the killings of Melissa and Mark Hortman; and two firearms offenses in the shootings of the Hortmans and John and Yvette Hoffman, and the attempted shooting of Hope Hoffman. 
The indictment also contains a “notice of special findings,” the first step in seeking the death penalty, said acting U.S. Attorney for Minnesota Joe Thompson in a press conference Tuesday. Prosecutors have not yet made a decision on whether to seek the death penalty, and that decision will be up to U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, DOJ officials and the victims, Thompson said. 
The search warrant application provides some details of the crime that were not included in the original charging documents, including the full text of a letter found in Boelter’s car that contains fantastical ravings about his motives that are replete with disinformation. The letter contradicts other writings found in his cars and home, which indicated he sought out politicians, abortion rights advocates and abortion providers.
“Was it a delusion that he believes, or was it a delusion that is designed as an effort to misdirect our investigation or to, frankly, excuse his crimes?” Thompson said of the letter. “That’s a good question. It certainly seems designed to excuse his crimes.”
The documents also clarify the sequence of events at the Hortmans’ home that night.
According to the search warrant: Mark Hortman answered the door when Vance Boelter knocked, announcing himself as a police officer. Boelter and Mark Hortman spoke for a few moments, then Brooklyn Park police pulled up to the house to perform a welfare check. Immediately after, Boelter shot Mark Hortman several times, then entered the house and shot Melissa Hortman and their dog, Gilbert.
A camera located near Boelter’s temporary residence in north Minneapolis showed Boelter wearing a rain coat with the hood up at around 7 p.m. on June 13, the night before the killings, apparently placing a duffel bag and body armor in his SUV. 
Later that evening — hours before the shootings — cameras at the Hortman home captured a man in a rain coat with the hood up walking around the side and back of the yard.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/GettyImages-2219605928.jpg,,,2025-07-15 19:11:43.336451

Kevin Stitt speaks during a forum with Jenks High School students at the Jenks Public Schools Math and Science Center on Nov. 13, 2024. (Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY – The Oklahoma Supreme Court late Tuesday put on hold a law that would create the state’s first business court system.
The action came after the full court earlier in the day heard a challenge to the constitutionality of Senate Bill 632.
During oral arguments, justices appeared skeptical about the legality of the measure, which was to become effective Sept. 1 and was strongly supported by Gov. Kevin Stitt. 
Senate Bill 632 creates business courts in Tulsa and Oklahoma City, but critics said it violates a constitutional provision allowing Oklahomans to vote on retaining judges and because the $1,500 filing fee bars access to the courts.
Justice Noma Gurich questioned whether it would take a vote of the people to amend the Oklahoma Constitution to create business courts rather than legislative action.
She also asked if portions of the bill could be removed to make it constitutional.
Justice Douglas L. Combs asked if the measure was disenfranchising voters.
Attorneys Joe E. White Jr. and Jason Waddell, who sued Stitt, asked the court to put the law on hold and to toss it out as an unconstitutional bill.
The men had argued in their court filing that the emergency injunction was necessary because the House Speaker was expected to submit nominees for the first two judges and it would be unfair to ask anyone to give up their positions in the event the law is ultimately overturned. State leaders were also expected to begin leasing space and hiring staff for the courts.
“The Court assumes original jurisdiction for the purpose of issuing a temporary stay pending the litigation herein,” the order said, adding that the measure can’t be enforced until a future order. The vote was 6-3.
Bob Burke, representing the two attorneys, said that because the measure lets the governor appoint the two judges, it violates a constitutional provision allowing voters to vote on district and associate judges. The measure says the business court judges shall serve an 8-year term and could be reappointed.
“My biggest gripe about this bill is that it deprives us of the ability to vote,” Burke said.
The business court judges would be subject to the whims of the governor and Legislature, Burke said.
He said it is an impermissible special law because it treats certain people differently, and it would result in different treatment for two people in the same county depending on the amount of money in dispute.
Business courts would handle matters that involve at least $500,000.
The measure requires the House Speaker to submit three names to the governor for appointment. The Senate would vote to confirm the selection.
Currently, the Judicial Nominating Commission submits names for judicial vacancies to the governor. Senate confirmation is not required. The judges run on a nonpartisan ballot.
The jurisdiction of the business courts is so broad that it is unworkable, Waddell said during oral arguments.
The bill creates unlimited power for the governor to appoint judges without a way for voters to remove them through an election, he said.
“What they want is a judge who is hand picked to rule the way they want,” Waddell said.
Supporters of the measure touted it as a way to lure business to the state.
Audrey Weaver, Gov. Kevin Stitt’s deputy general counsel, told the court not to take the case, saying no one has sustained injury.
White and Waddell were not the proper parties to file suit.
Weaver said the Oklahoma Supreme Court does not issue advisory opinions or rule on speculation or hypotheticals.
She said the court needed to exercise “judicial restraint.”
Benjamin Lepak, Stitt’s general counsel, said the case was before the court because critics of the bill lost a policy battle at the Legislature.
Lepak said the measure expands access to the courts.
The $1,500 filing fee is reasonable and in line with that of other states, Lepak said.
“This lawsuit is a textbook example of attorneys trying to use the courts to block progress,” Stitt said in a press release. “They have no actual injury, no client affected by the law, and no standing to be here.”

BURLINGTON – On a hot Tuesday, several people stopped for food and water by tables set up in a tree-shaded spot on Church Street at the entrance of City Hall Park.
A longtime volunteer-run free lunch program, Food Not Cops, served an estimated 50 to 75 people by 1:45 p.m. with brioche, peanut butter, kale salad and kale chips, fried plantains, white beans, pizza and more.
Running quietly out of the Marketplace Garage for years, the effort received more public attention this year after 150 area businesses signed on to a letter alleging the operation in the garage “has had a negative impact on the area” and asking that it “be relocated to a more appropriate and secure setting—not eliminated.”
That led to a counter letter signed by dozens of organizations and businesses expressing support for the meal program, followed by a protest outside City Hall before the May 20 City Council meeting. Sam Bliss, one of the organizers of the lunch program, further wrote an op-ed stating that Food Not Cops makes downtown safer.
Amid intense debate, Progressive Mayor Emma Mulvaney-Stanak signed a resolution last month allocating $10,000 to support relocation of the effort “to a more accessible and better-resourced location.”

The money has not yet been claimed, however, and the City Council-imposed deadline for the mayor to come up with a proposal for relocation passed Monday. Meanwhile, volunteers two weeks ago relocated the mutual aid effort to the park downtown on Church Street. 
Whether that is a better or worse location depends on who you ask. 
Some who came for lunch Tuesday said they like the visibility that makes the free food more accessible to those who didn’t know about the program. Others said the central location makes them uncomfortable, pointing to heavy police presence in the park.
“I just think it’s a lot better here because there’s a lot of people who didn’t know about it before,” said Amberina Gonzolas, who stopped for a bite there.

Originally from Puerto Rico and in Vermont for 12 years, Gonzolas said, “I like that people like me who have issues with the state (such as access to food stamps) can get free food.”
A social worker and volunteer since 2022, who declined to be named without her employer’s knowledge, said she used to come from St. Albans to eat at the Food Not Cops lunch. 
She said it’s unfortunate there is police scrutiny over a free food distribution program, a basic necessity. “It keeps a lot of people away now that there’s this social barrier, so we are thinking of moving again,” she said.
There were three police officers and two community service officers in the vicinity Tuesday. At least two arrests were made in the park during the last half hour of the 1-2 p.m. lunch distribution. Volunteers weren’t sure if they were among those who came for the lunch program.
“We have not directed staff to increase patrols in response to the food distribution program,” Shawn Burke, the city’s interim police chief, wrote in a brief email. “We have been providing a strong presence in the park, and the downtown in general, since April.”
At Monday’s City Council meeting, organizer Brian Clifford from Essex said he didn’t want the mutual aid service to become a fight between the group and the city.
“So I know we’ve arrived at sort of an awkward situation here, but I’m hoping that the city can take this as an opportunity to recognize our legal rights to do our little daily anti-capitalist and abolitionist protest in public places, and just to back away from the idea that you can decide where we go without respecting our consent and agency,” he said.
Mulvaney-Stanak, who has been engaged in talks with Food Not Cops since last October, wrote in her June 3 memo that she is looking to find “a mutually beneficial path forward” and that “the insistence upon placing a deadline on these efforts has only hindered our ability to make progress.”
She plans to continue to engage with the volunteers while considering the needs of all who enjoy City Hall Park, she said this week.
“The administration is committed to supporting people accessing food in our City given the high number of community members living with food insecurity, while also remaining committed to everyone being able to access and safely use public spaces,” her July 14 memo states.

(Photo by Jerry Holt/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photo)The prosecution and defense in the felony burglary trial of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, made opening statements Tuesday, but the most influential moments for jurors may wind up being the imperfect memory of the case’s key witness: Carol Mitchell, stepmother of the accused and owner of the home allegedly burgled.
Nicole Mitchell has pleaded not guilty to first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools, after police say she broke into her stepmother’s home on April 22, 2024.
Nicole Mitchell has said her stepmother suffers from Alzheimer’s, and after not hearing from her for weeks, was conducting a welfare check.
Carole Mitchell struggled to recall basic information throughout her testimony Tuesday.
Becker County Attorney Brian McDonald began his direct examination of Carol Mitchell by asking her what year she met Nicole Mitchell’s father, Roderick.
“I’m bad at that,” Carol Mitchell said, referring to her struggle with specific dates.
Nicole Mitchell’s father Roderick Mitchell died in 2023. When McDonald asked Carole Mitchell what year he died, Carol Mitchell said that he “passed in 1983 — 1993.” After a lunch break, Carol Mitchell was asked again, and she said he died in 2023.
She couldn’t remember the names of Nicole Mitchell’s sons — her step-grandsons — who Mitchell’s attorney says have spent significant time with Carol Mitchell.
Carol Mitchell is a 75-year-old retired graphic designer who has long grey-brown hair and glasses.
Several of the jurors appeared visibly uncomfortable during the prosecutor’s direct examination of Carol Mitchell. Some furrowed their brows when McDonald attempted to jog Carol Mitchell’s memory about how often Nicole Mitchell would visit her Detroit Lakes home or the names of Nicole Mitchell’s two sons.
Carol Mitchell is the only witness who can personally attest that she didn’t invite Nicole Mitchell to her Detroit Lakes home, and that Nicole Mitchell’s presence was unwelcome. Her inability to recall specific dates, names and events could undermine her credibility.
On April 22, 2024, Carol Mitchell called the police — after Nicole Mitchell was arrested and the officers had left — to inform them that she found a blue crowbar near the window Nicole Mitchell allegedly used to break into the home. The crowbar is a key piece of evidence for the burglary tools charge.
McDonald presented Carol Mitchell with the crowbar Tuesday, which appeared to be a small prybar, and asked her if she recognized it.
“No,” Carol Mitchell replied. The one she found “was much larger than that. A light lavender color,” she said. Body cam footage later revealed that the prybar was bright blue and less than a foot long.
Carol Mitchell told McDonald that the police “pulled the person out of the egress window” and later called her to tell her that the person was Nicole Mitchell. This testimony was incorrect, however, according to police. Nicole Mitchell was found by police in the basement bathroom.
Carol Mitchell was present for the arrest, according to body cam footage, and when Nicole Mitchell addressed her — “Carol, it’s Nicole” — Carol Mitchell said, “It’s Nicole?” in a surprised tone. Carol Mitchell during the arrest told police that Nicole Mitchell and her aunts wanted to steal her money.
Bruce Ringstrom Jr., Mitchell’s attorney, was gentle in his cross examination of Carol Mitchell, telling her to take her time and that it was okay if she couldn’t remember something.
Ringstrom asked Carol Mitchell whether she had told police that “I feel like she (Nicole Mitchell) wants to take me out.”
Carol Mitchell said she did tell police that because she thought the person who was in her bedroom was looking for the pistol she kept there, and she thought the person on the bedroom floor was “planning to shoot me.”
The defense’s cross examination of Carol Mitchell made her appear like a sympathetic, elderly woman who was suffering from Alzheimer’s-related paranoia and had an imperfect memory about an event that startled and disturbed her.

Body cam footage
McDonald showed the jury several body cam videos, including two that were each 40 minutes long, from cameras worn by the officers who were on the scene during the arrest.
When the first officer arrived on the scene that night, he walked past Carol Mitchell, who was wearing a white bathrobe, and went into the basement.
The footage showed Nicole Mitchell, dressed in a black stocking hat with her braid tucked into it, a black shirt, black leggings and black socks. The footage showed her come out of the basement bathroom with her hands up. Officers told her to get on the ground on her stomach. They handcuffed her on the ground.
Carol Mitchell could be seen on the basement stairs watching the arrest. Nicole Mitchell identified herself to Carol, who told Nicole, “You had your aunts do it” and told police “She’s trying to get my money.” Nicole Mitchell said she didn’t steal anything and nothing was on her.
Throughout the video footage and her arrest, Nicole Mitchell told police that Carol Mitchell has severe Alzheimer’s and that she was paranoid — remarks that were left out of the criminal complaint by police.
She told police that Carol Mitchell has gotten progressively more paranoid. When Becker County Deputy Sheriff Ethan Wothe was questioning Nicole Mitchell, she offered to show text messages evidencing the paranoid delusions.
Wothe responded: “It’s not a reason to break into anybody’s house,” according to the body cam footage shown in court.
“I don’t know if it means anything but she’s a state senator,” Wothe told another officer on the scene.
Wothe interviewed Carol Mitchell, who said she believed Nicole Mitchell broke into her house looking for a “tin box” that contained legal and bank documents.
Carol Mitchell testified on Tuesday that she believed Nicole Mitchell stole her laptop — the prosecution and defense agree that Nicole Mitchell did not steal her laptop — and that someone was trying to get money out of her account. Carol Mitchell said her bank had notified her that someone was trying to get into her account. Because of that, she said she believed Nicole Mitchell was after her money.

Opening statements
Carol Mitchell’s apparent confusion may not be enough to save her stepdaughter from a conviction, however, especially given the statements Nicole Mitchell made to police on the night of the arrest.
“‘I know I did something bad.’ These were some of the many words of Sen. Nicole Mitchell in the early morning hours of April 22, 2024,” McDonald began in his opening statement to the jury.
McDonald told the 14-member jury that Nicole Mitchell broke into a basement window, wearing all black and “her own words make it clear that she was there to take items, and under the law, that is all there’s required to prove burglary — unlawful entry with the intent to commit a crime inside.”
McDonald in his 10-minute opening statement told the jurors that Nicole Mitchell’s reason for being in the home doesn’t matter.
“When the judge instructs you on the law in this case, you’ll learn that any ‘why’ won’t amount to a legal excuse. That is because no amount of grief or frustration can justify a home break in,” McDonald said.
In Ringstrom’s opening statement, he offered a defense of Nicole Mitchell the public hasn’t heard.
Ringstrom said Nicole Mitchell had a key to the Detroit Lakes home, but Carol Mitchell had started barricading the doors. Nicole Mitchell had seen signs of Carol Mitchell’s decline, so she wanted to take action to ascertain her condition and get her help, he said.
Nicole Mitchell parked on a side street. She made a point to drive to the house when it was still dark outside, wearing dark clothing.
“When you’re checking on a paranoid loved one and hoping they don’t notice, you take great pains to leave unnoticed,” Ringstrom said.
Ringstrom said the defense wouldn’t dispute that she entered without permission. Nicole Mitchell would’ve pleaded guilty to a trespassing charge, he said. But what matters is her intent, and Mitchell entered the home to check on Carol Mitchell, Ringstrom argued, not to steal.
On Tuesday morning, the judge informed the prosecution and defense that one of the jurors selected Monday had been excused because of health reasons. The jury panel now includes 10 men and four women in a county that voted for President Donald Trump last year by 33 percentage points.

Kelly Ayotte speaks to reporters on Wednesday, April 9, 2025. (Photo by William Skipworth/New Hampshire Bulletin)Gov. Kelly Ayotte vetoed seven bills Tuesday, many of which were intended to strengthen parental rights, bucking the conservative wing of her party over hotly contested legislation.
In one action, Ayotte vetoed a bill intended to make it easier for parents and guardians to remove “obscene” books and materials from schools. House Bill 324 would require school boards to create a complaint process for parents and guardians to object to school material deemed harmful to minors. That material could include books, movies, photographs, printed and digital material, plays, and other content.
The governor also vetoed House Bill 148, which would allow businesses and organizations to separate people by biological gender in bathrooms, locker rooms, athletic events, and settings such as jails and mental health facilities.
She vetoed House Bill 358, which would make it easier for parents to apply for religious exemptions to child vaccine requirements in school; House Bill 446, which would require schools to get explicit parental permission before giving students non-academic surveys; and House Bill 667, which would require sex education courses to include “a high quality computer generated animation or ultrasound video that shows the development of the heart, brain, and other vital organs in early fetal development.” 
Ayotte also vetoed House Bill 475, which would require the alternative “default budget” option at town meeting to cut spending for unfilled town positions, arguing it would make it harder to recruit and retain town positions. And she vetoed House Bill 115, the bill to create a continuing resolution for the budget in case lawmakers failed to pass a budget; that bill proved to be unnecessary. 
The vetoes will require a two-thirds majority in both the House and Senate to overturn, a difficult bar in the House, where Republicans do not hold a veto-proof majority.
And they represent some of Ayotte’s most public — and politically fraught — clashes with Republican lawmakers, many of whom had hoped their stronger House and Senate majorities would lead to victories for socially conservative priorities. 
School book removal bill quashed
One of the most closely watched bills vetoed by Ayotte Tuesday would have required public schools to adopt complaint procedures to allow parents to object to, and potentially remove, material deemed harmful from schools. 
According to HB 324, such material would be considered harmful if it depicted “nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sadomasochistic abuse” and did so “in a manner that is patently offensive to prevailing standards in the adult community with respect to what is suitable for minors,” the bill states. The material would also need to be inappropriate to the age level of the children it is presented to and to “serious literary, scientific, medical, artistic, or political value for minors.” 
Sponsored by Rep. Glenn Cordelli, a Tuftonboro Republican, HB 324 was championed by parental rights advocates as a means to give parents more control over school instruction and to remove graphic depictions of sexual activity. Earlier this year, Cordelli attempted to illustrate that point by reading aloud on the House floor portions of a novel describing sexual assault. 
But opponents of the legislation said it could lead to the removal of books that include LGTBQ+ representation and allow one parent to make decisions for all students over what should be included. And teachers unions objected to potential professional consequences for educators laid out in the bill.
In her veto message, Ayotte noted that state law already allows parents to opt their child out of instructional material they object to, as long as they provide an alternative material. 
“Current state law appears to provide a mechanism for parents through their local school district to exercise their rights to ensure their children are not exposed to inappropriate materials,” Ayotte said. “Therefore, I do not believe the State of New Hampshire needs to, nor should it, engage in the role of addressing questions of literary value and appropriateness, particularly where the system created by House Bill 324 calls for monetary penalties based on subjective standards.” 
Under the required policy in HB 324, parents and guardians could submit written complaints to school principals describing the material allegedly harmful to minors. The principal would be required to conduct an investigation and decide whether the material is in violation and should be removed. 
According to the policy, the school would have 10 school days to inform parents of their decision. If parents disagree, they can appeal the decision to the local school board and, ultimately, to the State Board of Education, which has the final say.
That provision drew opposition from the New Hampshire School Boards Association, which said it would threaten local control by giving the state board final decision-making power.
The bill would allow the state Attorney General’s Office, Department of Education, or “any person claiming to be aggrieved” to bring a civil action against a school if it is not in compliance. It would also designate any defiance of an order banning material to be a violation of the teacher code of conduct, which could lead to disciplinary action against educators.
The National Education Association of New Hampshire, the state’s largest teachers union, hailed the veto Tuesday, calling it a “classroom censorship effort.”
“Every student deserves to see themselves reflected in the pages of their books,” said NEA New Hampshire President Megan Tuttle in a statement. “NEA-New Hampshire applauds Governor Ayotte for standing up for the freedom to read in New Hampshire.”
Republicans, some of whom have sparred with Ayotte recently over the state budget, quickly voiced frustration. House Majority Leader Jason Osborne, an Auburn Republican, compared the vetoed bill to the recently passed legislation barring cellphones in K-12 schools.
“Now that kids can’t get porn on their phones while at school, at least they can still find it in the library,” Osborne wrote in a post on X.
Vetoes on biological sex separation bill, religious vaccine exemptions, others
In vetoing HB 148, Ayotte followed the path of her predecessor, Gov. Chris Sununu, who vetoed a nearly identical bill last year. 
In her veto message, Ayotte said the law ran the risk of doing more harm than good, and brought up concerns about discrimination of transgender people. 
“I believe there are important and legitimate privacy and safety concerns raised by biological males using places such as female locker rooms and being placed in female correctional facilities,” Ayotte wrote. “At the same time, I see that House Bill 148 is overly broad and impractical to enforce, potentially creating an exclusionary environment for some of our citizens.”
Her message to veto HB 358 highlighted the importance of childhood immunizations. “While parents must be the final decision makers on what immunizations their child receives, the State already has an established process by which parents can claim a religious exemption, and I see no reason to change it,” Ayotte wrote. 
She wrote that by requiring parents to opt in to surveys, rather than opt out, HB 446 would reduce participation in the “Youth Risk Behavior Survey,” an anonymous tool to measure the mental health, and sexual health, and alcohol and drug use of public school students. 
Ayotte said she had “heard tremendous concerns about this bill from those on the front lines of addressing our mental health crisis and helping those with substance use disorders, including state and local public health officials, youth mental health professionals, as well as the Governor’s Commission on Addiction, Treatment, and Prevention.”
And she said HB 667 should be developed because it is “not an appropriate role for the State to be mandating such requirements” onto school districts.
House Democrats cheered on the vetoes, though declined to give Ayotte direct credit. “We’re grateful that today New Hampshire chose to protect the rights and dignity of our transgender neighbors — and House Democrats will keep fighting until every Granite Stater can live freely, openly, and safely, no matter who they are,” said House Democratic Leader Alexis Simpson in a statement Tuesday evening.

(Photo courtesy of the Washington State Noxious Weed Control Board)It’s now illegal in Washington to buy or sell English ivy, the fast-growing, climbing vine that can weaken and kill trees and overtake native plants.
The Washington State Department of Agriculture, earlier this month, added 19 species, including English ivy and Atlantic or Boston ivy, to its noxious weed, seed, and plant quarantine list.
Under state law, all species on the list cannot be transported, bought, sold or distributed in Washington. Anyone who does have a plant on the list is required to destroy or dispose of it in a way that prevents its spread. 
 
 Problem plants
A list of the 19 species added to the noxious seed and plant quarantine list is available through the Washington State Department of Agriculture’s website. 
The full quarantine list and tools for identifying and disposing of prohibited plants can be accessed through the Washington Noxious Weed Control Board. 


The Department of Agriculture began the process of adding plants to the list in May after receiving multiple petitions from members of the public. 
“Initiating quarantines for these plants, forbidding entry or distribution of them gives a critical tool to control and prevent infestation,” the Department of Agriculture wrote in an explanatory statement that accompanied the update of the list. 
Public comment ran from May 7 to June 24, and the proposal was finalized on July 9. 
Feedback from the public and local stakeholders, including weed boards and other state-level organizations, overwhelmingly supported adding the 19 species to the quarantine list, according to the Department of Agriculture. 
Support for the inclusion of English ivy was especially strong, the agency said. 
In addition to shading out tree foliage, ivy can add weight to trees, increasing the risk of wind damage. It can also result in bark damage, making trees more susceptible to insects and disease. When the vine spreads on the ground, it can crowd out native plants.
English ivy has been classified as a Class C noxious weed in Washington since 2002, but that classification only allows individual counties to enforce control of the plant if they choose to, and doesn’t place any statewide limits on its distribution. 
“People really got involved and really communicated how much they value the trees and how destructive this particular plant was to those trees,” said Susan Hutton, executive director of the Whatcom Million Trees Project, a nonprofit that works to protect and plant trees in Whatcom County. 
Hutton’s predecessor at Whatcom Million Trees Project was among the petitioners who started asking the Department of Agriculture to add English ivy to the quarantine list a couple of years ago. 
Other groups that supported adding English ivy to the quarantine list were the Bainbridge Island Land Trust, Edmonds Stewards, the King County Noxious Weed Control Program, Birds Connect Seattle and the 10,000 Years Institute. 
“It’s a long legislative process to get on that list,” Hutton said. “It’s a huge win for us, and we’re thrilled.”
Whatcom Million Trees Project hosts English ivy removal work parties and provides free resources on its website for people looking to remove the invasive plant on their own.  
Public commenters voiced support for adding other plants to the quarantine list, including English holly, English laurel, and Himalayan blackberry. Those plants were not included in the update. 
The Department of Agriculture said that “while these suggestions were considered, some species could not be added due to regulatory, scientific, or procedural limitations, or simply because they are not currently available for sale in Washington state.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/english_ivy_main-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-15 19:11:43.336451

The food assistance provider cited unsustainable workforce levels in the wake of COVID-era programs ending.

Vermont Foodbank, the state’s largest food assistance provider, cut nearly 10% of its workforce two weeks ago.
The organization let seven employees go and discontinued two vacant positions. CEO John Sayles said Tuesday that the cuts were necessary for the company to avoid financial hardship down the line, as food banks become more stretched nationwide.
The COVID-19 pandemic more than doubled the food bank’s level of financial resourcing for a time, Sayles said, through increases in federal, state and philanthropic support. The organization grew from 60 to 88 employees, reaching its peak in 2023.
“We had to do what was in front of us,” Sayles said of the organization’s growth at the time.
Now, the picture is different — many COVID-era public programs have ended.
In addition, Vermont Foodbank said it was losing roughly 20% of its USDA food stock earlier this year due to federal budget cuts.
This restructuring also comes as cuts to the federal Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program threaten to leave thousands of enrolled Vermonters without coverage. About 65,000 people currently receive aid from SNAP across the state.
The timeline of these changes is uncertain, and Sayles said he was concerned that higher burdens on food shelves will collide with the need to downsize. “It really is hard to predict when and how things are going to roll out,” Sayles said.
The layoffs are intended to put the organization in a more sustainable position so “we can do the best we can to meet the need,” he said.
It’s unclear how much the food bank will immediately save through restructuring. Sayles estimated the personnel costs for the food bank will be roughly the same next year, even with fewer employees. 
Sayles said some pay raises were necessary to cover cost-of-labor adjustments, rising health care premiums and the need to retain talent.
The organization said it will try to protect against gaps in services, but the layoffs may put some parts of the operation under stress. 
“Everyone was doing work that was having an impact,” Sayles said.
He added that Vermont Foodbank had been in touch with a number of local partners to discuss how they might be able to pick up the slack. 
“Whether every single thing that the food bank did is going to continue to happen, I can’t say,” Sayles said.

She and other leaders of various immigrant advocacy groups said an ICE funding boost makes their ""know your rights"" mission increasingly important. (Photo by Patrick Lohmann / Source NM)The number of federal immigration enforcement arrests is expected to greatly increase in New Mexico and across the country thanks to a massive infusion of funding in the reconciliation bill President Donald Trump signed July 4.
Immigrant legal and advocacy groups here are doing their best to shield as many community members as possible, they told Source New Mexico in recent interviews. In particular, leaders of three prominent groups said they’re focusing on “know your rights” workshops as a way to not only increase public awareness of what to do during a raid by Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, but also to strengthen community ties in different immigrant communities. 
“They are a key way in which we are lessening isolation, increasing engagement and connection,” said Rachel Lazar, director of El Centro de Igualdad and Derechos, in an interview Tuesday with Source. “And they’re an entry point into organizing and continuing to give the community the opportunity to speak out.”
Resentment against Albuquerque ‘deliveristas’ may have sparked viral Walmart ICE arrest

The “Big, Beautiful Bill” contains $170 billion for Trump’s immigration crackdown, including $30 billion for ICE. That makes it the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country. 
The funding will go toward hiring 10,000 ICE officers within five years, along with upgrades of ICE facilities and the hiring of ICE immigration lawyers for enforcement and removal proceedings in court.
The bill also allocates $45 billion to build new immigrant detention centers. ICE’s 2024 immigrant detention budget was about $9 billion. 
The funding boost supercharges ICE as the agency aggressively targets immigrants in arrests and raids. Even before the bill passed, a coalition of local immigrant advocacy groups warned of a sharp increase in ICE operations, including workplace raids and doorknocking at homes of families and individuals. 
“So far in this administration that there’s been an uptick in immigration enforcement activities in communities across New Mexico at businesses and homes as well as out in the streets, and we’ve also seen a significant increase in the number of people detained day-to-day in detention facilities within New Mexico to hold people in immigration custody,” said Rebecca Sheff, senior staff attorney at the ACLU of New Mexico.
ICE arrested an Albuquerque man. He ended up in the hospital. Now no one knows where he is.

High-profile federal immigration law enforcement operations in New Mexico include reported arrests of about 50 people in early March arrested in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Roswell, along with a dairy farm in Lovington in early June. This month, ICE appeared to target gig-worker delivery drivers in a sweep at a Rio Rancho Walmart parking lot and also executed a violent arrest of a driver last week inside an Albuquerque Walmart. 
Lazar said El Centro is hosting workshops, roughly every week, tailored to counteract what it sees ICE doing on the ground here. That means offering guidance to, for example, business owners concerned about worker audits; nonprofits representing domestic violence victims; as well as partner organizations.
“We get dozens and dozens of calls every week from the community when there’s a detention that takes place,” she said. “And so we’re able to track patterns and tailor our [workshops] depending on the patterns that we’re seeing. What we’ve been seeing in the past week is an uptick of ICE knocks on the door, sweeps taking place in public places, inside and outside of Walmart.”
El Centro has a page on its website providing details of what people should do if ICE questions them. The same is true for the ACLU, and the New Mexico Immigrant Law Center. 
Sophia Genovese, a Georgetown Law School professor who worked at NMILC until recently, said the organization is going to be “much more aggressive” when it comes to education and outreach.
“People are not remembering their rights. They’re saying who they are, they’re saying where they’re from, and that is enabling ICE to detain them and hold them in detention and swiftly deport them,” she said. “That’s a big piece that I think continues to be overlooked.”
ICE ‘disappeared’ 48 New Mexico residents, attorneys say

The center and its partners are also focusing on building safety plans for families that contemplate whom they can call if someone is detained. 
“Having things mapped out so families have a plan is really critical,” Genovese said.
Fabiola Landeros, El Centro’s immigration organizer, said a woman at one of their workshops recently said she’s most afraid of being “kidnapped” and her family not knowing where she is. 
“She said: ‘I’m afraid, and my family is afraid, to not know if I get detained where I’m going to end up, if I’m going back to my family,’” Landeros said. “And that’s the scary part for our communities, not to know where our loved ones are.”
Landeros denounced the ICE expansion as, among many other flaws, a misuse of resources that will harm the economy, particularly in New Mexico. According to El Centro, immigrant workers in New Mexico represent about 13% of the state’s workforce in key industries, and 16% of small business owners. 
Landeros and Lazar also called on local elected officials to “hold the line” and “be bold” when it comes to fighting against Trump’s push for mass deportations. That means expanding local immigrant-friendly protections and passing statewide policies to ensure that “our hard earned tax-payer money isn’t used to fuel Trump’s deportation machine,” Landeros said.",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9797-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-15 19:11:43.336451

(File/Spenser Heaps for the Utah News Dispatch)COLUMBIA — Thousands more students in South Carolina can eat free breakfasts and lunches this school year due to increased participation in a federal program allowing universal cafeteria meals.
Three additional K-12 school districts — Berkeley County, Dorchester 2, and Spartanburg 5 — are participating in what’s called the Community Eligibility Provision program, according to the districts. That means they will no longer charge any child for a school meal, and no parent will need to fill out an eligibility form.
They join 59 school districts already enrolled in the 15-year-old program.
Under federal rules amended in 2023 to make qualifying easier, if at least 25% of students in a district qualify for no-cost meals because of their family’s income, then all students can eat for free: Applications are no longer required.
And in a state where more than 60% of K-12 students live in poverty, there’s only one school district that doesn’t qualify for the program: Fort Mill (York 4), just south of Charlotte.
The added participation follows the Legislature passing a law in May meant to encourage all eligible school districts in South Carolina to sign up, said Sen. Tom Davis, chief sponsor of the bipartisan legislation.
The law didn’t come with any money to help cover costs or penalty for not participating. Instead, it requires school boards that choose not to participate to pass a resolution explaining to the public why they’re not.
“The objective is to have 100% participation so every student” can eat, said Davis, R-Beaufort.
The law mimics a clause that’s been in the state budget since 2018. At the time, federal rules required at least 40% of students to qualify for no-cost meals to waive application requirements for everyone else. When the rules changed in 2023, 58 districts were participating.
Davis hopes putting the annual budget directive into permanent state law continues to increase participation as more people find out about it and force school boards to put in writing why they’re opting out.
Participation gets rid of the paperwork requirements that can result in very needy students going hungry or getting picked on. That’s because not all qualifying parents fill out the necessary forms for free- or reduced-price meals and, when they do, students can get singled out by their peers. If all students eat for free, no one’s bullied or shamed, advocates say.
However, the federal government doesn’t cover the cost for all students.

Previous legislation that would have required the state to cover the difference never got a vote.
While the budget clause had no enforcement teeth, it did result in more individual schools offering universal meals, Davis said.
Of South Carolina’s 71 school districts eligible for the program, nine aren’t offering universal meals district-wide in 2025-26, according to state Department of Education data. However, eight of those offer no-cost meals to all students in at least some schools.
Clover schools (York 2) is the one district where no school offers universal free meals. That’s because it’s too expensive, spokeswoman Stephanie Knott told the SC Daily Gazette. She didn’t say how much it would cost the district to participate but noted it barely qualifies, with 26% of students eligible, so the federal government would kick in little help.
Spartanburg 5, which has about 11,000 students, had been considering a district-wide expansion for years, said Penny Dininny, the district’s chief financial officer. The district offered free meals to all elementary and intermediary school students beginning in 2023 before deciding to expand for the coming school year.
The state law was part of the discussion, she said.
Lancaster County School Board members decided the cost of expanding district-wide was too expensive. The cost estimate in 2023, the last time they voted on a resolution, was an additional $2 million. So, they opted to offer it at the individual schools that qualified, according to district documents.
Richland 2 in suburban northeast Columbia offers free meals at 25 of its 33 schools, said spokeswoman Darci Rush. Expanding to the remaining schools “is not financially feasible,” Rush said, though she didn’t provide a cost estimate.
Spokespeople for the other six districts not participating did not respond to requests for comment or questions about why the districts didn’t participate.
Encouraging districts to offer free meals to as many students as possible benefits everyone, said Sue Berkowitz, director of Appleseed Legal Justice Center. Hungry children are more likely to perform poorly in school and misbehave, she said.
“We want to make sure kids don’t go hungry, and the easiest way to make sure kids don’t go hungry is to make sure they have access to nutritious meals at school,” Berkowitz said.
Future eligibility changes?
Rep. Jermaine Johnson, who has advocated for free lunch programs, praised the idea behind the law.
“I’m a big supporter of things like this,” said Johnson, a Columbia Democrat.
But he questioned whether eligibility could drop due to the federal law signed by President Donald Trump on July Fourth.
The “big, beautiful bill” as proposed by the House included a provision that would have raised the threshold for eligibility from 25% to 60% of students living in poverty — making it more difficult than ever in the program’s history to qualify for universal free meals. However, that proposal didn’t make it into law. The 25% threshold did not change.
But changes to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps, could reduce the number of qualified schools nationwide, according to the federal think tank Food Research and Action Center.
That’s because students can qualify for free meals based on eligibility for SNAP or Medicaid.
Under existing SNAP rules, people under 55 who can work — what the government calls “able-bodied adults” — are limited to three months of grocery benefits over a three-year period unless they can prove they work, volunteer or attend job training at least 80 hours each month, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
The new federal law expands that requirement to adults under 65 and no longer exempts parents of children older than 13.
It’s also unclear whether the state will need to start contributing to SNAP benefits, which are now fully covered by the federal government. The law requires states to pay a portion if their error rate tops 6%. South Carolina’s error rate for the last fiscal year was 9.25%, according to the latest data released June 30. Under the law, that would require South Carolina to pay 10% of the cost.
How much South Carolina may need to contribute will depend on if — and how well — the state improves in doling out benefits, based on a federal review of sampled beneficiaries. It would be up to the Legislature to decide whether to pay the full share, reduce eligibility or opt out.
The potential cost-sharing won’t be required until 2028, based on 2026 data.
So how the school meal program would be impacted remains unclear, Davis said.
Students could still qualify for free meals through Medicaid eligibility. And the law’s deepest cost-cutting provisions for the government health care program don’t apply to South Carolina.
But more families may rely on their children getting a free meal at school if they lose their SNAP benefits, Berkowitz said.
The law is “more important now than it ever was,” she said.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/summer-meals.jpg,,,2025-07-15 19:11:43.336451

The new funds are part of roughly $720 million in nationwide settlements with eight drug companies that allegedly contributed to the country’s opioid crisis. Idaho’s share is based on local data for opioids shipped and distributed and the prevalence of opioid use disorder.

These settlement funds will be distributed to Idaho’s opioid fund, local governments, and health districts to support our ongoing fight against this devastating crisis.”
Idaho’s opioid settlement money is funneled three ways: 40% goes to the state, 40% goes to counties and cities, and 20% goes to public health districts.

Seven of the eight companies part of the settlement can’t market opioids and must create a system to monitor and report suspicious orders. Another company part of the settlement, Indivior, can keep selling and marketing medications to treat opioid use disorder but can’t make or sell opioid products for the next decade.

Vermont Lt. Gov. John Rodgers and his wife, Brenda Rodgers, have sued the Town of Glover, bringing to court a longrunning debate over control of a section of the road where they live and run multiple businesses.
The lawsuit asks the court to rule that a roughly three-quarter mile stretch of Rodgers Road that runs through the couple’s property is not a town highway, but rather a private stretch of road connected to a town highway on both ends. Town officials consider this stretch of road to be part of a town highway and, therefore, town property. 
The road was named after the lieutenant governor’s ancestors and the section in dispute has been part of the family’s property since approximately 1838, according to the filing in Orleans County Superior Court.
“It has been my understanding, based on personal knowledge and experience living here for my entire life, that so-called ‘Rodgers Road,’ named for my family, exists as two segments of a town highway, separated in the middle by a private traveled way,” Rodgers wrote in an affidavit filed on June 11. “It has never been a through public road.”
The couple also filed a request for a preliminary injunction, which would prevent the town from performing upcoming planned work on the disputed section of Rodgers Road.Rodgers asserts he and his family have “kept and maintained” this disputed segment of the road since its existence. He cites his own work in the disputed area, including allegedly repairing a culvert and laying gravel. Rodgers stated that the road, even portions not included in the disputed segment, has been “extremely poorly maintained.”
The lawsuit includes a map of Rodgers Road prepared by Rebecca Gilson, a land surveyor licensed in Vermont. Gilson told the court in an affidavit that, in her professional opinion, no record existed that establishes the town’s ownership of the disputed section of Rodgers Road.

The town claims the road section is a Class 4 town highway. Vermont law does not require towns to maintain Class 4 highways for year-round travel, unlike Class 1, 2 and 3 highways.In his affidavit, Rodgers also alleged town officials told him they “have found no evidence that the disputed segment is a town highway,” and that a former selectboard member told him a portion of the road had been surrendered by the selectboard, though Rodgers admitted he could not find documentation of that.According to the lawsuit, town officials have said that there is proof that the disputed section is part of Town Highway 48. Also, they point to documents that Rodgers filed when giving a portion of his property to his son and daughter-in-law. The documents show the property is served by Town Highway 48, which officials took as an effective acknowledgement of the town’s ownership.Rodgers’ lawyers refuted this idea, writing that the reference to the document “is simply one of perpetuating wrong information supplied by the Town and is not reflective of their [The Rodgers’] intent.”Rodgers claimed that if the road is upgraded as planned, the influx in traffic could hurt the interests of the several businesses operating on his property, as well as endanger his family.Rodgers’ lawyers said the privacy of the road was important to those businesses. The farm grows cannabis as one of its crops, which can attract “unwanted attention,” the lawsuit states. Rodgers also stated in his affidavit that guests at the Rodgers Country Inn are attracted by the inn’s relative seclusion and that more traffic would cause guests to stop visiting.He added that the road runs within approximately 20 feet of his front door, and that making this section of the road public “would cause safety and security risks to my family.”This dispute has been ongoing for years, and garnered public attention after Rodgers made comments about the matter — originally reported by Laura Ullman of WCAX — on May 8 at a Glover selectboard meeting. In his comments, Rodgers threatened legal action against the town and said he would shut the road to through traffic.“The reason I would like to be able to negotiate something that the town could support is because if we don’t, then we’re both gonna spend a ton more money on lawyers,” Rodgers said at that meeting. “And if I win, I’m going to shut the road down completely. There’ll be no access. If you win, you’re going to spend a whole bunch of money on lawyers and then have to spend money fixing up the road and maintaining it forever. And so I just don’t see how the town wins.”

Following the meeting, a number of Glover residents signed a petition requesting that the road remain open to the public. Elizabeth Nelson, a Glover resident, wrote a letter to the Glover selectboard requesting that the road stay open. 
“If this road ceases to be a public through highway, it will make access for agricultural or residential use impossible to my property. It will also significantly affect my property value,” Nelson’s letter read. 
The board subsequently voted on May 22 to keep the entirety of Rodgers Road as a town highway under its current mixed Class 3 and 4 designations.
“We look forward to the court’s decision,” Rodgers told VTDigger on Tuesday, adding that he would keep the road open to permitted individuals if he and his wife won the case. 
Glover town officials could not be reached for comment regarding the lawsuit.

The scope of the far right’s project to abolish our freedoms to inquire and learn is breathtaking.
The post Right-wing group’s attacks underming freedom of inquiry in education appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE BOSTON GLOBE recently covered a complaint by Defending Education against Smith College’s admission policy on transgender students. Massachusetts policy makers should understand this as a maneuver in the far right’s campaign to undermine freedom of thought and gain control of America’s schools, from kindergarten through higher education. 
The Globe has covered attacks by Parents Defending Education (the parent of Defending Education) on public education in Newton, Milton, Lexington, and elsewhere. Massachusetts was one of the first states to come under attack by Parents Defending Education after its formation in 2021. A search on the group’s website for “Massachusetts” finds 185 entries.  
Parents Defending Education is not about parents, or education. It is an obedient servant of right-wing forces out to dumb down American education from K-12 through graduate school. The right’s lever to achieve its goal is to promote racial division and hatred against LGBTQ+ families.  
For example, in its first year of operation PDE filed a complaint with the US Department of Education and eventually a lawsuit alleging that the Wellesley schools were violating the civil rights of white students by hosting an online “healing space” for students of color after a mass shooting of Asian American women in Atlanta.  
PDE has filed similar lawsuits across the country involving education about America’s history of racial injustice, or the police murder of George Floyd.  
The Smith complaint is an example of how the right has seized on what it calls “transgender ideology.” Far right front groups frequently complain of “indoctrination” that offends “parents’ rights”—meaning, acknowledgement of the humanity of LGBTQ+ people. 
PDE’s attack on LGBTQ+ families is evident in the right’s book ban campaign. According to PEN America, in 2023-2024 there were over 10,000 books banned in America’s public schools. “Books by authors of color, by LGBTQ+ authors, by women. Books about racism, sexuality, gender, history.” PEN America separately reported that PDE had “curated lists of ‘radical’ books that they view as ‘indoctrination,’ and have actively sought to mobilize disaffected parents under the banner of ‘parents’ rights.’” 
The PDE complaint against Smith was signed by Sarah Parshall Perry, “Vice President and Legal Fellow.” Perry previously worked at the Heritage Foundation, for Trump’s first term Department of Education, and for the Family Research Council, which is identified by the Southern Poverty Law Center as an anti-LGBTQ+ hate group.  
PDE cheered  the recent Roberts court decision in Mahmoud v. Taylor, which allows conservative religious parents to effectively ban lessons with LGBTQ+ themes or characters from K-12.  As Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent, the “ruling threatens the very essence of public education” by giving religious parents “veto power over curricular choices long left to the democratic process and local administrators.” 
The Wellesley suit was brought by the Republican law firm of Consovoy, McCarthy, whose leading partner, the late William Consovoy, was a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and member of the Federalist Society. The firm has represented Donald Trump.  
In 2021 PDE, supposedly launched just that year by grassroots moms, paid Consovoy McCarthy $800,000.    
PDE’s president, Nicole Neily, told the Columbus Dispatch, “We just all work from home. … We’re all working moms.” That claim is ridiculous. Parents Defending Education had revenues of $5.1 million in 2023. Neily is a highly paid political operative in the Koch network.   
Parents Defending Education’s funders include a long list of right-wing funders and Donors Trust, known as the “dark-money ATM of the right.” Contributors to Donors Trust include Charles Koch, the Bradley Foundation, the DeVos family, and many other right-wing oligarchs.  
Lisa Graves and Alyssa Bowen of True North Research have uncovered PDE’s entanglements with Catholic conservative Leonard Leo, who engineered the appointments of the three Trump justices to the Roberts court. They also detail the connections of PDE to the radical right umbrella group Council for National Policy. Leo has served on the Council’s board of governors.  
The council’s education reform plan, spelled out in a 2017 memorandum to then-Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos and President Trump, is this: abandon public schools and replace them with “free-market private schools, church schools and home schools.”  
The scope of the far right’s project to abolish our freedoms to inquire and learn is breathtaking. Policy makers and real parents must challenge fronts like PDE that seek to turn K-12 through higher education into profit making ventures or Christian academies and impose thought control on higher education. 
Right now, the extremists are winning.

The rocks and white material (silica mud) surrounding the pool were probably ejected as the feature formed.  The pool is about 4 meters (13 feet) across.

On April 10, 2025, geologists from Yellowstone National Park were conducting routine maintenance of temperature logging stations at Norris Geyser Basin—their first such visit to the area since the previous fall.
When what to their wondering eyes did appear, but a blue water spring that was new since last year!
The new pool they found is located in the Porcelain Basin sub-basin of Norris Geyser Basin, immediately west of a patch of vegetation informally known as “Tree Island.” It is about 4 meters (13 feet) across, and the water in the pool was warm (about 43°C, or 109°F), light blue in color, and about 30 centimeters (1 foot) below the rim.
They spoke not a word and went straight to their work, as this was a job that they would not shirk. 
The geologists found that the pool was surrounded by numerous small rocks as large as 30 centimeters (about 1 foot) across, and the rocks themselves were covered by light-gray, fine-grained, sandy mud.  There also appeared to be two layers exposed in the sides of the pool, but the lower “layer” was just a coating left on the steep side of the pool when the water was at a higher level.
With all of this evidence of quite a commotion, they knew they had found a hydrothermal explosion!

That there might have been a hydrothermal explosion at Norris Geyser Basin is not surprising, given that the thermal basin has been the site of numerous such events.  Some, like a crater in The Gap subbasin, probably occurred before people were documenting the area and have an unknown age. Others, like the 1989 explosion of Porkchop Geyser, were well observed.  And thanks to a new monitoring station installed in September 2023, explosions can now be detected by geophysical data, including an explosion in the Porcelain Terrace area in April 15, 2024, that left a crater a few meters (several feet) across.
So when did this feature near Tree Island form?  Might it have been associated with an earthquake swarm?
One tool that can be used to investigate thermal changes at Yellowstone is high-resolution satellite imagery.  Although these data aren’t useful at night or during cloudy conditions, the daytime, cloud-free images provide exceptional views of the ground.  The satellite data indicate that there was no feature present on the west side of Tree Island prior to Dec. 19, 2024.  By Jan. 6, 2025, a small depression had formed in that area.  An image from Feb. 13, 2025, shows the water pool, indicating that the feature had fully developed by that time.
Another helpful tool for assessing hydrothermal activity in Norris Geyser Basin is the new monitoring station that was installed in September 2023 and that uses infrasound—low frequency acoustic energy—to detect hydrothermal activity.  Not only can infrasound arrays “hear” explosions, but they can also tell the direction from which the sound originated!  Interestingly, there were no strong and unambiguous explosion signals during the time over which satellite imagery indicate the feature formed.  There were, however, several low-level acoustic signals that came from the direction of the new feature.  The most obvious such signal was recorded on Dec. 25, 2024, but it was relatively weak, and there was no associated seismic signal—something that would be expected from a significant explosion.  Similar acoustic signals were recorded on Jan. 15 and Feb. 11, but again there were no seismic signals.
What does this combination of data all mean?  Could it be used to investigate the scene?
Clearly the new thermal feature did not form in a single major explosive event, like the one of April 15, 2025, in Norris Geyser Basin or the well-observed event of July 23, 2024, at Biscuit Basin near Old Faithful.  Rather, it appears that the feature formed via multiple small events that initially threw rocks and later threw silica mud a short distance, creating a small pit that became filled with silica-rich water.  The feature probably started to develop on Dec. 25, 2024, with further activity occurring in mid-late January and early February 2025.
The latest new thermal feature in Norris Geyser Basin—perhaps the most dynamic area in Yellowstone National Park—demonstrates the spectrum of ways in which hydrothermal features evolve.  Some form during brief and violent episodes of change.  Others may take shape far more gradually, like the new feature found near Tree Island that seems to have begun taking shape on Christmas 2024.
That’s the story from Norris, what a sight!  And it seems to have started on Christmas night.

“My dad who lived in New York, passed away two years ago, and ever since then, it certainly has been tugging at my heartstrings,” Ensler said in an interview Tuesday. “Just the thought of being closer to other family has certainly weighed on me.”
Ensler won the seat in 2022 against Republican Charlotte Meadows with 60% of votes, according to election results. The seat had been held by Republicans since 2002, according to election records. It was the first Democratic flip of a Republican-held seat in the Alabama Legislature since 2010.

Ensler, who plans to finish his current term in the House, said that he is most proud of working with other House Democrats to fight for voting rights and rights of minorities in the state.
“Even though the majority has still passed a lot of what I think are really harmful bills, it’s important that on our side of the aisle that we’ve stood up against some of those attacks on people’s fundamental and basic rights,” he said.
Rep. Tashina Morris, D-Montgomery, said in an interview Tuesday afternoon that she has loved working with Ensler and will miss the asset that he is to the Montgomery community and the state.
“I definitely understand his decision to not seek reelection, but he was an asset to our party,” she said.
Ensler said he was proud of fighting to make possession of Glock switches a state crime over the last three years. A version of the bill sponsored by Sen. Will Barfoot, R-Pike Road, became law in the spring as part of Gov. Kay Ivey’s public safety package. The bill, banning the possession of devices that can turn semi-automatic firearms into automatic ones, was the first firearm restriction legislation to pass the Alabama House of Representatives since 2010.
“I think it really demonstrates the ability to not give up on a really tough issue, and to work well across the aisle and build a really strong coalition of Democrats, Republicans, community groups and law enforcement,” he said.“I realize that getting any sort of gun legislation passed is a challenge, and recognize that it took a lot of work, but will certainly be worth it for people’s lives.”
He also is proud that funding for mental health in public schools made it into the fiscal year 2026 Education Trust Fund (ETF) budget, which takes effect on Oct. 1. The pilot program will get $2.5 million for the fiscal year.
“To have that support for our young people and to focus not just on the academics, which of course is so important, but to be able to support the whole child,” he said.
Ensler plans to bring back a bill that would make it a Class B misdemeanor to confine a dog for an unreasonable amount of time and establish guidelines for such. 
“It’s a little bit of a niche issue, but it’s really important,” he said. “There are just horrible stories of dogs who are abused and subjected to really cruel conditions.”
On the gun violence side, Ensler hopes to bring a bill for hospital-based intervention of gun shot victims and one that would require gun owners to carry their ID so that police can identify them, should they get pulled over.
Morris said she loved how Ensler has been present in his community throughout his tenure, which is what Ensler said he’d miss the most.
“He’s always very supportive and understanding the needs of the community when it comes to gun violence prevention,” she said.
Ensler said he enjoyed interactions with people in his district the most.
“I love bumping into constituents in the grocery store, getting coffee and visiting the schools in the district and throughout Montgomery, seeing our teachers and students firsthand, it is always really rewarding,” he said. “I’m going to miss that a lot.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Phillip-Ensler-March-5-2025-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 19:11:43.336451

State wildlife officials on Monday confirmed the presence of a non-native brown trout in the Flathead River basin, according to a press release from Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks.
An angler caught a brown trout in the Flathead River upstream of Pressentine Fishing Access Site in early June, and the department is encouraging anglers to report any additional brown trout caught in the drainage.
“Protecting our native trout populations is a priority,” FWP Regional Fisheries Manager Mike Hensler said in the press release. “Brown trout pose a threat to native species in the Flathead drainage, and we need the public’s help to manage this invasive species.”
Brown trout can harm native trout species, such as bull trout and westslope cutthroat trout, by outcompeting them for resources and preying on juvenile fish.
Montana FWP is deploying environmental DNA (eDNA) sampling technology to assess the extent of brown trout presence in the Flathead River and tributaries. This method will help identify areas where brown trout may be present, guiding future management actions.
FWP strongly urges anglers who catch a brown trout in the Flathead River or its tributaries to kill the fish immediately and report the catch to the FWP Region 1 office at 406-752-5501. Anglers are asked to provide the fish as well as the location and date of the catch to assist in monitoring efforts. The species can be identified by their golden brown to yellow-brown color, with dark spots often surrounded by lighter halos, and sometimes with red or orange spots.
In Montana it is illegal to relocate live fish from one waterbody to another, and doing so can result in fines or imprisonment, as well as forfeiture of fishing and hunting licenses.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/unnamed.png,,,2025-07-15 19:11:43.336451

U.S. District Judge Amanda Brailsford extended a temporary restraining order after hearing oral arguments in a lawsuit that challenges the Idaho Department of Health and Welfare’s plans to require citizenship status reviews for an HIV treatment program under the new law.
Federal judge temporarily protects HIV program from new Idaho immigration law

The judge granted preliminary class-action status in the lawsuit, which blocks the new law from denying HIV treatment to any immigrant patients who are or could benefit from the program in the future, ACLU of Idaho spokesperson Rebecca De León told the Idaho Capital Sun after the hearing. 
The lawsuit argues Idaho’s law would deny immigrants life-saving health care that prevents HIV transmission.
The order blocks the new Idaho state law’s enforcement in the program for about two weeks, until the judge decides on whether to grant a preliminary injunction, which could block the law’s enforcement while the lawsuit proceeds.
 Lawsuit targets new Idaho law denying public benefits to immigrants without ‘legal status’

Before Idaho’s new law, House Bill 135, took effect this month, the ACLU of Idaho and other legal groups sued state officials, alleging the law is unconstitutional by violating equal protection, that it conflicts with federal laws and that it even denies federal funds to people eligible under federal law. 
The legal groups are representing in the lawsuit five unnamed immigrants who rely on the program and an Idaho doctor who cares for dozens of patients in the program.

Within days of Idaho’s new law taking effect, the judge issued a temporary restraining order. The law cuts the few publicly funded services that unauthorized immigrants can receive in the state. 
Joanna Cuevas Ingram, an attorney for the National Immigration Law Center, called the case straightforward. She argued Idaho’s new law is preempted by federal law — and violates the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution — because federal law defines eligibility for federal public benefits. 
Idaho’s new law requires immigrants prove their “lawful presence” to receive public benefits. 
But that term has different meanings in different laws, ACLU of Idaho attorney Emily Croston told the court. 
Representing state government officials who were sued over the new law, David Myers, a deputy attorney general, argued the suing patients and doctor lacked a right to enforce federal law themselves. And he pointed to recent and historical legal guidance from the federal executive branch, arguing that extra eligibility requirements can be added to public benefits. 
Last week, the federal U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, announced it revoked a Clinton-era legal interpretation that HHS says “improperly extended certain federal public benefits to illegal aliens.”
Idaho’s law applies to a range of public benefits, beyond the HIV treatment program. ACLU is considering legal challenges for other programs affected by the law, Croston told the Sun.

(Ainsley Platt/Arkansas Advocate)Arkansans in 14 counties recovering from severe storms earlier this year may be eligible for food assistance under the USDA’s Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance (D-SNAP), the U.S. Department of Agriculture announced Tuesday.
An estimated 11,000 households are eligible for help with grocery expenses, the USDA said in a press release. People who might not be eligible for SNAP in normal circumstances can qualify if they meet certain criteria, including income limits and disaster-related expenses, the department release said.
Individuals can apply in person and by telephone through July 20. Eligible counties are Clark, Craighead, Crittenden, Greene, Hot Spring, Independence, Jackson, Lawrence, Pulaski, Randolph, Saline, Sharp, Stone and White.
“USDA is dedicated to helping Arkansas residents as they grapple with the aftermath of the severe storms and its impact,” said Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins. “We are working closely with state and our local partners to provide vital nutrition assistance to impacted individuals.”
 How to Apply for D-SNAP
To be eligible for D-SNAP, household members must either live or work in an identified disaster area, have been affected by the disaster, and meet certain D-SNAP eligibility criteria.
Eligible households will receive one month of benefits, equal to the maximum monthly amount for a SNAP household of their size, that they can use to purchase groceries at SNAP-authorized stores or from select retailers online to meet their temporary food needs as they settle back home following the disaster.
For more information about Arkansas SNAP, visit the Arkansas Department of Human Services. For more information about this and other available aid, callers from Arkansas can dial 2-1-1.
Current SNAP recipients in the designated areas are not eligible for D-SNAP, but they may request supplemental SNAP benefits to raise their allotment to the maximum amount for their household size for one month if they don’t already receive that amount.
The Trump administration approved two major disaster declarations for Arkansas following storms that produced damaging floods and winds in March and April.

The incident allegedly occurred on Saturday, July 12, 2025. | ScreenshotAn attempted firebombing of the Dickinson County Republican Party headquarters on Saturday has led to the arrest of a 19-year-old Iron Mountain man, who Michigan Republican Party Chair Jim Runestad on Tuesday called “a liberal Antifa scumbag” while reacting to the incident.
The Iron Mountain Police Department on Monday said that they arrested Zayn Edward Arcand on charges of arson and manufacturing and possessing a Molotov cocktail after receiving a report of a suspicious person in the area of 617 N. Stevenson Ave., which is the location of the Dickinson GOP headquarters. The caller observed the individual attempting to light a rag sticking out of a glass bottle, then throwing the unlit bottle at the building.
Video surveillance footage of the incident shows that the suspect, later determined to be Arcand, could not get the bottle to light and instead threw it at the building, causing it to shatter.
Police identified Arcand, visited his home and interviewed him. He told police that he made the bottles in his driveway and threw them at the building “to send a message against corruption,” police said in a news release issued Monday.
Runestad told Michigan Advance on Tuesday that it was his hope that law enforcement and the courts continue to go after violent offenders with political motives. He also noted that there were two shattered Molotov cocktail devices found at the scene.
“So often I see them treat them with kid gloves,” Runestad said. “This kind of violent extremist action has got to be made an example of.”
On social media, Runestad was less diplomatic with the alleged offender.
“On Saturday, a liberal Antifa scumbag threw a Molotov cocktail at the Dickinson County Republican County headquarters. Fortunately, the beta scumbag didn’t have enough arm strength to get his bomb through the window,” he wrote Tuesday on X. “The business next door caught the scumbag in the act, and he was arrested and is now facing charges. This is the kind of violence the [political] left is generating across the board with their absolute intolerance of any view that doesn’t adhere to their dogma.”

Runestad also posted surveillance footage of the incident to his X account.
The Dickinson County Republican Committee said the attempted attack’s folly was “due to the incompetence of the suspect and no significant damage was done.”
“We are grateful to God that no one was injured and continue to pray for all involved,” the party wrote in a news release issued Sunday.

State Ports Authority's Navy Base Intermodal Facility in North Charleston. Additional cranes awaiting construction can be seen in the background. (Photo by David Wren/SC Daily Gazette)Skyrocketing costs and construction delays at a rail yard serving the Port of Charleston have put a separate plan to move cargo containers by barges on a slow track, but the port’s top executive said Tuesday it will eventually become a reality.
“It is not dead. It has not been placed to the side,” Barbara Melvin, president and CEO of the State Ports Authority, told legislators during a subcommittee meeting of the state’s Joint Bond Review Committee.
“It is quite alive and well,” Melvin said, adding the largely taxpayer-funded rail yard – officially dubbed the Navy Base Intermodal Facility – must be completed first to make Charleston’s port competitive with other facilities that already offer near-dock rail.
“Our position is to offer the barge as a competitive choice to trucking,” Melvin said, echoing previous statements that moving cargo along the Wando and Cooper rivers will help ease truck traffic on local roads. “We believe the barge system is important to our future.”
That was good news to state Rep. Micah Caskey, a Lexington Republican and member of the fiscal oversight subcommittee.
“The political utility, the social utility and the lifestyle utility of the barge is perhaps — at least from the perspective of the people who live in the area — critical to justifying this entire endeavor,” he said, adding that “otherwise we’re just investing in a rail yard” to boost the port’s competitiveness by an unknown level.
The barge is in the permitting process, and the authority has spent $2.2 million in taxpayer funds on design work for wharf improvements needed to move containers by water from Wando Welch Terminal in Mount Pleasant to Leatherman Terminal in North Charleston.
Finding the rest of the money has been among the barge project’s biggest holdups.
The Legislature approved spending $550 million in public funds in 2022 for the rail and barge projects. The rail yard, however, is eating up almost all of that, and the authority has vowed it won’t dip into the public trough for those projects again.
The cost for the barge project has risen to $223 million from its original $150 million.
The State Ports Authority thought it was on track to receive money from at least one of two federal grants, but changes in priorities between the Biden and Trump administrations dashed those hopes. It still hopes to find money from federal sources and its own operations to cover the costs.
Meanwhile, the rail yard’s budget has swelled from an initial $349 million three years ago to $544.7 million now, largely because of inflation, tariffs on steel and unforeseen complications in building a southern access to the 118-acre facility.
Among the complications, Melvin said, are buried utilities that weren’t shown on Navy documents and additional demands from Norfolk-Southern railroad, which will move cargo containers to and from the rail yard along with competitor CSX Corp.
The rail yard’s opening has been moved from this summer to January 2026, although only the northern entrance will be available at that time.
A road linking the rail yard to the adjacent Leatherman Terminal won’t open until November 2026 – cargo will be moved on approved routes along city streets in the meantime. The southern entrance that winds down Charleston’s neck and then back up to the Navy Base site won’t open until March 2027.
Another wrinkle in the timeline is this year’s new contract between the International Longshoremen’s Association, a union that represents dockworkers, and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, a consortium of shipping lines that hires those dockworkers. That contract calls for the union’s technology committee to review and approve the operating system at new terminals, including the rail yard.
The union has just started that process and has 150 days to give its approval.
Sen. Sean Bennett, a Dorchester County Republican, said that review could extend well into December, and he asked Melvin if any delayed approval could hold up the January opening.
“It’s a push, but I’m known for pushing very hard,” Melvin said.
The ports authority is already training Longshoremen to operate the cranes at the rail yard – another mandate of the union’s new contract with shipping lines.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/NBIF-1-1024x524.jpg,,,2025-07-15 18:11:09.451666

(Getty Images creative)Wisconsin residents who receive federal disability benefits and also work will no longer be denied unemployment compensation if they get laid off under a federal court order issued this week.
The order effectively ends enforcement of a 12-year-old state law that disqualifies people from unemployment insurance coverage if they collect Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) payments.
The order, released late Monday, comes a year after U.S. District Judge William Conley found that the Wisconsin law barring unemployment insurance for SSDI recipients unlawfully discriminates against people with disabilities.
The Department of Workforce Development (DWD) did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment on the order. 
The law was passed in 2013 with only Republican support in the Legislature and signed by then-Gov. Scott Walker. It was based on the premise that most SSDI recipients didn’t work and that when they filed UI claims they were “double-dipping” and probably committing “fraud.”
That impression is false, according to Victor Forberger, whose legal practice is almost exclusively focused on unemployment insurance claims.
Many people with disabilities who qualify for SSDI are still able to do some kinds of work, and they often want and need to, Forberger said Tuesday.
“They need to do this work to support themselves,” Forberger said. The typical monthly SSDI benefit “is a bare minimum, and in some cases not even that.”
Forberger, working with two other law firms, filed a lawsuit in 2021 against Amy Pechacek, secretary-designee at the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development (DWD). The suit charged that banning SSDI recipients from filing for unemployment compensation when they lose work violates the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
In a ruling July 17, 2024, Conley sided with the plaintiffs. Despite that ruling, DWD continued to reject unemployment insurance claims made by people receiving SSDI payments.
Conley’s new order, filed late Monday, instructs Pechacek and DWD to stop enforcing the UI ban for people on SSDI.
The lawsuit was filed as a class action. In an order June 11, Conley certified two classes of people with claims under the litigation: Those who applied for unemployment benefits in Wisconsin after Sept. 7, 2015 and were denied because they received SSDI benefits; and those who had received UI benefits after that date, but then were ordered to pay them back because they also were on SSDI.
The plaintiffs and DWD still differ on how to handle remedies for the two classes of people.
DWD wants to reprocess their claims from the start, and argues in a court brief that some of them might still not qualify for unemployment insurance for other reasons. The plaintiffs want the order to include a provision for supplemental filings and hearings.
Conley’s order requires both sides to work out a remedy agreement by Aug. 18, and if they can’t, to each submit a proposed order and identify their differences.
The judge rejected two other proposed classes: UI claimants who were penalized after failing to report their SSDI income, and SSDI recipients who never filed for unemployment insurance after losing a job.
The penalties in the law were not part of the lawsuit, Conley wrote. Identifying who might have applied for UI and did not was “unknown and unknowable,” he added.
Forberger said Tuesday that there may be several thousand people who were on SSDI and were denied unemployment compensation as a result. Once the remedy details are resolved, he expects that notifying everyone who qualifies for payment will be a complicated and time-consuming task.
“We’ve got to do a lot of outreach and a lot of explanation,” Forberger said.

(Photo by Getty Images; logo courtesy State of Iowa)A former West Des Moines dentist who has been sued six times for medical malpractice has been sanctioned for the third time by the Iowa Dental Board.
The board’s decision, however, comes at least three years after the most recent allegations of misconduct — during which time, Dr. Jay Jensen’s Iowa dental license has expired and he has moved to Austin, Texas, according to board records.
In August 2024, the board alleged that at some unspecified point in the past, Jensen demonstrated a failure to meet the expected standard of care for a dentist and failed to maintain a level of competency in his work associated with a patient’s tooth restoration and dental-implant work.
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For months, the patient had reported experiencing significant pain and intermittent bleeding related to her implant, the board alleges. At the board’s request, a consultant reviewed Jensen’s work and allegedly concluded his work failed to meet the expected standard of care — although an oral surgeon to whom Jensen referred the patient disagreed, the board says.
Although board records don’t state when the questionable implant work was performed, the board opened its investigation of the matter in 2022.
By September 2024, one week after the board charged Jensen with failing to maintain a reasonable standard of competency in the practice of dentistry, Jensen’s Iowa license had expired and he was living in Texas.
Recently, the board opted to settle the case by imposing a $1,500 civil penalty and restricting Jensen’s nonexistent Iowa license to exclude the practice of implant dentistry and restorations. In its order imposing those restrictions, the board acknowledged Jensen no longer practices any form of dentistry in Iowa.
The Iowa Capital Dispatch was unable to reach Jensen for comment.
Six malpractice lawsuits filed by patients
The board’s disciplinary case appears to involve Jensen’s treatment of Madison County resident Stella Vicanovic, who is suing Jensen and West Des Moines’ Plaza Dental Group, where Jensen worked, for malpractice.
Vicanovic alleged that after her treatment in August 2022, she called Jensen to report an “odd sensation in her nose” and noted she was bleeding from her left nostril and felt as if the tissue there was torn. In October 2022, she allegedly reported she still had a feeling “like tissue had been torn or something was broken” near the site of one implant.
In February 2023, an oral surgeon at the University of Nebraska Medical Center allegedly determined one of the implants had “grossly exposed threads through the bone.” The problems allegedly continued through May 2023 when Vicanovic requested a referral to the Mayo Clinic. In his written referral to the clinic, Jensen allegedly noted that he wondered whether he had “perforated the floor of the nose” while attempting to install one of the implants.
At the Mayo Clinic, doctors allegedly found “metal within, or very close to, the bone just under the left nasal cavity,” the lawsuit claims.
In August 2024, Vicanovic sued, alleging that since the August 2022 procedure, she “has lived with teeth that have been unnecessarily reduced to stubs, when they should have simply been filed for veneers” and left with ill-fitting veneers and crowns” that have yellowed and emit a foul odor.
“They have begun to fall apart and dissolve,” the lawsuit alleges. “As the result of the overall effort of Dr. Jensen on her teeth, plaintiff is now left with an inability to smile, difficulty chewing food, and a smile which adversely impacts her appearance and challenges with speaking which impact her profession that requires public speaking.”
Jensen and Plaza Dental Group have denied any wrongdoing. A trial is scheduled for March 9, 2026.
Court records show that in 2010 and 2011, Jensen was sued by four different patients for alleged medical malpractice. Each of the four cases was later dismissed with no public disclosure of any settlement agreement.
In 2019, Jensen and a colleague at Plaza Dental Group, Dr. Steffany Mohan, were sued for malpractice by a patient who alleged that Mohan performed dental-implant work on her without disclosing that in 2016, the Iowa Dental Board alleged she failed to maintain a reasonably satisfactory standard of competency in the practice of dentistry and appeared to lack the clinical skills and knowledge for providing dental implants. The lawsuit was later settled out of court.
In 2024, a sixth malpractice lawsuit was filed against Jensen. In that case, a Polk County woman alleged Jensen performed a “total mouth extraction” of her teeth and placement of dental implants while failing to inform her that he had been barred from performing such work though a disciplinary order issued by the Iowa Dental Board.
The plaintiff in that case alleged she was left with “crooked implants and no teeth,” and that because none of her implants could be salvaged, she would need “full bone grafting of her jaw, from cadaver bone, and a sinus lift.” The case was dismissed by the plaintiff within hours of its filing, suggesting it may be refiled at some point.
Board sanctioned Jensen twice before
In addition to the six malpractice claims, Jensen was the subject of two disciplinary orders issued by the board before moving to Texas.
In October 2009, board charged Jensen with failure to maintain a satisfactory standard of competency in the practice of dentistry. The board alleged it had received a complaint concerning the quality of the care provided when Jensen performed “a full mouth reconstruction” for a patient.
The board said a consultant reviewed the care provided to the patient by Jensen and concluded he had failed to meet the expected standard of care, in part because he had restored the patient’s teeth without proper evaluation and reassessment, and there were problems with both dental impressions and crowns, all of which contributed to other issues such as facial and joint discomfort.
Jensen, the board alleged, “lacked the skill and judgment to properly treat this patient, which resulted in an overall failure of this case.”
After two years of continuances in the disciplinary case, Jensen and the board agreed to settle the matter in October 2011. Jensen agreed to pay a civil penalty of $5,000 and also agreed to restrict his practice by no longer performing major mouth reconstructions on patients.
In 2019, the board accused Jensen of violating the settlement agreement by again performing dental work that constituted a major reconstruction of a patient’s mouth.
Jensen was charged with failing to comply with a decision of the board. The board then agreed to resolve the matter by issuing Jensen a warning and by restating its 2011 prohibition on mouth reconstruction.

Appeals panel suggests the BLM can reevaluate its decision, indicating there’s a “serious possibility” the agency can substantiate its finding.
The post Court blocks Wyoming wild horse roundup, cites ‘ecological balance’ questions appeared first on WyoFile .","A federal court on Tuesday stopped the Bureau of Land Management from capturing thousands of wild horses, saying the agency failed to explain whether the roundup would maintain a “thriving natural ecological balance” on public land in southwest Wyoming.
The federal 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver returned the case to the U.S. District Court in Wyoming, where Judge Kelly Rankin had sided with the BLM and its several allies, including the state of Wyoming. American Wild Horse Campaign, Animal Welfare Institute, Western Watersheds Project and many others had sued on behalf of the wild horses and their advocates.
The BLM had already postponed the roundup, which was originally scheduled to begin on the cusp of the ruling.
The Wyoming court must now reconsider the case. The appeals court suggested the BLM could again address the conflict between horses, domestic stock and wildlife “in a manner that is designed to achieve and maintain a thriving natural ecological balance on the public lands.”
“[The BLM ] entirely failed to consider an important aspect of the problem.” Timothy Tymkovich
The BLM had maintained that it did not have to take that “balance” metric into account when it decided on the roundup.
“Since BLM admitted that it did not consider ecological balance, [its] plan failed to consider an important aspect of the [Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act],” Circuit Judge Timothy Tymkovich wrote for a three-judge appeals panel.
The roundup targeted about 3,600 free-roaming horses across as much as 1.1 million acres between South Pass and the Colorado border. Much of that land is a checkerboard pattern of private and public land ownership.
The Rock Springs Grazing Association, which sided with the BLM in the decades-long dispute, owns much of the private land in the region and leases public property for grazing. Nevertheless, “[p]rivate landowners are prohibited from fencing their land and preventing feral horses or other wildlife from passing through,” the appeals court said.
The appeals court panel found the BLM decision to be arbitrary and capricious. But instead of setting the plan aside, it suggested the BLM could likely mitigate the court’s concerns by offering a fuller explanation of its reasoning.
BLM argument “too clever”
The BLM puts captured horses and burros up for sale or adoption and imposes various safeguards and conditions to ensure they are treated humanely. Slaughter is not allowed.
Wild horse advocates called Tuesday’s ruling “a significant win and a meaningful check on BLM overreach.” The court found that “the BLM cannot sidestep the law to appease special interests and eliminate wild horses from their rightful habitat,” Suzanne Roy, executive director of American Wild Horse Conservation, said in a statement.

The three looked for “the biggest you can get,” Chatwin said. (Angus M. Thuermer Jr./WyoFile)
A representative of stock and wool growers did not comment Tuesday, saying he had not yet read the opinion.
The appeals court finding centered on the Administrative Procedures Act that requires the BLM to consider important aspects of a problem, among other things. The agency claimed it did not have to consider ecological balance when analyzing the roundup in a plan to manage resources across the region.
Instead, the roundup plan was a “precursor decision” to which the Wild Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act did not apply, the BLM asserted.
The appeals panel was unconvinced.
“This argument is too clever by half,” Tymkovich wrote. If the BLM’s position prevailed, that “would allow BLM to use the [resource management plan] process to skirt its Wild Horse Act obligations,” the decision states.
In reaching its conclusion, the court dismissed, for now, complaints that the BLM did not follow federal environmental and land-use laws, including that it gave short shrift to the potential of consolidating checkerboard holdings through a land exchange.
The court accepted the BLM explanation that “a land exchange would entail extensive surveys of millions of acres for mineral value, cultural resources, and potential hazardous materials, which would likely take years to complete and demand extensive agency resources.”

The coalition of 21 attorneys general sent a letter Tuesday to members of Congress, expressing concern over escalating incidents involving masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dressed in plainclothes and driving unmarked vehicles detaining people on streets and at homes, workplaces, and courthouses.



NM AG supports VISIBLE Act
In a statement provided to Source NM, New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez, one of the AGs who signed the letter to Congress supporting the VISIBLE Act, said, “It is essential that all law enforcement personnel in a free society conduct themselves in a manner that is both transparent and fully accountable. Unlike other nations, America has never been a place that tolerates police activity conducted in secret, and anyone charged with upholding our nation’s laws should do so openly and with the pride that only comes from serving the best traditions of our nation. Communities deserve to know who is enforcing the law and why. This legislation helps protect the integrity of our justice system and the public’s trust in it.”

“We have watched these detentions with alarm, as the imagery evokes comparisons to repressive tactics that have no place in a free country,” the letter says. “ICE officers’ now routine practice of carrying out arrests in public spaces through masked agents who do not identify themselves as law enforcement has the effect of terrorizing communities rather than protecting them.”

The legislation the coalition is supporting includes the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement, or VISIBLE, Act of 2025, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin.

In a video, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel addressed the dangers of immigration enforcement being conducted by agents without identification.
“We’ve already seen cases where bad actors are simulating this behavior to apprehend whomever they want and it’s only a matter of time before an officer is seriously hurt by a good guy attempting to stop what appears to be a kidnapping right before their own eyes,” Nessel said.

In a press release, Nessel also noted that the current ICE tactics contradict Michigan’s resisting and obstructing statute, in which a person is only guilty of those crimes if they knew, or had reason to know, that the individual issuing a command was a police officer. Similarly, officers executing home search warrants are typically required to announce their presence to prevent unnecessary escalation and ensure the safety of both citizens and law enforcement.
While the coalition acknowledged that there may be certain limited instances in which it might be appropriate for federal agents to conceal their identities, they warn in the letter that “widespread, unchecked use of masks and plainclothes enforcement undermines democratic principles, erodes public trust, and invites civil rights abuses.”
Joining Attorney General Nessel in signing the letter were the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Last Thursday, a mountain biker was out for an after-work ride on the Starry Goat Trail near Troy when he encountered a bear on the trail ahead of him. 
“Seeing a bear or any wildlife on the trail is really a treat,” the biker said in a video released by Montana Fish, Wildlife and Parks. “I didn’t expect it to turn into what it did, but it was very surreal.”
The cyclist said he was riding solo up the trail when he saw what he initially thought was a “weird looking root ball” on the trail ahead. He made some noise, just in case, and the “root ball” stood up, turned around, and began ambling down the trail toward him. 
Dismounting his bike, the cyclist pulled out his bear spray and disengaged the safety.
Based on the physical characteristics of the bear — a hump in the shoulders, the shape of its face and size of its feet — the cyclist said he thought it was a grizzly, and yelling to scare it off was unlikely to work. 
Instead, he waited until the bear approached within about 15 feet of him and discharged his bear spray. 
“The bear decided to, you know, reroute and leave,” the cyclist said. “He basically ran past me … up the hill and sat with his back towards me and started pawing at his face.”
Montana FWP released the bear safety PSA on Monday, just a few days after the department launched a new interactive grizzly bear conflict dashboard, a new tool designed to better inform communities about conflicts with the species. 
“Managing grizzly bear conflicts continues to be a priority for our staff and the workload is increasing every year,” FWP Director Christy Clark said in a press release. “This dashboard will help inform the public about just what kinds of conflicts Montanans are dealing with and where they’re happening.” 
While the biker near Troy said he believed his encounter was with a grizzly, FWP said the exact species is unconfirmed, and the encounter is not yet listed on the new dashboard, which FWP said is “updated regularly, but not until after the conclusion of a conflict.”  
However, there are 61 listed conflicts with 72 grizzly bears logged for 2025 so far. 
Most recently were two reported interactions with humans on July 11, one in the Whitefish Range and one near Livingston. 
FWP said in a press release that as grizzly bear populations have expanded in number and distribution in Montana, they increasingly come into close contact with human civilizations — encountering humans, agricultural landscapes, livestock and often garbage and waste left on private property or on public lands. 
“With this expansion comes an increased focus by Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks to help people and communities stay safe and avoid conflicts,” the release states. “Across Montana’s bear country, FWP staff are working hard to respond to conflicts, provide tools to landowners and communities to prevent conflicts, and to educate people on how to stay safe.”
The state agency also manages a grizzly mortality dashboard, and it’s working on launching a relocation dashboard later this year to track where problem bears with a history of conflict are moved to. Currently, the agency tracks bear, mountain lion and wolf relocation in a publicly accessible table. 
The table shows four male grizzlies have been captured and released in Flathead County, three as preventive measures and one following a human conflict incident. Another grizzly has been released in Missoula County this year following a livestock conflict. 
Grizzly bears remain federally protected in the Lower 48 under the Endangered Species Act, which puts them under a layered state, federal and tribal jurisdiction when conflicts arise. 
For example, while the state agency is responsible for dealing with conflict issues, relocating a grizzly bear requires approval from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.
Montana, Idaho and Wyoming, which all have populations of grizzly bears, petitioned the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to delist grizzly bears from the Endangered Species List and turn management over to the states. But in a Jan. 8 decision, FWS rejected the petitions and proposed a new comprehensive approach to grizzly management. 
Montana officials have long pushed for the state to take over management of the species, and U.S. Reps. Ryan Zinke and Troy Downing have cosponsored legislation in Congress that would remove the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem population of grizzly bears from the list. 
On Tuesday, the House Committee on Natural Resources debated that bill, the Grizzly Bear State Management Act of 2025, and recommended in a 20-19 vote to pass a favorable recommendation to the full House.",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/grizzly-bear-1024x792-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 18:11:09.451666

Blanchard Beach, Oakledge Cove, Blodgett Access Area, the Coast Guard ramp and Perkins Pier are some of the closed beaches, according to a Monday statement by the Department of Public Works. Signs have been posted at beaches and public access areas.
The contamination occurred when workers removed one of the plant’s clarifiers for maintenance, as the other tanks couldn’t handle the extra sludge. The Main Plant will have a fifth final clarifier that will make the plant more resilient, lowering the risk of similar issues in the future, the statement read.
Officials tested the water for E. coli contamination and decided not to re-open the beaches Tuesday afternoon. Results showed a concentration of 260 colonies per 100 milliliters of water, exceeding the EPA’s acceptable limit of 235 colonies per 100 milliliters.
The department stated the beaches will likely reopen around 6 p.m. Wednesday. 
People are advised to refrain from swimming and check water quality updates on the Swim Water page of the Parks, Recreation and Waterfront Department.

(Lindsey Toomer/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state Sen. Jessie Danielson will run to be Colorado’s next secretary of state in 2026, the Wheat Ridge Democrat announced Tuesday. 
Danielson is finishing her second term in the Colorado Senate after she previously served in the Colorado House of Representatives for two terms. She is looking to succeed Colorado Secretary of State Jena Griswold, a Democrat who is term-limited and is running for attorney general. 
“I’m running for Secretary of State to defend a democracy under threat and stand up for the patriotic election workers who make sure voting remains free and fair,” Danielson said in a statement. “I helped build the system that has made Colorado a national model for secure, fair and accessible elections — and now I’m running to protect it.”

Before her time in the Colorado Legislature, Danielson was the Colorado state director for America Votes, which advocates for fair elections and increasing voter engagement. U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, who was then governor, appointed Danielson to lead the statewide implementation of a 2013 bill that reformed Colorado’s election systems. She has led several bills that expanded voter access.
Danielson grew up in Colorado and graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder.
“I can say that I really understand the challenges that face Coloradans no matter what part of the state they live in,” Danielson told Newsline. “I believe it’s important for our chief elections officer to have a grasp on the law, and I don’t just understand Colorado’s election system. I helped build it.”
Danielson said she plans to travel around the state to connect with local leaders, including county clerks, “to assure them that this is a partnership from day one.” 
Jefferson County Clerk Amanda Gonzalez is also running in the Democratic primary for secretary of state. Other candidates who have filed paperwork with the secretary of state’s office to run include Republicans Cory Parella and Ross Taraborelli and unaffiliated candidate Melissa Richards. Democrats since 2018 have won all five of the Colorado government offices, including secretary of state, that are elected statewide. 
The secretary of state in Colorado is the state’s top elections official. The officeholder, elected every four years, also oversees corporation filings, campaign finance and other state administrative functions.

(Photo courtesy of Juan Sanchez)An often-overlooked part of recovery from a wildfire, which lasts for generations, is the series of emotions that come with witnessing the destruction, says Juan Sanchez, president of La Merced del Pueblo de Chililí, a land grant in the Manzano Mountains in central New Mexico.
After the Dog Head Fire in June 2016, when Sanchez drove up the mountain and saw the wreckage, the sadness was overwhelming, even tear-inducing, he said, “because your mountain is gone.”
Then comes the anger, which leads to asking why a fire happened, he said. Third and finally is the grief for that part of nature that is lost.
“That motherland of yours, your mountain, it’s something that your grandkids will never get to see,” he said. “What I have seen, what my ancestors have seen, how we use the mountain and how we lived in it before the fire.”

Other people representing land grant communities, local water systems and the state’s emergency management agency told lawmakers on Tuesday that more recent disasters have had similar lasting impacts.
At the interim legislative Land Grant Committee meeting in Las Vegas, they asked for reforms they say would help them prepare for and recover from disasters like wildfires and flooding.
Jeremy Klass, who leads the recovery and mitigation program at the state Department of Homeland Security and Emergency management, asked the committee to build capacity and increase funding for his agency, which leads disaster response in the state.
Klass said disasters are becoming more common — as are cascading events like flooding — federal programs are not structured to address those after-effects in a post-fire landscape.
The department is “sorely understaffed and underfunded,” Klass said. While he has 84 people on staff who are managing $2 billion in disaster funding, he said, he has hired an additional 144 private contractors, whose expertise will not stay in New Mexico once their contracts end.
“When these disasters go away, that capacity is gone,” he said, adding that the department needs that expertise on staff for future disasters. “I can’t do that without an increased budget and staffing,” he said.
Federal disaster aid is uncertain for states, even as Texas floods underscore need

 
The committee on Tuesday also heard from the New Mexico Acequia Association, whose members told lawmakers earlier this month about the challenges volunteer-run acequia organizations face trying to rebuild after wildfires and floods.
Eddie Quintana, president of the Los Vigiles Land Grant-Merced, asked the committee for legislation to make it easier for land grants to gain easement rights to travel through private property. Quintana said private buyers often buy properties surrounding them, resulting in a “landlock” that blocks their access.
The land grants use easements to care for their common lands, said New Mexico Acequia Association Executive Director Paula Garcia.
For example, Sanchez said in 2014, two years before the Dog Head Fire, his land grant had used access roads to thin out parts of the forest, which protected those areas from the blaze, while areas they had not thinned were devastated. He shared photos showing the difference.
“We know that thinning responsibility can actually decrease the likelihood of a catastrophic fire,” Gerald Romero, manager of the Tierra y Montes Soil and Water Conservation District, told the committee.

He starts by carefully getting the sample before exposing it to the test strip, letting it lay under the bright white lights of his exam room while he waits for the result. 
It’s inevitably positive. His patient has a pathogen that’s sweeping through a rural South Louisiana community. Having confirmed his diagnosis, Singh stuffs his patient into a black trash bag and into a storage bin. 
His patient is #310, a tomato plant from the village of Washington, not far from Lafayette, where tomato plants far outnumber people. The specimen he’s examining is already dead from a bacterial wilt pathogen, but his diagnosis can help farmers adapt and protect the rest of their crops.
  Raj Singh (LSU AgCenter Photo)
Known as “the Plant Doctor,” Singh runs the Plant Diagnostic Center at the LSU AgCenter. He examines an estimated 1,200 specimens each year — both samples sent to his lab and photos of sick plants texted to him by growers at all hours of the day. Singh scours the plant samples for signs of disease and advises farmers and other growers across Louisiana how to deal with the pathogens he discovers — and how to keep their plants healthy in the first place. 
It’s an important job in a poor, rural state that relies on agriculture and where farmers fight a hostile climate. Hurricanes and other severe weather events can stress plants, making them more susceptible to illness. Meanwhile, Louisiana’s warm and wet climate is particularly inviting to bacteria and viruses that can literally rot the roots of important crops and pass pathogens through plant systems, wiping out entire fields in the process. 
“Plants can’t talk, but they get sick,” Singh said. “It’s more like detective work.” 
It’s an apt descriptor for the Plant Diagnostic Center. Singh’s lab is a cross between the cluttered home of Sherlock Holmes and the high-tech exam room of Dr. Leonard “Bones” McCoy on board the USS Enterprise. Several refrigerators hum, carefully cooling his “patients” — samples of sick plants sent to him by farmers across the state. Diagnostic equipment sits atop pristine black work benches where Singh and his students — who he describes as doing their “residency” with him — work to get to the bottom of what’s harming the plants. 
It starts with an intake form, not unlike one used by a physician. It asks for the farmer’s name and the address for the field from where the sample was taken. 
It also includes checkboxes for different symptoms. Instead of coughing, sneezing and runny noses, the form asks whether the plant has spots, decay or wilting. 
Singh is able to identify most common pathogens within minutes using just a photo and information the grower provides. Rarer diseases require advanced diagnostics, such as molecular tests that can take days to get results. 
If Singh finds certain diseases, quarantine zones must be set up. One is currently in effect in New Orleans, where violators could face penalties for removing certain plant material from the area, where several citrus-killing diseases have been found. 
Singh also makes house calls. He typically goes on 60-80 site visits a year, and other researchers in his lab make even more. 
One researcher, Cian Butler, visits Avery Island every other week to inspect the iconic Tabasco peppers for signs of southern blight and other diseases that could disrupt the creation of their internationally famous hot sauce.

The differences between a healthy plant and a diseased one are very subtle to an untrained eye, but Singh and Butler are able to stalk quickly through the rows to find evidence of disease: wilted plants, discoloration and spotted leaves. 
“You have to be like a detective when you’re scouring these fields,” Singh said. 
While Singh can sniff out diseases and prescribe changes for better plant health, he’s unlike a medical doctor in one way — he can’t save his patients. They come to him dead, and even their plant relatives with the same diseases can’t be cured. But his advice can help prevent future outbreaks that could harm Louisiana’s economy.

,Source New Mexico,2025-07-15 21:36:57+00:00,Source New Mexico,More than half the states — including NM — have issued AI guidance for schools,"Madyson Fitzgerald, Stateline",,,,,https://sourcenm.com/briefs/more-than-half-the-states-have-issued-ai-guidance-for-schools/,Agencies in at least 28 states and the District of Columbia — including New Mexico — have issued guidance AI  in K-12 schools.,"New Mexico issued its K-12 AI guidelines in May, 2025.Agencies in at least 28 states and the District of Columbia have issued guidance on the use of artificial intelligence in K-12 schools.
More than half of the states have created school policies to define artificial intelligence, develop best practices for using AI systems and more, according to a report from AI for Education, an advocacy group that provides AI literacy training for educators.



New Mexico’s Public Education Deaprtment published its K-12 AI guidance in May. “Our vision is to bring AI into New Mexico classrooms and to do so in a way that puts students and educators at the center of this digital transformation,” PED Secretary Mariana D. Padilla writes in the guide’s introduction. “AI can enrich the learning experience, but it is human oversight, inquiry and reflection that ultimately drive meaningful education.”
The guide spotlights the Gadsen Independent School District, which it says “has adopted AI tools to support teachers with administrative tasks, lesson planning and communication, while also equipping students with valuable skills in utilizing AI ethically and productively.”
The guide says AI literacy for students K-5 should “focus on foundational concepts that include explanations, discussions, simulations and modeling that are online and ‘unplugged,'” and then build and grow in complexity for students in grades 6 through 8. AI literacy for high school students “should focus on deeper technical understanding, critical evaluation and real-world applications of AI, while encouraging ethical reasoning and innovation. These strategies may prepare students to think critically about AI’s role in society and explore its career pathways.”





Despite efforts by the Trump administration to loosen federal and state AI rules in hopes of boosting innovation, teachers and students need a lot of state-level guidance for navigating the fast-moving technology, said Amanda Bickerstaff, the CEO and co-founder of AI for Education.
“What most people think about when it comes to AI adoption in the schools is academic integrity,” she said. “One of the biggest concerns that we’ve seen — and one of the reasons why there’s been a push towards AI guidance, both at the district and state level — is to provide some safety guidelines around responsible use and to create opportunities for people to know what is appropriate.”
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

North Carolina, which last year became one of the first states to issue AI guidance for schools, set out to study and define generative artificial intelligence for potential uses in the classroom. The policy also includes resources for students and teachers interested in learning how to interact with AI models successfully.
In addition to classroom guidance, some states emphasize ethical considerations for certain AI models. Following Georgia’s initial framework in January, the state shared additional guidance in June outlining ethical principles educators should consider before adopting the technology.
This year, Maine, Missouri, Nevada and New Mexico also released guidelines for AI in schools.
In the absence of regulations at the federal level, states are filling a critical gap, said Maddy Dwyer, a policy analyst for the Equity in Civic Technology team at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit working to advance civil rights in the digital age.
While most state AI guidance for schools focuses on the potential benefits, risks and need for human oversight, Dwyer wrote in a recent blog post that many of the frameworks are missing out on critical AI topics, such as community engagement and deepfakes, or manipulated photos and videos.
“I think that states being able to fill the gap that is currently there is a critical piece to making sure that the use of AI is serving kids and their needs, and enhancing their educational experiences rather than detracting from them,” she said.

The state also sent more swift water rescue teams to Texas to help that state recover from deadly flooding. The personnel will join two other Oklahoma teams and human remains detection dogs that are already working in Texas’ Hill Country where 10 inches of rain fell July 4, causing the Guadalupe River to rise 26 feet. Officials said over 130 people died in the flash floods, and at least 100 remain missing, officials said.
The New Mexico support team consists of 10 people that will aid the State Emergency Operation Center with incident management. The team is expected to be deployed for seven days.
Two additional personnel from the Oklahoma Department of Public Safety were also sent to New Mexico Tuesday, said Keli Cain, a spokesperson for the state Department of Emergency Management. 
According to officials, monsoon rains caused the Rio Ruidoso to rise to more than 20 feet. The Ruidoso mountain village received about 3.5 inches of rain. Officials said all who were missing are now accounted for. Of the three people who have died during the flooding, two were children. About 200 Ruidoso homes were damaged by the flooding, officials said.
Support teams deployed Monday to aid in incident management. The team consists of personnel from the state Department of Emergency Management, the Office of Homeland Security, and from the Oklahoma City Fire and Tulsa Police departments. 
“Oklahomans know what it means to stand beside our fellow Americans in times of need,” Gov. Kevin Stitt said in a statement. “We will continue to serve our neighbors with strength and compassion, because that’s who we are. My prayers are with families who continue to recover from these tragic events, as well as the responders from Texas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and dozens of other states who are heeding the call to help.”
The two additional teams sent to Texas include personnel from the Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Broken Arrow, Verdigris and Mustang fire departments and the Grand River Dam Authority.
The teams are expected to be deployed for 14 days.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)More migrants were flown out of King County’s Boeing Field during the first six months of this year than all of last year as the Trump administration has moved to drastically ramp up deportations. 
That’s according to activists who hosted a press conference Tuesday outside the county-owned airport in south Seattle, where they also complained of increased obstacles from the county that hinder their efforts to observe and document the flights.
Through June 30, the advocates witnessed 42 immigration flights arrive in Washington this year, said Stan Shikuma, of the Japanese-American organization Tsuru for Solidarity. Three of those flights went to Yakima, not Boeing Field. Advocates couldn’t observe two of the Boeing Field flights, one because U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement made it harder to track its flights and another because it arrived close to midnight.
All of last year, 52 so-called “ICE Air” flights came into Washington. Those planes picked up at least 1,222 people transferred from the Northwest ICE Processing Center in Tacoma before likely deportation, according to the advocacy group La Resistencia, which has called for the detention center’s closure. That doesn’t include a few flights volunteers couldn’t observe, and others they may not know about entirely.
Through six months this year, more migrants have already flown from Boeing Field, a total of 1,342, said Shikuma. And 913 people were brought in to be detained at the detention center. The facility, run by the for-profit GEO Group has long faced scrutiny over alleged human rights violations that have received renewed attention as President Donald Trump’s deportation campaign has reportedly strained capacity there.
This month, another five flights have passed through Boeing Field, officially known as King County International Airport. That includes a flight Tuesday morning from which 15 detainees disembarked and 13 boarded, Shikuma said.
All the migrants are shackled at their wrists, waists and ankles, said Shikuma. They use stairs to get on or off the planes.
“What we’ve observed, as we’re watching these flights come in and out, are people in chains being taken off the buses from the Northwest Detention Center. They’re patted down, head to toe, mouths examined, sometimes the chains are tightened before they’re allowed to board the plane,” he said at Tuesday’s press conference. “Then, people coming off the plane, same procedure.”
Volunteer observers have also occasionally witnessed detainees held in a full-body restraint called a “Wrap” that is similar to a straitjacket, including in the past week.
The issue of Boeing Field being used for immigration flights has long been a concern.
Transparency concerns
Then-King County Executive Dow Constantine signed an executive order in 2023 committing to not using discretionary resources to support ICE operations. He also ordered the county to publish monthly data on the flights and how many migrants are on them. 
But La Resistencia says these logs sometimes provide incomplete lists of the flights and have never included the number of detainees. 
“Why can’t the county keep the promises it made in its executive order in 2023 which is a commitment to A, transparency about the flights which they are not delivering, and B, advocacy for more humane solutions, which also I’m unaware of their action,” said Angelina Godoy, who has researched ICE Air extensively as the director of the University of Washington’s Center for Human Rights. 
Since 2023, volunteers from La Resistencia and Tsuru for Solidarity have frequently sat around a conference table with live video feeds as immigration flights from the private charter airlines arrive at and depart the airport. 
The airlines include GlobalX, Eastern and, more recently, Avelo.
The volunteers count one by one as detainees walk down the plane’s steps, and look for anything out of the ordinary: people restrained in unique ways or who look particularly young, for example.
Another group sometimes watches from a fenceline near the planes, which are serviced by Signature Aviation in Seattle. 
Signature, with an office next door to the main terminal, is “profiting from this business,” Godoy said.
“They lease property from King County. So yes, King County does not have any contract with ICE. King County does not profit from deportation flights. King County makes money from Signature’s rent,” she continued.
After leaving the planes, people are loaded on buses and taken to the Northwest ICE Processing Center. The center has been a local flashpoint for frustrations over Trump’s increased immigration enforcement.
In one instance in early February, activists counted 110 detainees getting off a flight. The biggest flight La Resistencia said it had observed up to that point carried half as many people.
It took years to get to the point where activists could directly observe the flights.
In 2019, Constantine looked to stop immigration flights at the airport through an executive order. The first Trump administration sued the county over the order. A federal judge sided with the federal government in 2023, and an appeals court upheld the ruling, allowing the feds to again use Boeing Field for deportation flights.
The county then offered the observation room and Constantine signed the 2023 executive order.
King County Council member Teresa Mosqueda said in a statement read by advocates that she plans “to follow up on these calls for action.”
“We must now ensure the executive order on transparency be upheld at the last backstop for families and communities who are relying on flight visibility and tracking,” Mosqueda said.
Signature Aviation didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment Tuesday. A King County spokesperson couldn’t respond by the Standard’s deadline.

The city of Chelsea was named a 2025 ""All-America"" city by the National Civic League. The low-income, majority Hispanic city has faced a disproportionate share of environmental hazards and was recognized for three of its community-led environmental projects. 
The post ‘The ultimate underdog’: Chelsea named 2025 All-America city for sustainability projects a[...]","SUSTAINABILITY WAS THIS YEAR’S THEME for the All-America city awards, given annually by the National Civic League. But environmental awareness is nothing new for Chelsea, one of 10 US communities recognized by the organization on June 29 for their “transformative, community-driven efforts to strengthen environmental sustainability and their civic infrastructure.” 
“Chelsea has been doing this work before this work was catchy,” said City Manager Fidel Maltez, who traveled to Denver last month for the awards ceremony.  
Many communities have come to value sustainable practices like recycling or increasing green space. But Chelsea’s commitment to sustainability was born from years of environmental injustice. The densely populated city of 40,000 residents just north of Boston has long had to contend with a litany of environmental hazards – and the public health problems they bring.  
An endless stream of truck traffic and vehicle emissions blanket the community, which is home to the largest produce center in New England, with tens of thousands of deliveries per year. Its air is contaminated by toxic lead paint and thick dust from the busy Tobin Bridge, which looms overhead. With one of one the highest asthma rates in the state, Chelsea also stores a large portion of road salt and home heating fuel used in the region, as well as jet fuel used at nearby Logan International Airport.  
It’s all part of a long history in which poorer cities and communities of color have been saddled with a disproportionate share of environmental hazards.  
“Those industries are not in wealthy, white, and suburban communities. Those industries are placed here in Chelsea intentionally,” Maltez said. “They are placed in poor, in brown, in immigrant communities.”

Around 44 percent of Chelsea’s predominantly Latino population was born outside of the United States — the largest foreign-born population of any community in Massachusetts. Nearly 21 percent of the city’s residents were living below the poverty line in 2023, compared to about 10 percent across Massachusetts and 11 percent nationwide.  
“What is often highlighted in poor and immigrant communities is the bad stuff,” Maltez said. “We made it a point to go to Denver and share the really innovative stuff that we’re doing, particularly around climate change.”  
With only 3 percent of its land designated for parks and only a 2 percent tree canopy, Chelsea has been dubbed a heat island — lacking open green space and shaded areas. But thanks to the city’s Cool Block project, over 60 trees were planted on the city’s hottest block, the rooftop of their Boy’s & Girl’s Club was painted white to reflect sunlight, the heat-absorbent asphalt was repainted from black to grey, and a vacant lot was turned into a park.  
The “cool block” is the product of the city’s collaboration with Boston University’s School of Public Health and the Boston Society of Landscape Architects. Chelsea residents helped to point out the hotspot, collect data, and design the cooling strategies. 
Another project that helped bring home the All-America title was the city’s microgrid. Some residents relocated to Chelsea after Hurricane Maria, which left areas of Puerto Rico without power for months in 2017. Having witnessed the devastating impacts of grid failure, those residents called for climate resilience and reliable energy.  
After applying for grants, the city installed solar panels and large capacity batteries in critical infrastructure, including City Hall, a police station, and a public works garage. In its second phase, it will be extended to a Chelsea Housing Authority property as well as a hospital. 
In the event of climate disaster or grid failure, it will help deliver clean energy while keeping essential buildings and equipment powered. The savings generated by the clean energy sources and revenue generated by excess energy being sold back to the electric company will be used to reduce utility costs for low-income residents and further expand the microgrid.  
Maltez said the long-term goal is for Chelsea to govern and operate its own electric utility. 
A third project the community was recognized for was Chelsea’s network of over 80 air quality sensors. Deployed in partnership with Northeastern University in 2023, the sensors provide real-time pollution data and deliver air quality updates to residents and researchers via a multilingual digital dashboard. They are hung all over the community, including outside some residents’ homes. Maltez says the data will back them up in the fight for change.  
“We are really taking a data-first approach,” Maltez said. “In order to effectuate policy and in order to effectuate change, we wanted to track, basically, what is the real time air quality in our community.”

When he was appointed in 2023, Maltez, who immigrated to the US from Nicaragua when he was seven, became Chelsea’s first Latino city manager. The former civil engineer previously served as the city’s commissioner of public works.  
When asked if he’s been able to mobilize immigrant and Hispanic residents towards environmental sustainability, Maltez said this kind of work was in the city’s blood long before he assumed his role. “We continued the work that has been happening in Chelsea for over 30 years,” he said.  
Although industry often plagues their environment, it’s no secret that it is vital to the economy. Maltez says both can be true. “Chelsea is an environmental justice community. Chelsea is an industrial community. We are not trying to kick industry out,” he said.  
Chelsea has been named an All-America city twice before — once in 1998 and again in 2014. But Maltez said winning the award this year was special in light of the federal government targeting of immigrant communities – Chelsea was the focus of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement raid in March. 
Chelsea is easy to underestimate, said Maltez, who called the community “the ultimate underdog.” 
“We know that no one is going to come in and save Chelsea,” he said. “Chelsea has to take care of itself.”

María Elvira Salazar. (Via U.S. House of Representatives)South Florida Republican U.S. Rep. Maria Salazar introduced a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform package on Tuesday that would provide legal status for certain undocumented immigrants.
The announcement comes as the Trump administration leans further into its mass deportation efforts, with hundreds and sometimes thousands of undocumented migrants being detained on a daily basis.
“The Dignity Act of 2025,” co-sponsored with Texas Democrat Veronica Escobar — is a revised version of a bill that Salazar first introduced in 2023. It also would provide protections for Dreamers but would not allow for any federal benefits for migrants or a pathway to citizenship.
The measure would create a “Dignity Program” allowing undocumented immigrants who have been in the U.S. since 2021 to apply to live in the country for up to seven years with work authorization. They would have to pay $7,000 in restitution, stay in legal compliance, and check in with the Department of Homeland Security regularly. It would be renewable if individuals remain in good standing.
The measure would also create a $70 billion “American Workforce” fund that would be used for apprenticeships, retraining, and education for citizens, with one American worker trained for every “Dignity” participant. It would be funded through annual restitution fees of $1,000 and a 1% payroll levy on Dignity Program participants.
It would include border security provisions, with barriers, drones, and radar used to stop the flow of migrants. It would require nationwide E-Verify for all employers to check on the legal status of their employees. It also calls for DNA testing to verify family relationships at the border.
And it  would reform the asylum system. with most asylum cases to be decided within 60 days. It would include optional regional processing centers in Latin America. It also calls for penalties for fraudulent claims, with expedited removal for repeat violators.
The introduction of the measure comes as the number of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexican border illegally has been setting record monthly lows this summer. The Department of Homeland Security reported earlier this month that the number of encounters and apprehensions on the southern border was the lowest in history.
‘A commonsense solution’
“For 40 years, every president and Congress has looked the other way while millions have lived here illegally, many working in key industries that keep our economy running,” Salazar says in a written statement.
“It’s the Achilles’ heel no one wants to fix. The Dignity Act offers a commonsense solution: certain undocumented immigrants can earn legal status — not citizenship — by working, paying taxes, and contributing to our country. No handouts. No shortcuts. Just accountability and a path to stability for our economy and our future.”
“The vast majority of immigrants are hard-working, law-abiding residents; and, despite how maligned they have been by the administration, most Americans recognize that it is in our country’s best interest to find a solution,” Escobar added.
“We can enact legislation that incorporates both humanity and security, and the Dignity Act of 2025 offers a bipartisan, balanced approach that restores dignity to people who have tried to navigate a broken system for far too long.”
The bill’s attempt to merge border security with a path to remaining in the U.S. bears some resemblance to the immigration reform bill co-sponsored in the U.S. Senate by Florida’s Marco Rubio in 2013. While approved in the Senate that year, it died in the House.
A ‘duty to due process’
A former television news anchor, Salazar has served in Congress representing Florida’s 27th Congressional District since defeating Democrat Donna Shalala in 2020 and has been re-elected twice since then.
Last month, she said she was “heartbroken” about the uncertainty she said was “gripping” her South Florida district because of deportation actions by the Trump administration.
“Arrests in immigration courts, including people with I-220A and pending asylum cases, the termination of the CHNV (Cuban, Haitian, Nicaraguan, and Venezuelan) program, which has left thousands exposed to deportation, and other similar measures, all jeopardize our duty to due process that every democracy must guarantee,” Salazar said in a statement.
An additional 20 members of the House from both sides of the aisle are listed as co-sponsors of the bill, including South Florida GOP U.S. Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart.

At least 28 states have issued guidance on the use of AI in K-12 schools. (Photo by Matthew Hinton/The Associated Press)Agencies in at least 28 states and the District of Columbia have issued guidance on the use of artificial intelligence in K-12 schools.
More than half of the states have created school policies to define artificial intelligence, develop best practices for using AI systems and more, according to a report from AI for Education, an advocacy group that provides AI literacy training for educators.
Despite efforts by the Trump administration to loosen federal and state AI rules in hopes of boosting innovation, teachers and students need a lot of state-level guidance for navigating the fast-moving technology, said Amanda Bickerstaff, the CEO and co-founder of AI for Education.
“What most people think about when it comes to AI adoption in the schools is academic integrity,” she said. “One of the biggest concerns that we’ve seen — and one of the reasons why there’s been a push towards AI guidance, both at the district and state level — is to provide some safety guidelines around responsible use and to create opportunities for people to know what is appropriate.”
As the Trump administration loosens AI rules, states look to regulate the technology

North Carolina, which last year became one of the first states to issue AI guidance for schools, set out to study and define generative artificial intelligence for potential uses in the classroom. The policy also includes resources for students and teachers interested in learning how to interact with AI models successfully.
In addition to classroom guidance, some states emphasize ethical considerations for certain AI models. Following Georgia’s initial framework in January, the state shared additional guidance in June outlining ethical principles educators should consider before adopting the technology.
This year, Maine, Missouri, Nevada and New Mexico also released guidelines for AI in schools.
In the absence of regulations at the federal level, states are filling a critical gap, said Maddy Dwyer, a policy analyst for the Equity in Civic Technology team at the Center for Democracy & Technology, a nonprofit working to advance civil rights in the digital age.
While most state AI guidance for schools focuses on the potential benefits, risks and need for human oversight, Dwyer wrote in a recent blog post that many of the frameworks are missing out on critical AI topics, such as community engagement and deepfakes, or manipulated photos and videos.
“I think that states being able to fill the gap that is currently there is a critical piece to making sure that the use of AI is serving kids and their needs, and enhancing their educational experiences rather than detracting from them,” she said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-15 21:15:00+00:00,CT Mirror,"New work requirements could strip HUSKY health coverage from 170,000 in CT",Molly Ingram | WSHU,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/15/ct-husky-health-insurance-work-requirements/,Connecticut Treasurer Erick Russell said on Monday that CT will have to spend more to make up for federal budget cuts.,"On a call with fellow Democratic state treasurers, Connecticut Treasurer Erick Russell (D) said on Monday that his state will have to spend more to make up for federal budget cuts.
It’s not clear how much “more” means.
Connecticut passed its two-year budget in June, but lawmakers are expected back at the Capitol in September for a special session to determine what they plan to spend on Medicaid and food aid.
Russell laid out the expected cuts for his state:
“We expect nearly 170,000 people to potentially fall off the rolls of Medicaid based on these cuts that are being proposed,” Russell said. “We know that we have over 350,000 families who are reliant on food benefits every year that are being funded by the federal government.”
State officials have said they can cover some of the cost with money from the state’s rainy day fund, but they won’t be able to cover it all. Cuts to Medicaid aren’t expected until 2027.
Last week, Department of Social Services Commissioner Andrea Barton Reeves said they didn’t have the specifics on things like the new work requirements for Medicaid, which is called HUSKY health in Connecticut, until the Republican budget reconciliation bill passed. That, according to Barton Reeves, made it hard to plan.
“Without having had those work requirement rules, without having had the final version of the bill, all we could really do is take very educated guesses as to what might happen,” Barton Reeves said.
The Trump administration has defended the new Medicaid work requirements, saying the changes will preserve Medicaid for the “truly vulnerable.”
“The One Big Beautiful Bill protects and strengthens Medicaid for those who rely on it, pregnant women, children, seniors, people with disabilities, and low-income families, while eliminating waste, fraud, and abuse,” a fact sheet from the White House said.

(Sophie Nieto-Munoz | New Jersey Monitor) A state grand jury has declined to charge a Fort Lee police officer who killed a woman last year during what her family described as a mental health episode.
The grand jury’s decision comes nearly one full year after Officer Tony Pickens shot and killed Victoria Lee, 25, in her apartment. Lee’s killing renewed calls for local authorities to respond to some emergency calls with mental health specialists instead of police officers. 
“Why do we need armed officers at the doors of people who are trying to seek what’s essentially medical care, at all?” said Amber Reed, co-executive director of AAPI Montclair.
Reed said the grand jury’s decision not to charge Pickens illustrates a systematic lack of accountability for police violence that disproportionately harms communities of color.
“To see this family that did everything right and be treated at every step of this horrible tragedy in this way is not going to have a positive effect on our community’s willingness to seek help when they need it,” Reed said.
Authorities said Lee’s brother called 911 seeking help on July 28, 2024, and asked for “just an ambulance.” After being told police officers would arrive too, Lee tried to cancel the call, but the dispatcher told him police would have to respond because he reported that his sister was holding a knife, authorities said.
Police body camera footage from that day shows officers breaking down the door of Lee’s apartment, Lee appearing at the door holding a large water jug, officers yelling at her to drop the knife, and then one officer firing a single shot in her chest.
Last year, Lee’s family said she was not holding a knife when officers forced their way into the apartment.
Shortly after Lee’s killing, Attorney General Matthew Platkin issued a new directive that requires police to involve a supervisor when responding to barricaded individuals and mandates the presence of mental health professionals and less-lethal weaponry. The directive also encourages officers to wait instead of forcing their way in when responding to a barricaded person.

(Photo by Alexander Castro/Rhode Island Current)An unusually lengthy saga to craft Providence’s 2026 fiscal plan concluded Tuesday morning with Mayor Brett Smiley signing what he called “the most difficult budget” since his tenure began in 2023.
“We passed a balanced budget, and we did so without making cuts to city services while still making real sacrifices, to demonstrate both our own belt tightening, and to make sure that the burden of this year’s budget was not put exclusively on our taxpayers,” Smiley told reporters at a Tuesday morning press event in his City Hall office immediately before he added his signature to the budget.
City councilors, city employees and a couple of state legislators joined Smiley on the morning after the Providence City Council approved the budget for the second time via a 12-2 vote at a special meeting. (The Providence City Council needs to vote on matters twice before they can be sent to the mayor for final approval.) There were two no votes on the budget’s second pass from Councilors Shelley Peterson and Oscar Vargas. Councilor Ana Vargas was absent.
Smiley’s initial draft of the 2026 spending plan arrived on April 16. The ensuing 12 weeks involved much back-and-forth as councilors and the mayor enlisted the help of the Rhode Island General Assembly to permit the city to increase its levy, or overall tax revenue, above the 4% state-mandated annual cap. Two of the lawmakers who co-sponsored the legislation to OK the tweaked levy cap — Sen. Sam Zurier and Rep. Scott Slater, both Providence Democrats — attended the press conference and stood quietly in the lineup alongside Smiley and City Council President Rachel Miller.
The final $624 million budget accommodates a 5.85% increase in the city’s levy, below the 8% allowed by the recent state legislation or the 7.5% Smiley proposed initially. While the budget technically lowers property tax rates, higher property values mean most people will still receive bigger tax bills. 
The budget was revised in late June to even out tax bill increases among different types of homeowners. The finalized budget includes an average residential property tax increase of 6%, although non-owner-occupied homes with two to five units will still see the highest increase. 
The budget for fiscal year 2026 arrives two weeks after the fiscal year began on July 1.  
“Effective today, you can come in to the city tax collector to pay your bill if you’re anxious to do so,” Smiley said, and added that bills will also be available online this week. Paper bills via mail are being printed this week and should start to arrive in mailboxes sometime next week, Smiley added.
Because the budget arrived late, taxpayers will have a grace period until Aug. 20 to make their first quarterly payment. First-quarter tax bills are usually due in late July.
The 2026 budget also doubles the veteran’s exemption and increases the elderly exemption by 25%. Smiley said people who have had tax exemptions in the past don’t need to reapply. First-time applicants who are eligible can visit the tax assessor’s office at City Hall.

A ‘monumental’ budget process
“It bears repeating that this was an exceptionally tough year,” said City Council President Rachel Miller, noting spiking home values, rising rents and the cost of living for the city’s working class families as challenges to tackle in this year’s budget process. 
“On top of it all, we were faced with the added difficulty of making up for decades of underfunding our schools in this one year,” Miller added. “So the task before us as we entered this process was monumental.”
That underfunding exerted the most weight upon the budget: A November 2024 settlement with the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE) requires the city to pay $15 million, plus make additional investments in subsequent fiscal years, to cover deficits in the city’s school department, which has been under state control since 2019. 
For fiscal year 2026, the city needed to allot about $11 million toward the school settlement. To fill the sudden crater in the city budget, Smiley relied on the levy cap exemption and some deep slashes to individual municipal departments’ budgets. Smiley and city officials told reporters this was perhaps the first time so many departmental line items had been cut in one fell swoop. 
Smiley said many city departments will have to “make do with less, and you’re going to have offices being expected to produce the same amount of work with fewer employees, and so we know that that’s a sacrifice.” 
More than 20 positions — all of them vacant — were eliminated in this year’s budget, and Smiley said he does not expect the positions will return in the future. But the mayor emphasized the budget leaves core city services like trash, public safety and emergency services untouched. 
“I think it is the right and compassionate thing to do to look for opportunities to cut where, one, it won’t affect any services, and two, someone doesn’t lose their job,” Smiley said. “These city employees are our neighbors, our friends, your kids’ Little League coach. We are not going out looking to try to cut jobs and lay people off.”
The hiring freeze initiated at the start of the budget process has ended, Smiley said, as open positions are ones included in the budget.  
Meanwhile, Miller said one of the council’s priorities is finding new ways to think about revenue in Providence that don’t rely on property taxes. Both Miller and the mayor agreed that the city’s payment in lieu of taxes (PILOT) agreement with Brown University, which finalized in 2023, had been struck just in time.   
“I’m certain that if we were in negotiations with the private colleges today, given the changes in the federal landscape and the new financial pressures that they’re under, that their offer would be far less than what we were able to sign two years ago,” Smiley said, but noted he was not as “satisfied with where we are with the hospitals.”
Both Care New England and Brown University Health, the state’s largest health systems, have PILOT agreements with the city.
Miller said she agreed with Smiley and characterized the PILOT agreements with local colleges as “the strongest Providence has seen.” But the city, she added, is limited in its powers over institutions like Brown, whose state charter predates that of the city itself.
“I think that we have opportunities to work with the General Assembly to think about what any nonprofit institution expanding means for our tax rolls, because Providence cannot afford to keep removing property from the tax roll,” Miller said.
The full budget is available on the city’s website, as well as a tax bill estimator tool.

(Photo by Sean D. Elliot/Getty Images)Months after hosting games for the first two rounds of the NCAA’s March Madness tournament, basketball fever has apparently returned to Providence with this question: Is Gov. Dan McKee making a full court press to lure the WNBA’s Connecticut Sun to Rhode Island’s capital city?
WPRI-12 first reported that McKee met with “an investor who’s interested in potentially purchasing and relocating the Sun to Providence” at the Amica Mutual Pavilion (AMP) on July 11. The station states that the home of the Providence College Friars and the Providence Bruins was temporarily reconfigured as a basketball stadium for the showcase.
McKee’s office did not respond when asked about the validity of the rumor, but did share a copy of the governor’s schedule with Rhode Island Current confirming he was at the arena for a “meeting and tour” from 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.  
“That is the extent of the info we are going to share at this point,” Andrea Palagi, a spokesperson for McKee’s office, said in a phone call Tuesday.
Since 2003, the Sun has been owned by the Mohegan Tribe and plays at Mohegan Sun Arena on the tribe’s reservation, which seats 8,910 for WNBA games. The franchise was previously based in Florida, where it operated as the Orlando Miracle.
In May, Sportico reported the tribe hired investment bank Allen & Company to explore selling the team.
“Mohegan continues to evaluate all strategic opportunities in the best interest of the Connecticut Sun, [Mohegan Tribal Gaming Authority], and the WNBA,” tribal spokesperson Cody Chapman said in an emailed statement. 
Providence Mayor Brett Smiley said he was not involved with McKee’s meeting at the AMP and had no details.
“I only know what I read in the news,” he told reporters at the city’s budget signing Tuesday morning in his office at City Hall.
But even the prospect of getting a WNBA franchise in his city has Smiley believing Providence has the potential to have a passionate fanbase should the Sun relocate.
“Boston can have the Celtics, and we can have women’s basketball,” he said.
The Sun have qualified for the WNBA playoffs in 16 of their 21 seasons in Connecticut — winning two conference titles in 2004 and 2005. But the franchise still remains without a championship title. And the chances aren’t looking too hot this season, as the team sits at a 3-18 record as of Tuesday.
Any effort by the state to relocate the franchise to Providence would come at a time when the WNBA is seeing rapid growth and popularity in recent years, particularly following the emergence of star players like Caitlin Clark of the Indiana Fever in 2024. 
Last year, league officials inked an 11-year TV deal valued at $2.2 billion and has expanded to its 13 franchises in San Francisco — with plans to have 18 teams playing by 2030.
“The WNBA is in an explosive growth state right now,” University of Rhode Island marketing professor Dan Sheinin said in an interview. “I’m sure the governor sees this as a way to kind of reframe and rebrand the way people think about Providence and Rhode Island.”

Successfully courting the Sun’s relocation could help the state rebound from the Pawtucket Red Sox’s relocation to Worcester in 2021 — though the state did gain a professional soccer franchise last year. McKee, who often bills himself as the coach of “Team Rhode Island,” could see his re-election prospects improve, Sheinin said.
“There’s absolutely no question,” he said. “That’s something tangible and could be very meaningful to the population.”
Sheinin said a move to Rhode Island would give the franchise more centralized to New England —short of relocating to Boston — and could help the Sun build a broader regional identity beyond just Connecticut.
“It’s harder for people in New England — especially northern New England, Boston, etc. — to identify with the Sun,” he said. “Anything in Connecticut can’t escape New York.”
But the state’s size may be a hindrance to securing a professional sports team — especially at a time the WNBA is looking to get bigger, Sheinin argued. And if McKee is serious about courting the franchise, he said the state will need to put together a compelling economic package that may include upgrades to the AMP, which was opened in 1971.
“A lot of newer stadiums are being built as part of a center that has retail, restaurants and bars,” Sheinin said. 
The state would also need to prove that Providence can generate more revenue for the team than it would remaining in Connecticut. In June, Forbes ranked the Sun as the 11th most valuable WNBA franchise, valuing the team at $200 million, with $14 million in annual revenue.
Still, Sheinin said he believed Rhode Island’s small size would be outweighed by a passionate fanbase for the only pro team in town.

(Photo by Kyle Martin for the North Dakota Monitor)Two lawsuits involving pipeline company Summit Carbon Solutions and the North Dakota Public Service Commission have been combined.
The PSC, which approved a route permit for Iowa-based Summit last year, requested that the two lawsuits be merged.
One lawsuit is led by Burleigh County, the other by a group of landowners who oppose Summit’s proposed five-state carbon capture pipeline that would end at an underground storage area northwest of Bismarck.
CO2 storage law challenged in North Dakota Supreme Court hearing

In requesting the consolidation, attorney Zachary Pelham, representing the PSC, said “the two appeals are a mirror image.”
Attorneys for Burleigh County and Summit Carbon Solutions did not object to the consolidation.
Among the issues raised in the cases is a challenge to the PSC’s ruling that states zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines. Plaintiffs also argue the agency did not give enough consideration to the safety of residents along the pipeline route.
Another pending lawsuit involves a landowner challenge to the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s approval of permanent underground storage permits for Summit.
Summit plans to gather carbon dioxide emissions from ethanol plants in five states, including in Iowa and one in eastern North Dakota, and use pipelines to send the CO2 to a sequestration area in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties
In another case, the North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments in April in a challenge to a state law related to underground storage of CO2.
Summit describes its project as the world’s largest carbon capture and storage project. It would take advantage of federal tax credits that promote reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Supporters say it would help ethanol producers compete in the low-carbon fuel market and benefit farmers who supply the ethanol plants with corn.
In addition to North Dakota, Summit has obtained a state pipeline permit in Iowa and approval for a short section of the route in Minnesota. Summit has so far been unsuccessful in South Dakota. Nebraska has no state agency that handles CO2 pipeline projects.

July 15, 2025 | ScreenshotA former Republican lawmaker, gubernatorial candidate and election conspiracy theorist on Tuesday asked a Michigan House of Representatives committee to request federal investigations against three of Michigan’s top ranking Democrats, whom he has repeatedly accused of fraud and other crimes, incuding bribery.
Pat Colbeck, who served in the Michigan Senate from 2011 to 2019 and sought the Republican nomination for governor in 2018, presented a laundry list of election integrity concerns to the House Election Integrity Committee, chaired by state Rep. Rachelle Smit (R-Martin).
The three officials Colbeck asked to be investigated include Attorney General Dana Nessel, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and Supreme Court Justice Kyra Harris Bolden.
Nessel spokesperson Danny Wimmer, in a statement to Michigan Advance, dismissed Colbeck’s claims and accusations as “unhinged.”
“Anyone familiar with Patrick Colbeck’s post-legislative career of peddling unhinged and unproven election conspiracies can see how absurd it was to host him before a House committee,” Wimmer said. “His efforts have been rejected time and again by election experts and the courts. The fact that this committee entertained his testimony suggests they are fundamentally unserious about strengthening the laws that defend our elections. Attorney General Nessel stands by her comprehensive, significant work in investigating and prosecuting election law violations during her tenure in office.”
Benson spokesperson Angela Benander told the Advance that the committee was “doing a real disservice to Michigan voters by continuing to platform these widely discredited self-appointed ‘experts’ and allowing them to rehash their failed attempt to overturn the 2020 election.”
“It’s July 2025 – why are they spending taxpayer resources and valuable time on these debunked conspiracy theories? While everyone else is rightly focused on passing a budget and on legislation that solves problems for people in Michigan, the [House Election Integrity Committee] has hosted a parade of extremists to spout false information about our state’s secure elections,” Benander said. “It’s been seven months, and the committee has not introduced any legislation based on these presentations. The people of Michigan deserve to know why the Chair and the Speaker are letting a small group of social media-based election deniers drive the agenda.”
Benander went on to say that Michigan’s elections were secure, the results were accurate and that the Michigan Department of State was ready to work with the House on tangible improvements to election systems when the House was also ready.
A request for comment on Colbeck’s commentary sent to Bolden was not returned at the time of publication.
Colbeck, since the end of his political career, has been at the forefront of election conspiracy theories surrounding the outcome of the 2020 election, in which he claimed election officials at the former TCF Center – now Huntington Center – Detroit counting location connected election equipment to the internet. Colbeck claimed there was evidence of vote manipulation, assertions that were later reviewed in court and deemed unsubstantiated.
Republicans since that election have sought to relitigate the 2020 election results and have dedicated much time since retaking the Michigan House in 2024 to bolstering election security based on some of those past claims.
Colbeck’s invitation to the House Election Integrity Committee recounted many of his past claims, but also included new claims that the Michigan Bureau of Elections unlawfully destroyed election records, which Colbeck said was admitted to under oath in Hillsdale County court proceedings.
The former legislator was referring to the case against Stefanie Lambert Junttila, who is facing trial in Oakland County for alleged attempts to access and tamper with voting tabulators following the 2020 election. She also faces charges in Hillsdale, where it was alleged that she and former Adams Township Clerk Stephanie Scott permitted an unauthorized computer examiner to access voter data concerning the 2020 election, which included non-public information.
Junttila requested to adjourn the start of Monday’s trial in Oakland, citing preliminary examination testimony in the in Hillsdale case from Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater that she said contradicted statements he made to a grand jury, which indicted Junttila alongside former Republican candidate for attorney general Matt DePerno and former State Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) for allegedly tampering with election equipment.
After recounting his various concerns with Michigan’s election systems, Colbeck said he was recommending the Legislature pass new laws to fix the problems he highlighted, subpoena officials for additional information and request federal investigations against Nessel, Benson and Bolden.
Colbeck, based on the so-called evidence he brought with him to the committee meeting, asked the House to request a federal investigation into Nessel for fraud, willful neglect of duty, and intimidation of election officials in the wake of the 2020 election.
He accused Benson of deprivation of rights under the color of law, bribery, fraud, willful neglect of duty, intimidation of election officials, and the unlawful destruction of election records.
Colbeck similarly accused Bolden of bribery, which was connected to his claim against Benson. Colbeck has for months claimed that Benson gave Bolden’s campaign for Michigan Supreme Court, in a bid to retain her seat after being appointed by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, $82,500 while the high court was gearing up to hear the O’Halloran v. Benson election lawsuit.
Colbeck said the opinion in the case, which was favorable to Benson and her department, was written by Bolden. Colbeck claimed that was evidence of bribery.
“I can’t get into the mens rea [or the guilt of mind] on this. I don’t know if she had the intent of it being a bribe or not,” Colbeck said. “I don’t have access to those communications. All I have is FOIA access.”
Colbeck also said he requested the same kind of investigation into that political donation from the Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission, the Judicial Tenure Commission and now federal authorities, in addition to his request to the House on Tuesday.
On the subpoena front, which the House has shown a recent willingness to flex against Benson and Nessel, in particular, Colbeck suggested that the House seek to obtain the state’s Qualified Voter File transaction log and accountancy of data formatting errors.
“I think it’s important for us to know who, when, what and how these records were actually updated,” Colbeck said. “I do applaud the representatives who support the issuing of subpoenas for the election training materials, and if you recall the House asked nicely for these materials before being forced to issue a subpoena.”
He said that everyday citizens also hit brick walls when trying to request this information via the Freedom of Information Act, and that when requests are denied, “we often have to take the advice of Jocelyn Benson’s lawyer and sue for access to the information.”
“That approach is often expensive and time consuming,” Colbeck said. “Legislative subpoenas offer an alternative to this burdensome approach to election transparency.”
The data formatting error request would include seeking coding scripts, raw data and communications including Bureau of Elections chat records.
He said access to this information could validate or invalidate Benson’s narrative on the security of past elections.
In questions for Colbeck, state Rep. Mai Xiong (D-Warren) questioned his commitment to transparency and asked why he hadn’t sought to relitigate other elections, like his own election in 2011, the 2016 and the 2024 elections, in which Republicans surged and saw President Donald Trump ascend to the Oval Office.
In response, Colbeck said he would entertain a full audit of those elections, saying that was the heart of his request to the Legislature.
“For the record, I called for an audit of the 2016 election. I’ve called for an audit in the wake of the 2024 election,” Colbeck said. “What’s happening right now is that we have this big, little mystery box called the election system, and I think it needs to be opened up with a bright flashlight, and we should see it across the board and examine every single election.”
Xiong countered that there were real threats to American and Michigan democracy on the horizon. She worried about election issues in the 2026 election, which will occur with Republicans in charge of all levers of the federal government, and questioned why Colbeck was trying to relitigate the past.
“I did see your suggestions,” Xiong said. “You were a senator once. How come you didn’t introduce legislation back then to fix these issues? When did they start?”

Colbeck said he attempted to hold a committee hearing like the one the House was holding on Tuesday, parsing various anomalies in the 2016 election, saying that his staffers had discovered discrepancies in the pollbook numbers and the ballot containers.
He went on to say that his musings on election security defied party affiliations, because it was his own then-Senate majority leader, Arlan Meekof (R-Grand Haven), who he said prevented him from holding that hearing and having a frank discussion.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-15-at-4.40.11 PM-e1752612120987-1024x664.png,,,2025-07-15 17:11:37.293399

Shane Baker  questioned a UK course  in Gender and Women's Studies during a legislative committee meeting Tuesday. On Feb. 19, above, Baker presents a resolution to return a granite display of  the Ten Commandments monument to the Capitol.  (LRC Public Information)FRANKFORT — A Republican lawmaker questioned a University of Kentucky administrator Tuesday about a course offering in the university’s Gender and Women’s Studies program.
During a legislative committee meeting, Rep. Shane Baker of Somerset read from a course description that begins: “The 14th Amendment of the Constitution guarantees equal protection under the laws, but as Black Lives Matter and other protest movements indicate, this promise remains unfulfilled.” The course is listed for the 2025 fall semester. 
Baker asked if the course is being offered.
UK Provost and Co-Executive Vice President for Health Affairs Robert DiPaola replied that while he did not know the status of the Gender and Women’s Studies courses, university websites are still being updated. A search of all eight Kentucky public universities’ websites show most of the universities have courses that focus on Gender and Women’s Studies. 
  Dr. Robert S. DiPaola is UK’s provost and co-executive vice president for health affairs.
“Could you check on that and let us know if those are still offered?” Baker said. “And help us understand the value of those and why the taxpayer dollars should be expended on those things.”
The exchange came as the Budget Review Subcommittee on Education heard from higher education officials about their campuses’ compliance with a recently passed state law that bars diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives in higher education. 
Representatives of the state’s eight public universities and the Kentucky Community and Technical College System assured lawmakers that their institutions are in compliance with House Bill 4 passed by the Republican-controlled legislature earlier this year over Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear’s veto.
The institutions said they achieved compliance through actions such as eliminating diversity offices and adopting viewpoint neutrality policies. The universities are also in the midst of scrubbing and updating their websites to reflect the new viewpoint neutrality policies and comply with the state law, university officials said.
Murray State University’s new president also came under questioning.
Sen. Steve Rawlings, R-Burlington, a co-chair of the committee, asked Murray President Ron Patterson about a comment he made regarding DEI reported on radio station WKMS “DEI is going to look different,” Patterson had said, “but we continue to provide those support services. It’s just going to be in a different way.” Patterson’s academic experience includes roles in admissions, athletics, enrollment and DEI programs.”
  Murray State University President Ron Patterson
Rawlings said what Patters said is “a little concerning.” 
Patterson told the committee, “Our institution has been there for 103 years, providing strong support for student services to the western portion of the Commonwealth of Kentucky, and we’ll continue, again, to uphold and enhance their efforts — their student experience — to support their success, and that’s what that statement means.” 
Under HB 4, each of Kentucky’s higher education institutions was required to adopt a viewpoint neutrality policy by June 30 that “prohibits discrimination on the basis of an individual’s political or social viewpoint and promotes intellectual diversity within the institution.” The policies must be published online and in student and faculty handbooks. 
The committee also asked about any potential savings the universities may have after eliminating DEI programs and training. 
Western Kentucky University saved about $13,000 annually after no longer supporting DEI-related training or conferences. KCTCS is projecting a cost-savings of about $2.5 million annually, but much of that has been redirected elsewhere within its budget to support general student success. 
However, the University of Louisville hired additional legal counsel to review its compliance with HB 4. Executive Vice President of Legal, Governance, and External Relations Angela Curry said that during the implementation of the law, several members of the university’s legal office were spending about half of their work time “reviewing job descriptions, analyzing policies, editing gift agreements and answering many, many questions from community stakeholders.” Because of the need to ensure ongoing compliance with the state law, UofL decided to hire an additional attorney. 
University officials noted that the University of Kentucky, Northern Kentucky University and Kentucky State University had closed their diversity offices ahead of the passage of HB 4. Morehead State University President Jay Morgan said the institution did not have a diversity office. 
Patterson told lawmakers that some offices at Murray State have been renamed to “better reflect their responsibilities.” 
After the universities’ presentations, Michael Frazier, the executive director of the Kentucky Student Rights Coalition, addressed the committee. He was supportive of HB 4 during the legislative session and appeared alongside the bill’s sponsor, Rep. Jennifer Decker, R-Waddy, during a committee hearing. 
Frazier said that as a result of HB 4, Kentucky became the first state in the country to adopt viewpoint neutrality policies at each public university and college. However, there’s still “some work” to do when it comes to data and reporting, he added, particularly on how to assist low-income and underrepresented students and reexamining the state’s performance-based funding model for universities.

Rawlings said at the end of the meeting that the information that lawmakers have reviewed show that “DEI has not delivered measurable benefits for Kentucky students, especially disadvantaged students.” 
“What began with good intentions has evolved into a multi-billion dollar industry rife with tokenism, lacking clear metrics and producing no meaningful improvement in student outcomes,” Rawlings said, adding that higher education must “return to what works — accountability, transparent results and evidence-based policies.” 
The Kentucky law also has a reporting component. The universities are directed to provide students, faculty, and staff with a survey in the fall to “assess intellectual freedom and viewpoint diversity.” The Council on Postsecondary Education will publish and develop the survey this October. 
DEI has come under scrutiny from Republicans at the national level. President Donald Trump signed an executive order earlier this year directing the U.S. Department of Education to overhaul university and college accreditation programs to root out DEI standards. The Trump administration has sought more influence over universities nationally by threatening to take away federal funding.

(Getty Images)New Mexico environment and health departments on Tuesday announced it will offer free domestic well water testing to the first 100 participants in Mora from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on July 26.



				Testing will be available 10 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. in Mora, at the Contractor Connects hosted by New Mexico’s Disaster Case Management Team, located at the Mora Independent Schools 518 Ranger Dr, Mora, NM.			


“Private well owners in San Miguel and Mora Counties can come to this water fair and find out more about the quality of their household drinking water,” Ground Water Quality Bureau Chief Justin Ball said in a statement. “Free well water testing events give our communities peace of mind by helping families understand what’s in their water and how to keep it safe, at no cost to them.”
Participants will receive their results within two to three weeks, the department said. The testing “allows well owners to measure pH, specific conductance and levels of nitrates in their water, two measurements that are crucial to maintaining safe drinking water,” the news release said.
The state environment department noted it has tested 175 private drinking water wells at water fairs in the last year, with results available to view online.


How to collect water sample:

Let the water run for two to three minutes first
Fill a clean glass or plastic container without any odors with at least a quart or liter of the well water.
For homes with whole house filtration systems, collect the water at the well head prior to any filtration or softener systems, if possible
Fill the container with water as close to the time of testing as possible



More about the water fair program is available online.
The state also tests water from public water systems periodically, the results of which can be viewed on its Drinking Water Watch website.

(Photo by Brooklyn Draisey/Iowa Capital Dispatch)INDIANOLA — Members of the Simpson College community gathered Tuesday to welcome their new interim president to a near-empty — for now — campus, where she and other leaders honored late President Jay Byers and vowed to build off the legacy he left, even amid challenges facing higher education.
Susan Stuebner was selected for the interim president position after a national search and will officially start July 28, according to a news release announcing her selection. Acting board of trustees chair Terry Lillis said Tuesday the search yielded several candidates, five of whom were interviewed then narrowed down to three for campus visits.
Stuebner said when she visited the Indianola campus, she could see herself belonging in both the campus and community.
“I could sense immediately that the people of Simpson are what make it so special,” Stuebner said. “As I learned about the opportunities and challenges the college faces, I also felt that my experience could help us as we partner together to make Simpson even stronger.”

Colby-Sawyer College in New Hampshire, where Stuebner most recently worked and served for eight years as president, is facing many of the same challenges as Simpson College, she said. Those include a looming demographic cliff, fewer high school students choosing college after graduation and “the erosion of the public’s view of the value of higher education.”
In terms of financial struggles many private colleges face, Stuebner said “we can’t cut our way out of issues.” At Colby-Sawyer College, Stuebner said she worked to find new revenue streams, using the college’s most popular major in nursing to pursue outside partnerships in health care and nursing-related fields.
“That’s not necessarily the right fit for Simpson, but the same model would apply,” she said.
Stuebner will also focus on fundraising during her year as interim president. People don’t always understand the direct impact to students a donation to a small, private university can have, she said, and part of her job will be helping potential donors know this and learn more about the college.
One aspect of Simpson’s culture Stuebner said she appreciates is the institution’s and board’s commitment to inclusion and belonging, as well as to civil discourse. The realm of higher education is one of the rare areas where civil discourse can take place, she said, and while the college community needs to be “thoughtful” about how it proceeds amid increased scrutiny on colleges and universities, she’s happy these values are still present and important on campus.
In the months since Byers was found dead in the president’s campus residence in April, acting president Terry Handley said things have been difficult for the “very tight-knit campus community,” but he and his colleagues are excited to see Stuebner come to campus. Lillis said during his remarks the board was looking for someone who recognized the grief and healing process the campus community is undergoing following Byers’s death but could also look forward into Simpson’s future and have the financial and personal skills to ensure it is bright.
“It’s early, but I have a really good feeling about Sue and her ability to connect with people,” Handley said. “I just find her to be very, very genuine, very personal, but also a solid decision maker.”
Whether Stuebner stays on as the college’s official president, rather than interim, is a decision both she and the board, in consultation with the campus community, will make together, Handley said. According to the new release announcing Stuebner’s selection as interim president, the college’s board of trustees will conduct a review of Stuebner’s work later in the year and discuss a potential “mutual interest” in keeping her in the position permanently.
If the possibility of her staying on as president becomes a real option, Stuebner said she’d love the opportunity.
“I think Simpson is poised to emerge from this external challenging landscape with a compelling mission, successful education models and a very bright future,” Stuebner said. “It is, again, the people of this place that are going to help us grow and survive.”

,DC,2025-07-15 20:27:17+00:00,News From The States - Fair. Fearless. Free.,"Education Department in the middle of a growing tug-of-war between Trump, Democrats",Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/education-department-middle-growing-tug-war-between-trump-democrats,,"WASHINGTON  — The U.S. Department of Education has emerged as central in the struggle over control of the power of the purse in the nation’s capital.Democrats in Congress are pushing back hard on the Trump administration’s freeze of $6.8 billion in funds for after-school programs and more at public schools, some of which open their doors a few weeks from now. California alone lost access to $939 million and every state is seeing millions of dollars frozen.At the same time, the Supreme Court on Monday slammed the door on judicial orders that blocked the dismantling of the 45-year-old agency that Congress created and funds.The nation’s highest court cleared the way for the administration to proceed, for now, with mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the Department of Education that President Donald Trump ordered earlier this year.In her scathing dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that “the majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave.”Sotomayor, joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson, wrote that the president “must take care that the laws are faithfully executed, not set out to dismantle them.”“That basic rule undergirds our Constitution’s separation of powers,” she wrote. “Yet today, the majority rewards clear defiance of that core principle with emergency relief.”Just a day after the Supreme Court’s decision, House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters at a Tuesday press conference that while he hasn’t had a chance to digest the Supreme Court’s order, he also knows that “since its creation, the Department of Education has been wielded by the executive branch.”“I think that was the intent of Congress, as I understood it back then. We have a large say in that, but we’re going to coordinate that with the White House,” the Louisiana Republican said.“If we see that the separation of powers is being breached in some way, we’ll act, but I haven’t seen that yet,” he added.Letters from Democrats on frozen fundsTwo letters from Senate and House Democrats demanding the administration release the $6.8 billion in federal funds for various education initiatives also depict the Education Department as a key part of the tussle between the executive branch and Congress.Just a day ahead of the July 1 date when these funds are typically sent out as educators plan for the coming school year, the department informed states that it would be withholding funding for programs, including before- and after-school programs, migrant education, English-language learning and adult education and literacy, among other initiatives.Thirty-two senators and 150 House Democrats wrote to Education Secretary Linda McMahon and Office of Management and Budget Director Russ Vought last week asking to immediately unfreeze those dollars they say are being withheld “illegally.”“It is unacceptable that the administration is picking and choosing what parts of the appropriations law to follow, and you must immediately implement the entire law as Congress intended and as the oaths you swore require you to do,” the senators wrote in their letter.The respective top Democrats on the Senate Appropriations Committee and its subcommittee overseeing Education Department funding, Sens. Patty Murray of Washington state and Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, led the letter, alongside Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions.In the lower chamber, House Democrats wrote that “without these funds, schools are facing difficult and unnecessary decisions on programs for students and teachers.”“No more excuses — follow the law and release the funding meant for our schools, teachers, and families,” they added.Georgia’s Rep. Lucy McBath led the letter, along with the respective top Democrats on the House Committee on Education and Workforce, its subcommittee on early childhood, elementary and secondary education and its panel on higher education and workforce development: Reps. Bobby Scott of Virginia, Suzanne Bonamici of Oregon and Alma Adams of North Carolina.Democratic attorneys general, governors file suitMeanwhile, a coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Monday over those withheld funds, again arguing that Congress has the power to direct funding.The states suing include: Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.Pennsylvania Gov.

Alex Wong/Getty ImagesDevices that convert semi-automatic weapons into machine guns will no longer be redistributed in Minnesota following a lawsuit from Attorney General Keith Ellison against the Trump administration. 
Ellison sued the administration with 15 other attorneys general after the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF, agreed to stop enforcing a federal rule prohibiting forced reset triggers. These devices, which significantly increase a gun’s rate of fire, were previously classified as machine guns by the ATF; machine guns are illegal to possess under federal and state law. 
Lawsuits filed during the Biden administration brought the ban on forced reset triggers into dispute. While one federal judge in New York upheld the prohibition, a Texas judge ruled that the devices aren’t machine guns under federal law. That ruling was then under appeal. 
In May, the Trump administration announced a settlement, causing the ATF to stop enforcing the ban on forced reset triggers. The ATF planned to redistribute the devices — which the agency previously called machine guns — that it had already confiscated. 
Minnesota and the 15 other states involved in Ellison’s lawsuit will now be exempt from the results of that settlement. Rare Breed Triggers, the largest seller of forced reset triggers in the U.S., also agreed not to sell the devices in Minnesota and the other coalition states. 
Ellison’s lawsuit argued that the use of machine-gun conversion devices has been fueling gun violence. The ATF recovered 5,454 of these devices between 2017 and 2021, a 570% increase over the previous five-year period. Firearm homicides increased between 2018 and 2022 in Minnesota; most gun homicides did not involve the devices, and the state’s overall firearm mortality rate remains low compared to the rest of the country. 
“Machine guns have no place on Minnesota streets, nor do devices that turn semi-automatic firearms into machine guns,” Ellison said in a press release. “By making firearms far more deadly, these devices threaten the safety of both the public and members of law enforcement.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/GettyImages-624271200-1024x683-1.jpg,,,2025-07-15 17:11:37.293399

(Karen Kasmauski | Getty Images)Another miner has been added as a plaintiff in a class action suit pending against the federal Department of Health and Human Services over its prior shutdown of an agency crucial to helping coal miners protect themselves against dangerous black lung disease.
Matthew Ward, a coal miner since 1993 who lives in Mingo County, will represent the class in the suit alongside Harry Wiley, the case’s lead plaintiff, per court documents filed last week.
The case was initially filed on behalf of Wiley and coal miners in similar positions who, because of the federal government’s shutdown of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in April, had to go without services that were mandated to be offered through congressional action.
The shutdown saw every worker from the agency’s Respiratory Health Division and the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program let go. NIOSH, through those programs, is the only entity capable of certifying X-ray results showing that an active miner has been diagnosed with black lung disease. Those certified X-ray results are the only way for miners with black lung to request a Part 90 transfer, which allows them to move to a less dusty part of a mine without negative consequences like a cut in hours, pay or retribution from mine operators.
The Part 90 program was created through Congress in amendments to the Federal Coal Mine and Safety Act of 1969. The program effectively ended in April without an act of Congress through cuts by the newly created federal Department of Government Efficiency when all workers within the division were put on administrative leave pending permanent firings.
A hearing for the case was held in May. Attorneys for the coal miners argued that the nature in which the NIOSH cuts occurred and the consequences of those cuts — leaving coal miners without services the government is congressionally obligated to provide — was illegal. Attorneys for the federal government argued the cuts were “temporary,” but offered no evidence of when the services would return or in what form.
In response to those arguments, federal U.S. District Judge Irene Berger issued a preliminary injunction on May 13 ordering a “full restoration” of services at the Respiratory Health Division and the Coal Workers’ Health Surveillance Program.
Despite two months passing since that order, work at the surveillance program has still slowed and several of the functions it’s responsible for providing — including free black lung screenings for active miners through a mobile clinic — have yet to resume, per West Virginia Public Broadcasting.
Attorneys in last week’s filing argued that Ward’s experiences were similar to those of Wiley, the case’s lead plaintiff, and as such were appropriate to add in the suit as part of an amended complaint. Ward also testified at May’s hearing but was not included as a potential named plaintiff on the case until last week.
According to filings, Ward was diagnosed with complicated black lung disease in March 2025 at the New River Clinic, which is a partner clinic for the surveillance program. While he’s out of work temporarily due to injury, he would like to return to work in a less dusty part of the coal mine to not exacerbate his progressing black lung disease.
To do such, Ward filed in April 2025 to request a Part 90 transfer. According to the filings, he has yet to hear back from DHHS regarding his application or the status of his request.
Black lung disease has no cure. The best intervention, according to experts, is to limit exposure to dangerous silica dust that is becoming more common in mines as miners are forced to dig through more silica-rich sandstone to reach the little coal that remains in existing seams.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 20% of Central Appalachian coal miners are suffering from black lung — the highest rate detected in more than 25 years. 
One in 20 of the region’s coal miners are living with the most severe form of the condition.
The resurgence of black lung is hitting coal miners at younger ages than ever before due to the increased exposure to silica dust.

(Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)Lt. Gov. Micah Beckwith is among several Hoosier Republicans backing a new lawsuit against the state GOP, claiming that party leaders “undermined the rights of delegates” by making convention changes beyond their authority.
Joseph Bortka, a 2024 state convention delegate and current Marion County Republican precinct committeeman, filed the lawsuit Sunday in Marion County Superior Court. 
The suit names the Indiana Republican State Committee, 2022 convention chair Ed Simcox and 2024 convention chair Randy Head as defendants.
The complaint alleges that party leadership repeatedly silenced delegates, bypassed convention procedures, and rewrote internal rules without consent.
“It’s fundamentally a shareholder suit, the delegates as shareholders and the State Committee as the board of directors,” Bortka said in a statement. “When the State Committee frustrates attempts to rally the Party’s collective will by silencing properly brought motions on the convention floor without a vote, or rewrites the rules to undermine the will of its Republican membership, they violate their fiduciary duties to the Party.”
The complaint alleges that party leadership “refused to allow” certain issues to be voted on by the convention — including motions and resolutions proposed by delegates — while “misleading the convention” about their rights and changing rules in ways that “undermine the rights of delegates and the rights of the convention as a body.”
Story continues below.
COMPLAINT
 
The lawsuit specifically pointed to proposals that sought to amend party convection rules and platform positions.
Among other claims, Bortka argues that recent rule changes made by the state committee — including the removal of Robert’s Rules of Order as the convention’s procedural guide and blocking motions from being heard — are part of a broader attempt to consolidate power at the expense of delegates’ rights. 
The lawsuit seeks a declaratory judgment affirming that the biennial convention is the party’s highest authority and an injunction preventing future convention chairs from “arbitrarily blocking delegate action.”
“No other recourse exists to resolve this dispute save for the court,” Bortka wrote in the complaint, citing failed attempts to seek remedy through internal party channels.
The filing does not seek monetary damages but instead requests the court enforce internal party rules and grant access to party records for transparency.
Various Republican activists and organizations — including Beckwith, the Hoosier Freedom Caucus, Indiana Republican Assembly, and Tea Party groups — are supportive of the lawsuit, according to a press release issued by Bortka. 
Neither the lieutenant governor’s office nor the Indiana Republican Party responded to the Indiana Capital Chronicle’s request for comment.

He confessed to sexually assaulting and murdering 5-year-old Zoey Felix in October 2023 in a homeless encampment in Topeka. (Pool photo by Evert Nelson/Topeka Capital-Journal)TOPEKA — A perpetually homeless man abused by his parents and shuffled as a youth among more than 17 foster homes and two psychiatric hospitals received a life sentence in prison Tuesday without possibility of parole for half a century in the rape and murder of a Topeka preschool girl entrusted to his care.
Shawnee County District Judge Jessica Heinen ordered Mickel Cherry, who admitted to smothering 5-year-old Zoey Felix in 2023, to serve consecutive life sentences requiring incarceration for a minimum of 50 years before being evaluated for possible release. Defense counsel recommended their developmentally disabled client serve the pair of life sentences concurrently so parole could be an option after 25 years. The prosecution argued the extreme depravity of the crimes necessitated at least 50 years behind bars.
Cherry pleaded guilty to both offenses in exchange for the district attorney not pursuing the death penalty.
“The evidence shows you violently, forcibly and inhumanely raped Zoey,” Heinen told Cherry at close of a heart-wrenching two-day hearing. “You then murdered Zoey.”
Heinen, who had the authority to order concurrent or consecutive life sentences, said her decision reflected Cherry’s attempt to conceal his involvement by blaming an imaginary Mexican man and lying repeatedly to Topeka law enforcement officers. In a police station interrogation on the day of Zoey’s death, Cherry confessed and has remained at the Shawnee County Jail for the past 650 days.
The judge asked Cherry if he wanted to make a statement to the court, and his response — “No, Ma’am” — frustrated some family members looking for a glimmer of remorse. They had spent two days studying his mostly blank expression and tendency to bury his chin in his chest. He spoke periodically to his attorneys, but made few hand gestures given that his wrists were handcuffed to a chain linked to ankle shackles.
Zeke Felix, Zoey’s father, said in an interview that he wasn’t content with the decision of District Attorney Mike Kagay to set aside the capital punishment option. He understood there were potential legal complications with seeking the death penalty because of Cherry’s diminished mental capacity, but thought an attempt should have been made to achieve what he viewed as full justice for his daughter.
“I’m not content, but satisfied,” said Zeke Felix, who sat during the proceeding in the front row behind prosecutors. “The death penalty was off the table.”

‘Conscious decision’
Kagay, who handled the sentencing phase with two colleagues from the district attorney’s office, said there was no easy way to talk about what the defendant did to the victim. He said in most criminal cases there were thin slices of humanity or fractured pieces of a puzzle to provide context or explain the horror.
“Not here,” he said. “Not in this case.”
Kagay said it was outrageous that Cherry, while divulging how he squeezed the life from Zoey, informed a Topeka police detective that sometimes a “good person” such as himself committed senseless crimes.
“Mickel Cherry made the conscious decision to kill Zoey. Why? In a failed attempt to avoid responsibility,” Kagay said. “The most egregious crimes demand the heaviest penalties. Each of these crimes call out today for justice.”
The district attorney responded to defense witness testimony and court filings dedicated to outlining how Cherry emerged from a Texas childhood marked by abuse and mental instability to land in an isolated Kansas tent encampment where Zoey’s life ended. Kagay conceded state foster care systems allowed children to fall through the cracks, but he rejected that required mercy beyond setting aside the death penalty for Cherry.
“The law has already shown him clemency,” Kagay said. “There is no question who is to blame here. No failure of any system caused him to rape and murder Zoey Felix.”

‘Heart of the issue’
Defense attorney Peter Conley, who is the state’s deputy capital defender, presented evidence Cherry endured persistent abuse while a minor. There were Texas reports showing his mother put a lit cigarette to his head, leaving a permanent scar. Domestic violence was a routine occurrence in his parents’ home, reports showed. He was beaten with sticks, fists and even a hammer by adults in his life.
The large but incomplete file on Cherry’s upbringing indicated he lived in places where adults required disobedient children to stand in a cold shower all night or remain crouched in stress positions for hours. Elsewhere, he was forced to spend long periods of time in a yard with a dangerous dog. He was adopted at age 14, but was subsequently left on his own at 18 without the skills to live independently.
“The system failed him utterly and completely,” said Beth Robinson, a professor at Colorado Christian University who was the first Texas counselor Cherry encountered when taken from his parents at age 5. “He needed a whole different type of therapy and intervention.”
She testified for the defense that one-third of children who spent extended time in foster care ended up homeless and about half eventually found their way into criminal entanglements.
Conley said it was important the sentencing judge in Kansas respond to the odious offenses committed by Cherry by imposing a life sentence. It was equally significant for the court to factor into the equation the role of a dysfunctional Texas foster care system as well as the Kansas Department for Children and Families’ failure to sufficiently respond to reports Zoey was being neglected, he said.
That history argued for a sentence that provided Cherry a thin but reasonable hope of walking out of a prison in something closer to 25 years instead of 50 years, Conley said.
“The heart of this issue is DCF had information about unsafe environments for Zoey Felix and didn’t do enough about it,” Conley said. “Actions have consequences. Mickel needs to be punished. Inaction also has consequences.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/20250714_MickelCherryTrial-POOLPHOTOS.EN-9-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 17:11:37.293399

The most spectacular example of this failure comes in the case of Immigration and Customs Enforcement subpoenas. In April, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment received a subpoena from ICE seeking personal information on sponsors of immigrant children. Release of the information could improperly expose dozens of residents to immigration enforcement.
Colorado law is supposed to protect against this sort of disclosure. It prohibits state personnel from sharing personal identifying information with federal immigration officers except in response to a court-issued subpoena or to assist with a federal criminal investigation.
Instead of upholding the law, Polis claimed to have interpreted the subpoena as being issued as part of a criminal investigation, contrary to all indications, and ordered the information to be released.
A state employee, Scott Moss, sued Polis over this decision, and it was revealed in court that the Labor and Employment Department had already received and complied with another ICE subpoena in March. Then The Denver Post last week reported that the department has actually received at least four federal subpoenas related to immigration enforcement. A department spokesperson told the Post that it is following a court ruling against certain employees being made to comply with the Moss case subpoena. But as for the other three subpoenas, the state has disclosed nothing about its response, since the subpoenas purportedly involve “active investigations.”
Given this lack of transparency and Polis’ eagerness to accommodate ICE, it’s fair to assume the state has provided ICE everything it’s asked for that’s not specifically barred in the Moss case.
Such intergovernmental cooperation might be forgiven in normal times with normal agencies. But the times are not normal — the Trump administration behaves like it’s unconstrained by laws or basic human decency. And ICE is not a normal agency — its unaccountable agents defy court orders, dispense with due process, kidnap people off the streets and disappear them to brutal foreign facilities.
Someday ICE will be abolished, and Americans will remember it with singular shame. Why Polis would make himself complicit with it — even in apparent violation of state law — is a question that should haunt the rest of his career.
But he is not the only authority in Colorado helping ICE terrorize communities.
The Loveland Police Department has allowed the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to access data from the city’s Flock Safety surveillance cameras, and as 9News learned last month, an ATF agent has searched the city’s Flock data on behalf of ICE. This breach at the very least exposes a loophole in the state law against information-sharing with ICE, if not an outright violation.
Last month a Mesa County sheriff’s deputy pulled over Caroline Dias Goncalves, a Utah college student, in Grand Junction. The deputy let her go with a warning, but not before asking her, “Where are you from? You’ve got a little bit of an accent,” extracting from her that she was born in Brazil. A short time later, federal immigration enforcement agents detained her.
Sheriff’s office representatives later revealed that the deputy had shared information about Goncalves on a Signal group chat with federal authorities. Even the sheriff’s office acknowledged that such use of information was “contradictory to Colorado law.” 
Episodes like these are transforming American society into a nightmare of paranoia and cruelty. States authorities who accommodate federal adversaries only compound the fear. Residents deserve leaders who, in accordance with ethical behavior, not to mention the law, resist those who mean Coloradans harm.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Starting in August, low-income South Dakota families participating in a welfare program will receive less money to spend on necessities such as gas, groceries, utilities and rent. The benefit cut is the beginning of more reductions planned in the next few years.
Lawmakers on the legislative Rules Review Committee voted 4-2 on Tuesday in Pierre to support the state Department of Social Services’ plan to reduce Temporary Assistance for Needy Families benefits by 10%. Recipients will lose anywhere from $32 to $136 a month in benefits, depending on the size of their family. The average household will lose $51 a month.
The state will save about $1.5 million annually. It distributed $15.3 million in TANF benefits last fiscal year.
TANF is a federal-state program most commonly used to provide financial assistance to low-income families with children, on the condition that the caregiver searches or trains for a job.

The two Democrats on the committee, Rep. Erik Muckey and Sen. Liz Larson, both from Sioux Falls, voted against the cut. They argued lawmakers were not aware of the reduction in benefits when they prepared the state’s budget earlier this year, and that the plan was a misrepresentation of legislative intent. Muckey said he and other legislators on the budget committee believed the $5.3 million state funding cut would be replaced with unspent TANF funds from previous years.
Instead, the department’s plan is to use $3.8 million of unused TANF funds and the 10% benefit reduction to cover the $5.3 million cut. The department plans to gradually reduce benefits each year, said Department Secretary Matt Althoff, cushioned by some unused TANF funds, until South Dakota reduces benefits to the minimum state contribution needed to receive federal funding.

“A 35% reduction all at once is a lot more devastating to a household than is the 10% on a strategic glide or slope,” Althoff said.
Gradual cuts until the state reaches a 35% reduction add up to the average household eventually losing $180 a month in benefits.
Republicans on the committee approved the plan, saying it was up to the department how to deal with the reduction in state funds.
“In appropriations we do not get down into the most minutia of running programs,” said Sen. Taffy Howard, R-Rapid City. “We have to leave those to the agencies to a certain degree.”
Althoff told lawmakers many TANF recipients receive other support: 99% of TANF households are enrolled in Medicaid, 97% receive Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program funds, 57% live in subsidized housing and 15% are enrolled in the state Child Care Assistance program.
“TANF is not something that makes households whole,” Althoff said.

Two people spoke against the benefit cut Tuesday, including Cathy Brechtelsbauer. She opposed the proposal during its earlier public hearing in Sioux Falls as well.
“We don’t go through the whole budget process during the state Legislature and then show up in the summer and say, ‘Oh, we want to cut money and take it from children,’” Brechtelsbauer said.
The rule change also removes TANF eligibility for families who take in child relatives in situations when they’re removed from their homes by the state’s child welfare system. 
That change incentivizes caregivers to become licensed kinship caregivers with the state, Althoff said during an earlier public hearing. The current foster and kinship subsidy rate for a child in South Dakota is between $22.85 and $27.43 a day, depending on their age. That would be roughly $685.50 to $822.90 a month, per child.
Lawmakers approved rule changes in May to create the licensed kinship foster care pathway, as required by the federal government. Caregivers must meet training requirements to become a licensed kinship home, similar though less intensive than traditional foster care requirements. There are no such requirements for TANF money.
According to the department, 184 cases per month managed by the department involving families eligible for TANF could be eligible for kinship subsidies.
Families who take in kin and apply for TANF use the “side door” to receive state and federal support, Althoff said. Eliminating TANF eligibility encourages families to “come in through the front door.”",https://southdakotasearchlight.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/591A0329e-1024x682.jpg,,,2025-07-15 17:11:37.293399

(Courtesy of Jiang's campaign)A Superior Court judge partially approved a recount request filed by an Assembly candidate in Bergen County who finished less than half a point behind his closest opponent — but the candidate’s request to inspect ballots was denied.
Demarest Councilman David Jiang, a Democrat, finished third in a four-person race last month for two spots on the November ballot in the 39th Legislative District, which covers a northern swath of Bergen County. Jiang ran 137 votes behind former Woodcliff Lake Councilwoman Donna Abene.
Judge Kelly Conlon approved Jiang’s request to rerun machine vote totals but denied his push to hand review all ballots, meaning the review will be limited to in-person machine votes cast on or before election day. Mail ballots will be processed through tallying machines but won’t be subject to a hand review, said Michael Ash, who represented Jiang.
“This recount … is vital in order to ensure that the voters of District 39 have properly had their votes counted, their votes exercised, and making sure that the right individual was elected to the seat,” Ash said during arguments Tuesday.
He told the New Jersey Monitor the decision marked “a good day for the checks on Democratic processes.”
Jiang ran on a two-person slate of Assembly hopefuls backed by Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop, who lost his bid for the Democratic nod for governor on June 10. Jiang’s running mate, former Dumont Mayor Andrew LaBruno, finished in first place. Their two opponents ran with the backing of Bergen County’s Democratic Party.
Statewide, nine Assembly candidates backed by Fulop won their contests last month and will be on the ballot in November, though only one — LaBruno — won in a district where two party-backed candidates were also seeking the nod.
The 39th District is currently represented by two Republicans in the Assembly.
Jiang in court filings argued differences between the sum of district vote totals and contest-wide tallies justified a recount, even if that difference was far too small to change the race’s outcome. Contest totals showed Jiang with one more vote than the sum of district totals (Abene’s count was eight votes higher).
He also questioned whether the thousands of undervotes suggest errors in the vote-counting process. Undervotes happen when a voter leaves some portions of their ballot blank, such as by voting for only one candidate in a race for two seats or by voting for no candidates at all for a given office.
Deputy Attorney General Charles Shadle, who represented the Bergen County Board of Elections, said there were processes to ensure machine ballots were properly scanned and tabulated, even in the case of over- and undervotes.
He added that New Jersey law, which contains no automatic recount provision, does not entitle candidates to a recount unless they show an error was made and the error was large enough to shift election results. Jiang had not done so, Shadle argued.
The Bergen County Clerk’s Office did not oppose the recount request.
“We have found the elections in Bergen County have been fair, and we have no issue with transparency,” said Paul Kaufman, an attorney for the clerk.

(Courtesy of U.S. Forest Service/Rocky Mountain Complex Incident Management Team 1)The state of Idaho has spent almost $9.2 million fighting wildfires this season as state officials prepare for the potential for above normal wildfire activity for most of Idaho through the remainder of the summer.
So far, fewer acres of land in Idaho have burned this year compared to the same time period a year ago, Idaho Department of Lands Deputy Director Bill Haagenson told Gov. Brad Little and members of the State Board of Land Commissioners during a fire season briefing Tuesday at the Idaho State Capitol in Boise.

But with above average temperatures and below average precipitation levels that have stretched from April into July, Haagenson said the potential for wildfire is significant. 
“The significant wildland fire potential outlook for July through September shows above normal fire potential for most of Idaho,” Haggenson said.
To prepare for this year’s wildfire season, Idaho legislators set aside $40 million to pay for wildfire suppression, which was less than $58 million the state spent fighting wildfires last year, the Idaho Capital Sun previously reported. Little had requested even more money to fight wildfires, and last month the Land Board gave the state the approval to pay all of the bills for fighting wildfires – even if expenses surpass available funding provided by the Idaho Legislature. 
So far this year, the state has spent almost $9.2 million on things like use of a helicopter, water scoopers, engines, supplies and teams fighting the Old Greer and Nettleton Gulch fires that started near Orofino and Coeur d’Alene. The state anticipates being able to recover about $1.9 million of that amount for reimbursable expenses, such as sending resources to support fires the Idaho Department of Lands is not responsible for. Reimbursable costs would bring the state’s net costs to about $7.2 million so far this fire season, officials said.  
 New wildfire reported outside of Deary, Idaho

Even though fewer acres have burned, the state has reported 139 wildfires so far this year, state records show.

On Sunday, the Clover Fire burning near Naples in Boundary County threatened structures and led to evacuations that affected about 30 residences, the Idaho Department of Lands wrote in a bulletin issued Sunday. 
By Monday, crews reported making good progress on the Clover Fire, with power being restored to the area and residents being allowed to return home, although residents on Clover Lane were still under a “go” level evacuation order Monday afternoon due to their proximity to the fire.
A new wildfire, the Cherry Fire, was reported Monday night about a mile northeast of Deary, Idaho Department of Lands officials said. Deary is located in Latah County, east of Moscow.
As of Tuesday morning, about 70 people were fighting the Cherry Fire, including two 20-person handcrews, with six engines, a helicopter, two dozers and additional equipment, state officials said.  
Once again this year, a troubling wildfire trend appears to be continuing in Idaho. Year-to-date, 125 of the 139 fires the Idaho Department of Lands staff has tracked have been caused by humans, compared to just 14 fires caused by lighting, according to documents provided to Little and the Land Board on Tuesday.
State officials urge the public to make sure all campfires are doused with water and stirred repeatedly until they are dead out. Officials also ask the public to avoid parking vehicles on dry grass or other vegetation and to remove any chains that may drag behind a vehicle or trailer and could throw off a spark. 
As of Tuesday, there are no fire restrictions in place in Idaho, Haagenson said.

(Photo by Jennifer Shutt/States Newsroom)I am the founder of Planson International Corporation, a family business based in New Gloucester. We supply computer equipment to the United Nations and other humanitarian organizations that support education, health, agriculture, food security, development, and emergency response. Our technology directly supports children impacted by natural disasters and conflicts — and our work is being threatened by efforts to block congressionally approved foreign aid spending.
Companies build market diversification into their business model to survive and grow. Federal investments in foreign aid broaden revenue sources for American businesses. These revenue streams are currently at risk as the U.S. Senate on Tuesday is set to advance a so-called rescissions package that would block billions in spending. This package would drastically cut foreign aid that Congress has always supported. It would weaken the position of the United States in export trade and be detrimental to local economies and small businesses. We must stop this package from becoming law. 
Our workforce’s expertise and ingenuity deliver lifesaving humanitarian aid, while creating jobs and strengthening local economies here at home. Thanks in part to sustained government investment in organizations like UNICEF, my company has grown revenues, expanded our workforce, and developed new products including Planson’s eMITS kits, which were deployed by the UN for several years to set up mobile IT and communications outposts in global emergencies. Contracts with UNICEF and other agencies support Planson jobs for 25 Mainers plus employees in other states.                                                                                                                                  
For decades, America has flexed its technological strength, setting the global pace in innovation and economic growth. My local business proudly contributes to our country’s success. We have improved the speed and efficiency of humanitarian aid delivery systems in many of the hardest-to-reach places on the planet. We will continue to do so if America maintains its support for foreign aid.  
Americans rightly demand that the federal government spend resources efficiently and effectively. Taxpayers want to ensure that their hard-earned tax dollars are invested in American interests. Investments in foreign aid generate a substantial return for American taxpayers. For example, every dollar invested by USAID drove nearly $5 toward the private sector, according to the U.S. Global Leadership Coalition. Of the top 15 export markets in America,13 were once recipients of U.S. foreign assistance. This means foreign aid helps open new markets for American businesses.  
Last year, humanitarian aid organizations like UNICEF invested $770 million in American businesses across 37 states to procure life-saving medicine, ready-to-use therapeutic food, and humanitarian supplies. This created thousands of jobs right here at home. Without these foreign aid outlays, companies across the country would have lost sales.  
Reducing our nation’s traditionally strong foreign aid investments would diminish America’s economic strength, put American jobs at risk, and harm American businesses like Planson International and communities like New Gloucester. For these reasons, Maine’s members of Congress should reject the Trump administration’s rescissions package and reaffirm its support for small businesses and local economies.

(Photo courtesy of Carol Bansley)Dozens of Arkansas fairs and livestock shows will receive a total of nearly $1.5 million from the state Department of Agriculture before June 30 of next year, the agency and Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders announced Tuesday.
The Department of Agriculture’s Fair Funding Program assists fairs and livestock shows with operational costs, facility improvements and livestock-related expenses, according to Tuesday’s news release.
“Agriculture isn’t just Arkansas’ largest industry — it’s part of our way of life,” Sanders said in the release. “The Fair Funding Program helps showcase our farmers and ranchers and gets the next generation excited about agriculture — while also being a great way for small town Arkansas to come together and have fun.”
The funding will be distributed among 80 fairs and livestock shows, including the Arkansas State Fair in Little Rock, as well as the Arkansas-Oklahoma Fair in Fort Smith and the Four States Fair in Texarkana.
The largest grant of $84,000 will go to the state fair. The Arkansas-Oklahoma Fair, the Four States Fair and five other fairs and livestock shows will each receive $54,000.
Fairs and livestock shows “provide opportunities for the next generation to participate in the industry that provides the food, fiber, fuel, and shelter that is critical to the daily lives of every Arkansan,” Agriculture Secretary Wes Ward said in the news release.
The Arkansas Legislature set aside a maximum of $1,095,272 for county fairs via the Fair Funding Program for fiscal year 2026, an increase of $136,000 compared to fiscal year 2025 and $515,000 compared to fiscal year 2024, according to the Department of Agriculture’s appropriation bills.
Fair organizers who receive aid from the Fair Funding Program are required by law to keep detailed financial records and submit annual reports on their uses of the money to the agriculture department and to Arkansas Legislative Audit.

Seven Delaware legislators – consisting of both Republicans and Democrats – are calling for a forensic audit of the Appoquinimink School District.
The letter, addressed to State Auditor Lydia York, claims the request is “in response to recent troubling financial developments,” in Appo, which is the second largest school district in the First State, with 21 schools serving more than 13,000 students.
The lawmakers who requested the audit are Sen. Stephanie Hansen, D-Middletown; Rep. Kevin Hensley, R-Townsend; Kyra Hoffner, D-Leipsic; Rep. Sherae’a “Rae” Moore, D-Middletown; Rep. Eric Morrison, D-Glasgow; Sen. Nicole Poore, D-New Castle; and House Minority Whip Jeff Spiegelman, R-Clayton.

On July 8, the district’s Board of Education approved a 10% increase in the local school tax rate after telling the public that there wouldn’t be a tax hike this year.
“The justification provided for this sudden reversal was reportedly the discovery of a major accounting error that has placed the district in unexpected financial
jeopardy,” the lawmakers’ letter points out.
Urgency surrounding the situation directly relates to the large and growing size of Appo and the resources it provides.
If the legislators get their wish, a forensic audit would:

Determine the cause and full extent of the accounting error
Evaluate whether fraud, mismanagement, or negligence contributed to the district’s current financial condition
Assess whether the district has been in compliance with state laws, internal controls, and proper accounting procedures
Identify any systemic issues that could pose ongoing risks to fiscal integrity
An inquiry into reported inequities by New Castle County as they relate to the county’s 2024 tax collection process

The last of the points, relating to inequities, ties back to an April 2025 comment from Karen Felix, a member of the Appoquinimink School Board Finance Committee, where she stated that “there were major inequities in the 2024 taxing process, where some residence/commercial properties were taxed, and others were not.”
Lawmakers are understanding that new businesses and new residents of the district, after July 1, 2024 (this past fiscal year), were not taxed.
“As a result, tax revenue from those entities were not collected,” the letter stated. “An explanation of the county’s oversight is, therefore, also requested.”
Taxpayers, parents, and educators deserve full transparency and accountability from district leadership, the letter asserts.
“This audit would provide critical information to inform future oversight, budgetary planning, and legislative decision-making,” it read.
Statement from Superintendent Matt Burrows and new tax rates
“Dear ASD Families,

As many are aware, at the July 8 School Board Meeting, the School Board voted to raise the operating tax rate by approximately 10%. Given the ongoing discussion throughout the community, we wanted to share this communication to ensure everyone has accurate information.

Each year, the Appoquinimink School Board holds a board workshop in June and votes at its regularly scheduled July School Board meeting on the tax rate (also referred to as the tax warrant) for the following school year. The new tax rate must be shared with New Castle County by the second Thursday in July each year by law.

As a reminder, there are four components to the tax rate:

Operating Tax: general operations
Debt Service Tax: funds new buildings and major renovations
Tuition Tax: funds special education and other programs as allowed by law
Match Tax: offered local match for specific state programs as allowed by law

At the June Board Workshop and July Board Meeting, information was shared regarding our current financial position. As was shared at both meetings, the amount of money we’ve been anticipating in our “carryover balance” (think of this as similar to your personal savings account) is lower than we were projecting for this year.

I want to share more information about the timeline of events. In May, shortly after our first School Board Workshop regarding the tax rate – the then-finance director first shared concerns about forecasted or projected expenditures. In June – after the former finance director resigned, the district brought in subject matter experts. Those experts made the district aware of the full impact of the budgeting errors – including underestimated employee costs. At this point, the district became aware the financial position report was missing one payroll cycle, which greatly impacted the predicted carryover balance. In addition, it was discovered summer school expenses were incorrectly assigned to a federal account rather than a district account. Alone, these two errors meant that the carryover would be $3.2 million less. All told, when the corrections were made, this resulted in an estimated carryover of only $3.1 million, which is less than the projected carryover and the $4.2 million required by the State. This all was discovered just before the June Board Workshop. To be clear, this was a forecasting or projecting issue of total budget expenditures.

As a district, we are currently conducting a thorough examination of our financial situation to take corrective action to ensure this never happens again. This review will be conducted by individuals with school finance experience outside of our district.

We have always prided ourselves on our fiscal stewardship, particularly as a district that brings in far less local tax revenue based on our largely residential community. Appoquinimink also has the lowest taxes, the lowest tax assessment base, the lowest operational cost per student, the lowest administrative headcount, and the lowest teacher pay in New Castle County. Our district has always been incredibly careful with spending. Our district receives less revenue than all other districts in our county, yet we have the third highest number of students. On a per student basis, Appoquinimink is spending thousands of dollars less than other nearby districts.

In addition to the errors identified regarding expenditures, we also know three key components significantly impacted budget projections this year, including:

rising utility costs
increasing special education population
national teacher shortage and associated costs for recruiting and retaining staff

We have identified $2.5 million in spending reduction for the next fiscal year. We are focused on making reductions that will have the least impact on our staff and students, aligned with our core value of always doing what’s best for every student.

The key areas where reductions will be implemented are:

Department budgets
School building budgets
Staff reassignments
Program/initiative/position reductions

Moving forward, we are committed to a number of processes to ensure this never happens again, including:

onboarding a new finance director
adding additional members with school finance experience to the oversight committee and providing ongoing training
additional financial reporting that will be shared with the oversight committee and School Board

We are also committed to providing ongoing, detailed information to our community as these measures take place.

After much discussion, a combination of cuts and a one-time rate increase was the path chosen by the School Board. Understandably, some community members do not agree with this decision; however, even after this one-time increase, the district’s operational tax rate will remain lower than all other nearby districts, and Appoquinimink will continue to spend less money per student than its peers. This one-time increase is allowable by law only during reassessment. Please know, this measure was used as a last resort to avoid cuts that would greatly impact our students and staff.

Below are the current new tax rates for our district, broken down by category:

Operating Tax: $0.3541
Debt Service Tax: $0.0750
Tuition Tax: $0.1743
Match Tax: $0.0341
Total per $100 assessed value: $0.6375

School Board Meetings in our district take place the second Tuesday of each month. We diligently share meeting reminders on our website, social media, and newsletters. All families and community members are welcome to attend in-person or watch the livestream on our Appoquinimink YouTube channel. In addition to the regularly scheduled School Board Meetings, School Board Workshops also take place periodically throughout the year. These meetings are also shared on our website, social media, and newsletters. Finally, all of our School Board members are available by email to discuss matters between meetings.

Please know that we are committed to our path forward. As a district, we continue to focus on cost reduction measures and will continue to conduct a thorough examination regarding the situation.

Respectfully,

Matt Burrows”

Democratic state Rep. Vincent Dixie of Nashville announced Tuesday he is running for the seat being vacated by Republican U.S. Rep. Mark Green of Ashland City, while Republican state Rep. Jay Reedy of Erin said he decided not to enter the race despite filing paperwork with the Federal Election Commission.
A year after reneging on a decision to step down, Green announced he would leave Congress after voting for President Donald Trump’s spending plan, which narrowly passed with permanent tax cuts for the wealthy and increased spending for border patrol amid reductions for Medicaid, food stamps and clean energy programs.
Dixie accused Green of leaving Congress after voting in favor of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” which he said will “devastate communities.”
“I’m not running from the fight — I’m running to it. Because no one is looking out for the folks who cook our meals, teach our kids, and care for our loved ones. And that has to change,” Dixie said in a statement.
Dixie was the first Black lawmaker to chair the House Democratic Caucus and sparred frequently with Republican House Speaker Cameron Sexton. He passed legislation to give minority students a better chance to take advanced classes in public schools.
Other Democrats seeking the post are state Rep. Bo Mitchell of Nashville and state Rep. Aftyn Behn, who lives just outside the 7th District in East Nashville. Election law only requires a candidate to live in the state in which they plan to run, not the congressional district. 
The district encompasses parts of northern Nashville, Clarksville, and half of Williamson County, as well as about a dozen other Middle Tennessee counties.

Reedy was prepared to enter the race three weeks ago but backed out after exploring his options.
“In the name of conservative leadership, we have much work to finish. I look forward to continuing to serve the people of District 74,” Reedy said in a statement in which he touted the state legislature’s banning of sanctuary cities and repeal of the Hall income tax on investment earnings.
Republicans seeking the post are former Tennessee General Services Commissioner Matt Van Epps, state Rep. Jody Barrett of Dickson, state Rep. Lee Reeves of Franklin, Montgomery County Commissioner Jason Knight of Clarksville and U.S. Army veteran Jonathan Thorp of Clarksville. Mason Foley, who works for Main Street Health, also filed candidate paperwork with the Federal Election Commission. 
Stewart Parks, who served time in federal prison for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021 U.S. Capitol riot — and was pardoned by President Donald Trump  — announced his candidacy at a Benton County Republican Party event last week. 
Gov. Bill Lee set Oct. 7 as the date for the primary election and Dec. 2 for the general election.

The South Dakota Republican is a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity.
The money is in the National Defense Authorization Act, the annual bill that outlines U.S. military funding priorities. The act passed the committee last week.

Ellsworth Air Force Base in Box Elder has been building up in anticipation of the new bomber program. The base will host the first two squadrons of the next-generation bomber, one a training squad and another an operational one. A third squadron would be placed at the base later on.
Rounds did not have a timeline for the delivery of the bombers, but said the inclusion of $3.5 billion in funding for the bomber program in this year’s bill gets it closer to operational.
The B-21 project began in 2015. The planes are meant to replace the B-1 bombers now housed at Ellsworth. Those planes will age out in the next 10-25 years, as B-21s come online.
Rounds said he’s unsure how much the B-21 program will cost in total by the time the planes are placed. He said the government has ordered 100 planes and could end up ordering 200. The price is about $700 million per plane, according to the Air Force.
In construction at Ellsworth alone, Rounds said the federal government is “looking at well over a billion dollars just in terms of the facilities.”
“That doesn’t include the additional infrastructure around the base itself that we’re going to need, the new schools and so forth,” Rounds said.
The authorization bill includes $378 million for construction at Ellsworth.
Rounds also talked up a $28 million allocation for a Watertown National Guard maintenance building and a 3.8% salary increase for military personnel, among other provisions.
The authorization act is the first step toward getting the federal money moving. Congress would need to appropriate the funds in a separate vote, which Rounds said he hopes to see happen sometime this year.
The B-21 Raider program has spurred rapid growth in Box Elder. This year, Gov. Larry Rhoden signed a bill to authorize a $15 million, no interest loan to the community’s Douglas School District to help build space for new students.

(Photo courtesy Petersburg Fire Rescue & Emergency Services)On Tuesday outside city hall, Petersburg officials said yet another night of intense, dangerous rainfall led to major flooding for the third time in a week in the city. While providing updates on the safety concerns and the additional storms rolling in, city leaders explained how the Appomattox River is playing a role in the ongoing overflows. Meanwhile, legislators are touting state-level solutions to manage the recurrent flooding. 
“We had Saturday and Sunday, probably what I would venture to say would be 100 year storms, both days leading into last night,” said Petersburg City Manager John “March” Altman. “Last night, we probably received … probably about 10 inches of rain last night. So this is overwhelming the system.”
The National Weather Service reported that the city has received nearly 8 inches of rain since Saturday morning. On Monday night, rain inundated the region and triggered multiple flash flooding warnings. WRIC reported that some Central Virginia residents had over a foot of water in their backyards and some emergencies required water rescues.
Petersburg Mayor Samuel Parham placed blame not only on the heavy rains, but also on aged water systems that can’t keep up with demand, and lack of dredging in the Appomattox River that allows water to pool in portions of the city. 
The silt filling the river has been an issue for decades. The last time the river was partially dredged was in the 1990s, but the process had to stop partway through near Petersburg once contaminates were found. 
“What we are seeing now are definitely the horrific effects of the many decades of neglect of Petersburg not being able to get the necessary funding to dredge the Appomattox River to prevent a lot of this flooding that you’ve seen pictures of down on Bank in Bollingbrook Street,” Parham said.
Parham said the silt buildup in the harbor area forces water to rush in from the surrounding creeks during these rain events, preventing them from flowing out into the river as they should. There is less movement in the river in these silty spots that makes more parts of town prone to flooding, the mayor suggested.
“So regardless of what we do internally until we can get that water to flow out of that into the Appomattox, it’s going to be a continuous problem here,” Parham said. “So we’re looking at bringing on some public and private partners to hopefully work with the (Army Corps of Engineers) in order to get some funding there to get this dredging done.”
Altman said between the dredging and the water drainage needs, it could take 10-20 years to fully catch up on projects, if they had all the money and resources readily available. There has not been a line in the state budget directly dealing with dredging the river in over 20 years, when an amendment failed to make it into the final draft in 2005.
However, the Virginia Department of Conservation and Recreation this month awarded the city of Petersburg over $2 million to study sediment dredging impacts on the harbor. The city is working to engage the Army Corp of Engineers to finish the 1990s dredging project that left off the critical portions of the river that could help stem the flooding in Petersburg.
“More recently, DCR has invested an additional $4 million to remove silt and replace infrastructure around the stream gates – work that is essential to improving water flow from the Petersburg Harbor into the Appomattox River, thus mitigating flood risk,” said state Sen. Lashrecse Aird, D-Petersburg, in a statement.
City officials reiterated Tuesday that removing some of the harbor silt will help, but the major Army Corps of Engineers project needs to be finished to see even more significant flood mitigation.
“It is decades worth of projects that have built up over time, and now we’re in a position where we need to address those, and we’re going to move forward with a positive plan to address those coming into the future,” Altman said.

The contract covers nurses at Allina Health, M Health Fairview, Essentia Health, Aspirus St. Luke’s, HealthPartners Methodist and Children’s Minnesota.
The contracts include approximately 10% raises over the next three years, plus provisions related to staffing, including a one-year freeze on staffing reductions at Essentia hospitals, according to a press release from the Minnesota Nurses Association. 
Other employees of Essentia Health are currently on strike, alleging their employer is violating federal labor laws by refusing to negotiate in good faith, particularly on staffing issues, union leaders say.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

In June 2021, a deadly heat wave pushed temperatures to 109 degrees in Spokane, Washington, a northern city near the Idaho border, where many homes weren’t built with central air conditioning.
As the heat lingered for over a week, 19 people died in Spokane County and about 300 visited hospitals with signs of heat-related illnesses.
Scientists say it’s not a matter of if, but when, another deadly heat wave descends on the region. To help save lives, the city teamed up with my university, Gonzaga, to start preparing for a hotter future.

  A chart of all deaths, excluding COVID-19, shows the extraordinary impact the 2021 heat dome had in Washington. (‘In the Hot Seat’ report, 2022)
We were excited and relieved when the community was awarded a $19.9 million grant from the Environmental Protection Agency to help it take concrete steps to adapt to climate change and boost the local economy in the process. The grant would help establish resilience hubs with microgrids and help residents without air conditioning install energy-efficient cooling systems. The city doesn’t have the means to make these improvements on its own, even if they would save lives and money in the long run.
Less than a year later, the Trump administration abruptly terminated the funding.
Spokane’s grant wasn’t the only one eliminated – about 350 similar grants that had been awarded to help communities across the country manage climate changes, from extreme heat and wildfire smoke to rising seas and flooding, were also terminated on the grounds that they don’t meet the White House’s priorities. Many other grants to help communities have also been terminated.
Many of the communities that lost funding are like Spokane: They can’t afford to do this kind of work on their own.
 Why cities like Spokane need the help

Like many communities in the American West, Spokane was founded in the late 19th century on wealth from railroads and resource extraction, especially gold, silver and timber.
Today, it is a city of 230,000 in a metro area of a half-million people, the largest on the I-90 corridor between Minneapolis and Seattle. In many ways, Spokane could be on the cusp of a renaissance.
In January 2025, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a $48 million grant to develop a tech hub that could put the Inland Northwest on a path to become a global leader in advanced aerospace materials. But then, in May, the Trump administration rescinded that grant as well.
The lost grants left the economy – and Spokane’s ability to adapt fast enough to keep up with climate changes – uncertain.

This is not a wealthy area. The median household income is nearly $30,000 less than the state average. More than 13 out of every 100 people in Spokane live in poverty, above the national average, and over 67% of the children are eligible for free or reduced lunch.
The city is a light blue island in a dark red sea, politically speaking, with a moderate mayor. Its congressional district has voted Republican by wide margins since 1995, the year that then-House Speaker Tom Foley lost his reelection bid.
 Lessons from the 2021 heat dome

The 2021 heat wave was a catalyzing event for the community. The newly formed Gonzaga Institute for Climate, Water and the Environment brought together a coalition of government and community partners to apply for the EPA’s Environmental and Climate Justice Community Change Grant Program. The grants, funded by Congress under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, were intended to help communities most affected by pollution and climate change build adaptive capacity and boost the safety of their residents.
A key lesson from the 2021 heat dome was that temporary, or pop-up, cooling centers don’t work well. People just weren’t showing up. Our research found that the best approach is to strengthen existing community facilities that people already turn to in moments of difficulty.
Half the $19.9 million award was for outfitting five resilience hubs in existing libraries and community centers with solar arrays and battery backup microgrids, allowing them to continue providing a safe, cool space during a heat wave if the power shuts down.

Another $8 million in grant funding was meant to provide 300 low- to moderate-income homeowners with new high-efficiency electric heat pump heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, providing more affordable utility bills while improving their ability to cool their homes and reducing fossil fuel emissions.
 Communities are left with few options

Now, this and other work is at risk in Spokane and cities and towns like it around the country that also lost funding.
According to the Trump administration, the program – designed to help hundreds of communities around the country become safer – was “no longer consistent with EPA funding priorities.”
A class action lawsuit was recently filed over the termination of the grants by a coalition that includes Earth Justice and the Southern Environmental Law Center. If the case is successful, Spokane could see its funding restored.
Meanwhile, the city and my team know we have to move fast, with whatever money and other resources we can find, to help Spokane prepare for worsening heat. We formed the Spokane Community Resilience Collaborative – a partnership between community organizations, health officials and the city – as one way to advance planning for and responding to climate hazards such as extreme heat and wildfire smoke.
As concentrations of heat-trapping gasses accumulate in the atmosphere, both the frequency and severity of heat waves increase. It is only a matter of time before another deadly heat dome arrives.

Phil Murphy visited flood-damaged Berkeley Heights on July 15, 2025. (Photo courtesy of the governor’s office)Gov. Phil Murphy said his office has communicated with White House officials about the flash flooding New Jersey experienced on Monday, floods that led to the deaths of at least two people and caused extensive damage in the region.
“Last night we got crushed,” Murphy told reporters while visiting Berkeley Heights. “The White House has been in touch this morning, which is a good sign.”
The governor said state and local officials will assess the damage and then decide whether to seek federal aid.
The storm brought 6 inches of rain in just two and a half hours, flooding numerous roadways including the New Jersey Turnpike, and forcing parts of Routes 22 and 28 to close.
Two people in Plainfield died after they were trapped inside a vehicle as it was swept away in floodwaters. Those deaths follow two deaths in Plainfield during a storm on July 3, according to the city’s mayor, Adrian O. Mapp.
“All of Plainfield grieves this latest loss,” Mapp said in a statement Tuesday. “To lose four residents in such a short span of time is unimaginable. We mourn with the families, and we remain committed to doing all we can to strengthen our emergency response systems and protect residents from future harms.”  
The governor described the flooding as part of a pattern of increasingly intense and frequent storms, worsened by climate change.
“That’s the new reality, and we’re getting dragged by this,” Murphy said. “Mother Nature calls the shots here at the moment.”
The storm came the same day the Murphy administration announced it may loosen proposed flood regulations that have drawn criticism from business groups and some Jersey Shore officials. The rules would mandate, among other things, that new and some improved construction be elevated four feet.

Hendricks for CalMatters)An effort is being co-led by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to urge passage of legislation that seeks to generally prohibit federal immigration agents from wearing masks to conceal their identity and requiring them to show their identification and agency-identifying insignia.
The coalition of 21 attorneys general sent a letter Tuesday to members of Congress, expressing concern over escalating incidents involving masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dressed in plainclothes and driving unmarked vehicles detaining people on streets and at homes, workplaces, and courthouses.
“We have watched these detentions with alarm, as the imagery evokes comparisons to repressive tactics that have no place in a free country,” the letter says. “ICE officers’ now routine practice of carrying out arrests in public spaces through masked agents who do not identify themselves as law enforcement has the effect of terrorizing communities rather than protecting them.”

The legislation the coalition is supporting includes the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement, or VISIBLE, Act of 2025, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin.

In a video, Nessel addressed the dangers of immigration enforcement being conducted by agents without identification.
“We’ve already seen cases where bad actors are simulating this behavior to apprehend whomever they want and it’s only a matter of time before an officer is seriously hurt by a good guy attempting to stop what appears to be a kidnapping right before their own eyes,” Nessel said.

In a press release, Nessel also noted that the current ICE tactics contradict Michigan’s resisting and obstructing statute, in which a person is only guilty of those crimes if they knew, or had reason to know, that the individual issuing a command was a police officer. Similarly, officers executing home search warrants are typically required to announce their presence to prevent unnecessary escalation and ensure the safety of both citizens and law enforcement.
While the coalition acknowledged that there may be certain limited instances in which it might be appropriate for federal agents to conceal their identities, they warn in the letter that “widespread, unchecked use of masks and plainclothes enforcement undermines democratic principles, erodes public trust, and invites civil rights abuses.”
Joining Attorney General Nessel in signing the letter were the attorneys general of Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, District of Columbia, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington.

Rob Clements of Elmwood, chair of the Legislature's Appropriations Committee. May 12, 2025. (Zach Wendling/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska ended fiscal year 2024-25 about $86 million below its expected tax revenues, further cementing the budget challenges state lawmakers will face next session. 
On Tuesday, Nebraska’s Department of Revenue released the state’s June tax receipts, revealing net receipts for the month were down about 0.5% from what the state’s forecasting board predicted in April. That drop equates to about $4 million in less revenue headed into Nebraska’s general fund. 
June was the last month of the fiscal year, which spanned from July 1, 2024 to June 30, 2025. Overall, Nebraska’s net receipts for the year were 1.4% down from the forecast, equating to a $86 million drop in expected revenues. 
Legislative Fiscal Analyst Keisha Patent said the receipts mean Nebraska is effectively back in a budget deficit, though the exact number has yet to be determined. 
Budget implications
Lawmakers grappled all session with a projected deficit that fluctuated, growing as high as $432 million. Senators, until the latest update, landed with a budget plan that would have ended the current biennium with a $4 million surplus.
Senators drafted the budget based on projections from the forecasting board’s latest meeting in late April. Following that meeting, Nebraska’s May tax receipts came in more than 14% below their projections, equating to $82 million in less revenue going to the state.

That, combined with the June receipts, led to the $86 million drop. 
While these receipts put Nebraska’s budget balance back in the red, Patent said it isn’t so simple as subtracting $86 million from the $4 million surplus. 
Patent said she would have an update on Nebraska’s financial status at the state’s Tax Rate Review Committee meeting next week.

Biggest factors
The biggest contributors to June’s lower-than-expected receipts were individual and corporate income tax revenues coming in below forecasts, continuing a trend from May. Individual income tax collections were about $30.3 million short, or 11.7% below projections. Corporate income tax collections were $9.6 million short — 6.7% below projections. 
Both Patent and Appropriations Committee Chair State Sen. Rob Clements of Elmwood said the lower individual income tax revenues are likely due to Nebraska’s pass-through entity tax law (PTET). PTET impacts taxes for pass-through entities like S Corps and some LLCs. 
However, it does not impact Nebraska’s tax liability, nor the state’s net general fund receipts, according to the Department of Revenue. It only changes the timeline of when the state is paid, basically which fiscal years see the revenue. 
Multiple other factors could have contributed to Nebraska’s corporate income taxes coming in below forecast, Patent said. Corporate taxes are affected by each corporation’s expected profits and other tax benefits, she said. 
Both Patent and Clements said Nebraska’s phased decreases to its individual and corporate income tax rates also could have contributed to lower revenues, though they noted that the forecasting board accounted for the decreased rates in the group’s revenue projections. 
One category of revenue that increased was miscellaneous taxes, which Patent said includes a number of sources, including the state’s alcohol and cigarette tax. Miscellaneous tax revenue came in $33.3 million higher than expected in June, a 51.3% increase from the latest forecast. 
While miscellaneous taxes have remained relatively stable, Patent said the increase is likely explained in a different way. The transfers lawmakers approved this session from various cash funds to bolster the budget were included in the category, because those dollars added to the state’s general fund, she said. 
What’s next
Compared to May’s receipts, Clements said June’s receipts being comparatively on par with the forecast was “an improvement.”

In his closing remarks of the session, Speaker of the Legislature John Arch of La Vista warned lawmakers that their biggest challenge in 2026 would likely be balancing the budget. The top concern prompting that warning was uncertainty about possible budget cuts from the federal level. 
Since then, passage of the federal budget reconciliation bill has prompted some concerns over whether Gov. Jim Pillen might call a special session to adjust Nebraska’s budget. 
So far, Clements said he hasn’t heard of any federal changes significant enough to warrant a special session, nor has he heard any talk of the governor calling one. The Governor’s Office had no immediate comment Tuesday on whether Pillen might be considering a special session. 
Even factoring in the latest tax receipts, Clements anticipates no need to make new budget adjustments ahead of the next regular session. 
“There’s no cause for alarm at this point,” Clements said.

(Photo courtesy of Utah County Health Department)A mosquito pool in the Lake Shore-North Palmyra area tested positive for West Nile virus, the first in Utah County this season, the county’s health department confirmed on Tuesday. 
The positive mosquito pool was collected during a routine mosquito surveillance effort, the department said in a release. The area was immediately treated after the test result. 
“Since the initial positive test, the same trap location has been tested twice more, with no additional positive results,” the department said. “Utah County Mosquito Abatement teams continue to monitor the area closely while maintaining regular control efforts countywide.”
While most people who become infected with the virus — most commonly spread by a mosquito bite — don’t develop any symptoms, some may experience headaches, body aches, joint pains, vomiting, diarrhea or rashes, according to the Utah Department of Health and Human Services. Fewer than 1% of infected patients develop serious neurologic illnesses, like meningitis. 
Those who think they are infected with the virus should contact their health care providers, the department said.
The Utah County Health Department advises residents to help reduce mosquito breeding and prevent bites by eliminating standing water at home, including in buckets, flower pots, birdbaths, tarps, tires and clogged gutters. Additionally, residents are encouraged to use insect repellent while outdoors, especially at dawn and dusk, and wear long sleeves and pants when possible.

“This is not right,” Uthmeier said during a press conference in Orlando Tuesday. “It still seems insane to me that we’re having this conversation in this country, but we will always fight for what’s right in Florida.”
U.S. Masters Swimming was founded in 1970 and is a national membership nonprofit organization that offers events, swim clubs, and competitions. It released an updated policy regarding transgender participation last month. That change came shortly after Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton launched an investigation over potential violations of Texas law following reports that USMS had allowed a biological male athlete to compete in women’s events in San Antonio in April.
The new policy that went into effect on July 1 now allows USMS members to register for the competition category that aligns with their identity, but for competition purposes athletes will not be included unless they are swimming in the competition category that aligns with their sex assigned at birth. Swimmers who choose to swim in a category that does not align with their sex at birth will no longer be eligible for “Recognition Programs,” but their results will stay in the USMS database.
Uthmeier says that doesn’t cut it.
“They now say that they will reserve, it appears, some competitions for just women but not all, and they have some loopholes where if you go through a transition process you could become eligible again to compete in any one of these competitions,” he said. “This is not acceptable. It does not fly with Florida law. We will use every tool at our disposal from our civil rights laws to our anti-discrimination laws to our consumer protection laws to ensure that we are protecting women and girls.”
Florida laws
Florida’s new Education Commissioner, Anastasios Kamoutsas, said that Florida has become a “beacon of sanity” for women’s sports and women’s spaces, citing legislation in recent years signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis on this issue.
That includes the “Fairness in Women’s Sports Act,” a 2021 law specifying that an athletic team or sport designated for females, women, or girls may not be open to students of the male gender, based on the student’s biological sex listed on the student’s official birth certificate at the time of birth. The law applies those requirements to interscholastic, intercollegiate, intramural, or club athletic teams or sponsored by a public secondary school, high school, college, or university.
There is also the “Safety and Private Spaces Act” signed into law in 2023 providing restrooms and changing facilities for exclusive use by females or males.
Kim Jones, the co-founder of the Independent Council on Women’s Sports (ICONS), said at the news conference that U.S. Masters Swimming continues to allow biological men to compete with women, and said the essential question is whether women and girls deserve access to fair sports — yes or no?
“The state of Florida and AG Uthmeier believes that answer is yes and, unequivocally, so do we.”
The Phoenix reached out to U.S. Masters Swimming but did not receive an immediate response.
The city of San Francisco’s Office of Transgender Initiatives, a local government agency that supports transgender women competing in sports, has said that rather than protecting women’s sports, “bans on trans athletes encourages bullying, discrimination, and even violence against women and girls. These bans can lead to invasive screenings that violate privacy and increase the risk of abuse.”
Public polling
However, public polling consistently shows that most Americans oppose transgendered athletes competing in women’s sports. A Gallup survey released last month reported that 69% of Americans believe that transgender women should only be allowed to play on sports teams that match their birth gender. An NBC News poll conducted of over 19,000 adults in April found that 75% of respondents do not believe transgender athletes should be permitted to participate in women’s sports.
President Donald Trump issued an executive order in February entitled, “Keeping Men out of Women’s Sports.” And last week his administration sued the California Department of Education for allowing transgender girls to compete on girls’ sports teams, alleging that policy violates federal law.
More than two dozen states have laws barring transgender women and girls from participating in certain sports competitions, according to the Associated Press. Some of the policies have been blocked in court.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for the return of political contributions from the now-defunct First Liberty Building and Loan, a Newnan-based lending firm with longstanding ties to the Republican Party.
The company has come under fire after federal officials filed a lawsuit accusing First Liberty’s founder, Brant Frost IV, of running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors out of at least $140 million. According to the complaint, Frost misled investors about the nature of his business while funneling over $5 million to himself and his family members. He also improperly used investor funds to make more than $570,000 in political contributions, the complaint alleged, all of which went to Republican candidates and committees.
Republican U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado has received contributions from Frost.

“I take full responsibility for my actions and am resolved to spend the rest of my life trying to repay as much as I can to the many people I misled and let down,” Frost said in a statement issued through his lawyer. “I will be cooperating with the receiver and federal authorities and ask that everyone allow the receiver time to sort things out and do his best to repair the damage I created.”
The allegations have shocked Georgia’s Republican political network, of which the Frost family has long been a part. In 1988, Frost served as Georgia state director for Pat Robertson, a conservative televangelist-turned-Republican presidential candidate. His son, Brant Frost V, worked as a principal at First Liberty and also served as a former vice-chair of the Georgia GOP. His daughter, Katie Frost, chairs a regional committee for the state party. Until last month, both siblings held leadership roles in the Georgia Republican Assembly, a far-right wing of the Georgia Republican Party.
Past recipients of Frost’s political contributions include Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp — who last received a donation from Frost in 2019 — as well as state Sen. Colton Moore and state Rep. Charlice Byrd, according to data from the Georgia State Ethics Commission. Other out-of-state candidates who have received major contributions from Frost include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Boebert.

Raffensperger, whose office is investigating First Liberty alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission, urged recipients to return political contributions they have received from the company or from the Frost family.
“Now is the time for every elected official, candidate, or political action committee who received financial support from this entity currently under investigation to stand up and help the victims,” Raffensperger said. “Ill-gotten gains do not belong in the State Capitol.”
The Democratic Party of Georgia has also urged Republican officials to return the funds.
“We have just learned that numerous Republican elected representatives are funded by money defrauded from unsuspecting Georgians,” said DPG Chair Charlie Bailey. “Now the question is whether Brian Kemp, the Georgia Republican Party, and all the electeds who received this money will do the right thing and return it to the hardworking Georgians from whom it was stolen.”

(Getty Images))A new Indiana law to address chronic absenteeism in K-12 schools is now in effect, but Hoosier education officials — and at least one state senator — say online misinformation has mischaracterized what the policy actually does.
Senate Enrolled Act 482, which took effect July 1, seeks to improve how schools report student absences to the Indiana Department of Education. 
The law also requires IDOE to publish clearer statewide attendance definitions and guidance for monitoring student participation, as well as a new list of best practices for local districts to employ.
But Sen. Andy Zay, R-Huntington, emphasized Tuesday that the new law does not change how local schools define or enforce their own attendance policies, nor does it expand the state’s authority to penalize families.

A series of highly-circulated social media posts on Facebook, Instagram and X claim the law strips away protections for vulnerable students.
The posts suggest that schools can report students as habitually truant “regardless of circumstance,” and that families affected by homelessness, chronic illness or trauma could be referred to the local prosecutor or child protective services if a child misses at least 10 days of school — excused or unexcused.
Zay said that description isn’t accurate, however.
“There has been a great deal of inaccurate information spread about this bill online in recent weeks,” Zay said in an email to his constituents.
“It is important to know local school districts are retaining their flexibility to decide what counts as an excused or unexcused absence for their students,” he continued. “SEA 482 merely improves the way school administrations report absentee data to the state so policymakers can get a better idea of why students miss school, which is very important since one in five Hoosier students are chronically absent and missing 10% of the school year.”
What the new law does
The law directs schools to more consistently track and report data related to absenteeism so state officials can better understand and respond to the problem.
Under the law, “chronic absenteeism” is now clearly defined as missing at least 10% of instructional days in a school year for any reason, regardless of whether it is excused. That’s equal to about 18 absences per school year.
But local discretion also hasn’t changed. School districts still largely determine where absences fall within three official categories:

Excused absences include illness with a note, funerals, religious observances, college visits, court appearances, and other reasons permitted by district policy. Schools set their own specific policies but must document these absences with appropriate verification, per IDOE guidelines.
Unexcused absences include skipping school, family vacations not approved in advance, or failing to provide documentation for otherwise excusable reasons. These absences count toward truancy thresholds and may trigger attendance interventions.
Exempt absences are those required or protected by state or federal law and do not count against a student’s attendance record. These include jury duty, election service, military obligations, foster care court proceedings, or serving as a legislative page. House Enrolled Act 1660, passed during the 2025 session, further excuses student absences for participation in educational events organized by Future Farmers of America or 4-H.

If a student is expected to miss at least 20 instructional days in a school year due to a medical condition or injury, Indiana law additionally requires the school to provide instruction — but only if a parent submits documentation from a licensed healthcare provider. Schools use that information to develop an educational plan for the student. 
If a student has a documented disability, the team responsible for Individualized Education Programs – IEPs — determines how services should be provided during absences.
IDOE recommends tracking all students’ attendance monthly, with intervention triggers at five total absences, excused or unexcused. Suggested supports include attendance contracts, staff mentoring, family outreach, and referrals for addressing barriers like transportation or health care.
More ‘interventions’ with parents encouraged
The new law allows local prosecuting attorneys to hold “intervention meetings” with parents to help improve a student’s attendance before any legal action is taken, but they’re not required to do so.
Zay clarified, though, that the law does not require a parent meeting for students with excused absences, and county prosecutors are not notified about a student’s absence if they are excused.
Indiana schools get roadmap for K-12 policy changes following 2025 legislative session

That’s different from cases of “habitual truancy,” which was already defined in Indiana law as 10 or more days without an excuse. 
State statute requires superintendents or attendance officers to report a student who is habitually absent from school to the local prosecuting attorney. Prosecuting attorneys must then notify parents if an affidavit of habitual truancy is filed with their office.
Until July 1, 2026, K-8 students also can’t be expelled “solely because the student is chronically absent or habitually truant.” After that date, however, students could be removed from school once again if they miss too many days of class.
Hoosier education officials have flagged chronic absenteeism as a growing, statewide concern in recent years — and especially since the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Roughly one in five Indiana students — roughly 219,00 kids — were chronically absent during the 2023-24 school year, with higher rates among students of color, students with disabilities, and those from low-income families, according to the most recent IDOE data. 
New statistics for the 2024-25 academy year are expected to be released this fall, along with additional IDOE guidance for schools to prevent chronic absenteeism and promote attendance.

The legislation would limit collection and distribution of data concerning reproductive and transgender care, including by prohibiting technology service providers and state regulators from fulfilling federal and out-of-state requests for relevant documents.
The post House ready to instill protections against reproductive rights ‘incursions’ appeared first[...]","THE HOUSE is poised to pass legislation Wednesday that would update the 2022 law shielding reproductive and transgender care in Massachusetts from legal threats that one top Democrat described as a “game of whack-a-mole.”
House Speaker Ron Mariano and two deputies said Tuesday they will bring to the floor a redraft (H 4271) of a Senate-approved bill that implements additional protections for providers and patients including a ban on dissemination of personally identifiable data linked to abortions or other reproductive or gender-affirming care.
Lawmakers pitched the measure as a way to plug gaps in existing state law, warning that the Trump administration and Republicans in other states could target Massachusetts in a post-Roe v. Wade crackdown.
“We thought what we did for [the law] back in 2022 addressed a pressing issue that we were seeing coming down the pipe,” Rep. Michael Day, who co-chairs the Judiciary Committee, said in an interview. “Unfortunately, it seems like this is going to be a game of whack-a-mole with an administration and states that continue to try to get involved in health decisions that individuals are making.”
The legislation would limit collection and distribution of data concerning reproductive and transgender care, including by prohibiting technology service providers and state regulators from fulfilling federal and out-of-state requests for relevant documents, according to a House summary.
Pharmacies could list a practice’s name, instead of an individual physician’s name, on prescription medication labels for reproductive and transgender drugs. Providers, attorneys and non-profit entities would also gain new protections from licensure or insurance consequences for their work in those fields.
The bill additionally seeks to codify a requirement at the state level for hospitals to treat all patients facing emergencies, including when abortion is medically necessary. Some lawmakers and advocates worry the federal version of that law, the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), could be threatened by the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress.
Day described the suite of reforms as “making sure that we’re really buttoning things up.”
Asked if he was aware of any instances of care being targeted in Massachusetts already, he pointed to the US Justice Department’s move last week to subpoena 20 unidentified doctors and clinics for information about “transgender medical procedures on children.”
“It’s only a matter of time before it gets to us if it hasn’t already,” Day said. “I don’t have a specific instance of one of those subpoenas landing in Massachusetts, but there’s nothing precluding that right now.”
“There’s definitely little pieces of incursions coming up, but again, in Mass., we don’t wait for Armageddon,” he added. “We see this coming. They broadcast what their intent is, and so we act first to make sure that doesn’t become a reality here.”
The House Ways and Means Committee voted to recommend the bill Tuesday, setting the stage for a vote of the full House on Wednesday. 
Twenty-one House Democrats on the panel voted in favor of advancing the bill, according to results provided by a committee official. All eight of the panel’s Republicans reserved their rights, meaning they opted against standing for or against the bill during the committee poll.
The poll results did not list any vote taken by Democrat Reps. Rodney Elliott of Lowell, Russell Holmes of Boston, Kristin Kassner of Hamilton, Patrick Kearney of Scituate, Rita Mendes of Brockton, Alan Silvia of Fall River, and Chynah Tyler of Boston.
Democrats hold supermajority margins in both chambers, and they outnumber Republicans 133-25 in the House. Rep. Susannah Whipps of Athol is registered as an independent and Democrat Representative-elect Lisa Field plans to join the House on Wednesday and get its membership back up to 160.
Day said the House redraft is “pretty close” to the version (S 2543) the Senate approved 37-3 — with two Republicans in support and three opposed — on June 26.
House Minority Leader Brad Jones previously said he “appreciate[s] the concerns that have been raised” about patients and providers facing prosecution and tracking for care offered in Massachusetts.
“I start out with sort of a predisposition to say, if you’re in Massachusetts availing yourselves of what are our laws, you shouldn’t face penalty or prosecution in your home state — and if you do, we shouldn’t be a party to it,” Jones, the chamber’s top Republican, said on July 1.
Mariano, who last month signaled an interest in acting quickly on the measure, on Tuesday said the House vote will occur “as the Trump Administration and Republicans across the country continue to target individuals for exercising their right to make their own health care decisions in consultation with their doctor.”
“The Shield Act builds on the Commonwealth’s proud history of preserving and expanding access to reproductive and gender-affirming care by establishing new safeguards around patient data, and by protecting health care professionals who provide that vital care,” Mariano said in a joint statement alongside Day and House Ways and Means Committee Chair Aaron Michlewitz. “Above all else, this legislation is representative of the House’s commitment to ensuring that Massachusetts remains a place where our residents can make personal health care decisions without fear of prosecution.”

Another $45 billion will go to ICE for the detention of immigrants and $450 million in grants to states to partake in border enforcement.Billions more are provided for border security and for the military to partake in border-related enforcement.Andrea Flores, who directed border management for the National Security Council under former President Joe Biden said she expects to see states running their own immigration detention centers similar to the “Alligator Alcatraz” center that state officials quickly erected to hold immigrants. That state-run facility in the Florida Everglades is expected to house up to 5,000 immigrants.Safety for migrants questionedJason Houser, who served as ICE chief of staff in the Biden administration, said the quickly built detention centers will likely create an unsafe environment for immigrants brought there. The lack of experience and training for employees running those centers will also put migrants at risk, he said.""People are gonna get hurt,"" he said. ""They’re gonna die.""He added that with the arrest quotas that immigration officials have been given, roughly 3,000 arrests a day, ""ICE is going to focus on those (immigrants) that are easily reachable, those who have been complying and checking in,"" either with immigration officials or appearing in immigration court.""Hitting quotas is not in the national security interest,"" Houser said.Houser said with the rapid arrest and detention of immigrants, the need for detention centers will likely lead to states building the ""soft sided"" detention centers in ""some of the most rural parts of the country where they cannot be properly staffed and resourced.""Flores said if states work to build their own centers like the one in Florida, there will likely be a lack of oversight because DHS has significantly fired federal employees that ran the watchdog that conducted oversight of ICE — the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.Flores currently serves as the vice president of immigration policy at FWD.us, which focuses on immigration policy and reform.Increase expected in third-country removalsRoyce Murray, a former DHS assistant secretary for border and immigration policy and a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services official during the Biden administration, said she is concerned that the Trump administration will now be able to ramp up third-country removals with the increase in funding.Any removals  to a third country “have to be to a country that is safe,"" she said.If an immigrant has a final order of removal but their home country will not accept their deportation, then the United States typically looks for another country that will accept the removal — a third country.The Trump administration has tried to secure agreements with countries to take deportees, such as Mexico and South Sudan, which recently ended a civil war, but is still experiencing violence. The State Department warns against travel to South Sudan, but the Trump administration won a case before the Supreme Court seeking to use the East African country for third-country removals.Murray said that the Trump administration is using third-country removals to ""create a climate of fear"" and get immigrants to self-deport.She said if third-country removals are going to take place, they ""need to be a place where people can successfully integrate.""",,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

Ron DeSantis on Tuesday marked a major milestone in state’s Everglades restoration efforts — completion of a reservoir designed to hold billions of gallons of water with the goal of preventing recurrences of the toxic algae blooms that have befouled rivers in Florida.
The event, however, came as his administration continues to get hammered by environmentalists for its immigration detention center in the Everglades, which has triggered an ever-widening legal battle over “Alligator Alcatraz.”
The Caloosahatchee River reservoir, dubbed C43, can hold approximately 55 billion gallons of water with a maximum depth ranging from 15 feet to 25 feet. The reservoir captures and stores offloads from Lake Okeechobee if the water gets too high during the wet season and will provide essential water flows to the river during the dry season. The idea is to improve the health of the river and its estuary. 
The four large pumps can move more than 650,000 gallons of water per minute from the Caloosahatchee River into the reservoir.
“We understand that the Everglades is home to a lot of great species, that it provides fresh water to Florida Bay, as well as clean drinking water for more than 8 million Floridians, and it supplies irrigation for the state’s agriculture. So this was something that had been neglected for too long. We needed to take the bull by the horns, and we needed to get it done,” DeSantis said during a press conference at the site.
The event came just days after the administration opened a quickly built detention center deep in the heart of the Everglades at the site of a training airport. Democrats have decried conditions at the center and environmentalists warn the facility — which at last count held nearly a 1,000 detainees — threatens harm to the “River of Grass.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Lawsuit
Several groups filed a federal lawsuit and, late Monday evening, the Miccosukee Tribe of Florida asked to intervene in the case. The tribe is concerned about the potential for harm to the Everglades, noting that there are 10 tribal villages located within a three-mile radius of the site. 
The court filing argues that tribal members have routinely used land at and near the center for hunting and fishing as well as traditional ceremonies. They also fear a security risk.
The court filing insists environmental studies are needed to understand the potential harm from the center, which eventually could hold as many as 3,000 detainees.
DeSantis, however, has contended that the center — toured by President Donald Trump earlier this month — will have “zero” environmental impact and will not undo the ongoing efforts to restore the Everglades.
The governor mentioned the billions of dollars Florida has spent since he became governor to help the Everglades and prevent pollution.

Blooms of toxin-producing algae caused a death of wildlife and wreaked economic damage on the coastal communities that rely on the water for their economic activity. The glow of the blue-green algae made national headlines in 2018 and helped inform the gubernatorial debate that year. While on the stump, then-candidate DeSantis vowed to clean up the environmental mess and immediately issued an  executive order after taking office in 2019 that included expediting the C43 reservoir.
He also appointed a task force to recommend solutions but never acted on its report.
Delays
The project was completed by the South Florida Water Management District after years of  questions and delays including the state firing its contactor. Environmental groups questioned the project because it lacked a water quality treatment facet and said algae could grow in the reservoir.
DeSantis was joined at the press conference by Department of Environmental Protection Secretary Alexis Lambert and Senate President Ben Albritton, who praised the governor for his work on expediting the dam.
“We are one step closer to being able to provide the protection for our coastal communities, making sure that our fisheries remain healthy and bountiful for those that make their living in and around the water in these communities, and it is meaningful for the future of Florida,” Albritton said, adding that the Senate “will be heavily and heartily fighting for Everglades restoration.”

On June 30, the Santa Fe National Forest announced that lightning caused the 176-acre fire and that they were going to “actively manage” the blaze, hoping to encourage low-intensity fire to spread across a roughly 13,000 mile area. 
Noting that the fire was burning in an area that had undergone a National Environmental Policy Act review, and had previously been subject to prescribed burns and thinning, Santa Fe National Forest Deputy Forest Supervisor Anthony Madrid said the fire presented “an opportunity to create a resilient ecosystem that reduces the future risk of catastrophic severe wildfire to communities.”
Since June 30, the Forest Service provided daily updates and smoke alerts. It also provided updates on where it was igniting managed fires to manage vegetation in front of an actively burning fire front. 
On July 12, the Forest Service announced that a spot fire had ignited outside of containment lines the day prior. Before the spot fire escaped, the fire had reached about 12,000 acres and was 87% contained. 
As of Tuesday, the fire is about 15,000 acres and is 40% contained, according to the Santa Fe National Forest.
As a result of the escape, the Southwest Incident Management Team 1 took over the fire Monday morning, according to a Forest Service spokesperson, and is tasked with fully suppressing the fire. More than 250 firefighters and other personnel have mobilized to fight the blaze.

To read more about the project, click here.

As homeowners know, a slow water leak is capable of causing more damage than a fast one. A burst pipe demands an immediate fix, but a leaky pipe can drip indefinitely. Perhaps water seeps out undetected, or repairs get put off in favor of more urgent tasks.
The cost of delay, measured in days or weeks, is minimal, but over years, it can be catastrophic. First it shows up in the form of higher water bills. Give it long enough, though, it can undermine the structural integrity of the house. 
Mississippi has been slowly leaking population for a long time. Over the past decade, the state has lost an average of 5,000 residents per year. The primary cause is outmigration to other states, particularly among recent college graduates – a problem known as brain drain. But rising mortality rates and declining birth rates have also taken a toll on the state’s ability to replenish its population, especially since the pandemic. 
In any given year, the losses amount to a small fraction of Mississippi’s nearly three million residents. Spread throughout the state, the changes can be difficult to notice in everyday life. Over time, however, the trickle has caused a flood. 
Since 2010, 80,000 more people have moved out of Mississippi than have moved in. Put together, they would make up the second-largest city in the state. If such a city existed, it would be one of the best-educated places in the country: four-year college graduates account for all of the net outmigration among people ages 22 to 50.

As a state, we need take a close look at the causes and consequences of our population decline. We must focus particular attention on the brain drain of four-year college graduates, which represents the single greatest challenge for the state’s future. It shapes the lives and livelihoods of every Mississippian, no matter whether they went to college or not.
The brain drain levies a hidden tax on people who remain in Mississippi by choice or necessity. The departure of college graduates reduces average income and job openings for all workers, regardless of their level of education. A smaller population – one deprived of many of its top earners – means all residents must pay higher taxes and utility rates to maintain infrastructure and public services. And a significant portion of every dollar invested in public education, the state’s largest budgetary expense, is converted into a subsidy to the states where Mississippi’s graduates end up working.
The brain drain has begun to erode the foundation of the state’s economy and communities, setting off a cascade of challenges that drives even more people to leave.
Existing businesses struggle to retain talented employees who can earn more money elsewhere, and new businesses choose not to invest when the pool of skilled workers is shrinking. Vacant houses and storefronts blight once-vibrant neighborhoods and downtowns, eating away at property values and family savings. Schools and churches that served as community pillars for generations close or consolidate. This is not the case in every part of the state, but it is a story familiar to many Mississippians.
That’s why Working Together Mississippi, a nonprofit organization comprising hundreds of community-based institutions across the state, is relaunching Rethink Mississippi as an initiative to find solutions to the state’s brain drain and population decline.
I started Rethink Mississippi a decade ago as a website featuring policy analysis and commentary written by young Mississippians for young Mississippians. Two things quickly became obvious: first, Mississippians of all backgrounds share a love for their state that is rare in an era of rootlessness and polarization; and second, the question that dominated all others was whether Mississippi could offer young people enough opportunity to keep them in the state. For too many, the answer has been no. 
I believe that the solutions to the brain drain can be found in the enduring attachment that binds Mississippians to their home state. Even if they have moved far away, Mississippi is never far from their minds or their mouths. Therefore, the best way to find out how to keep people in Mississippi – or how to bring them back – is to ask them.
Through a partnership with Mississippi Today and the Center for Population Studies at the University of Mississippi, we have developed a survey to do just that. We invite you to spend a few minutes taking it. Your insight is valuable, no matter where you are from or where you live now.
A leak will not fix itself. The first step is figuring out the solutions, then we have to do the work. It might be difficult, but it is necessary. We are too invested in our home to let it wash away.

(Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)The Trump administration must allow refugees to enter the United States from countries covered by the president’s travel ban, a federal judge in Seattle ruled Monday.
U.S. District Court Judge Jamal Whitehead’s decision opens the door for around 80 refugees to immediately arrive from countries whose citizens are banned from traveling here.
Whitehead also ruled the Trump administration needs to potentially allow refugees to enter the United States even if their planned travel was postponed before the president took office.
Affected individuals and resettlement organizations, including Lutheran Community Services Northwest in Tacoma, brought the lawsuit after President Donald Trump halted refugee admissions via executive order on his first day in office.
In February, Whitehead, a Biden appointee, ruled the president’s order likely “crossed the line” of separation of powers.
But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later narrowed Whitehead’s ruling to only allow the entry of refugees whose applications were approved before Trump signed the executive order. For refugees to enter the country under the appeals court ruling, they also needed clearance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and travel plans arranged at the time Trump issued his ban on refugee admissions.
That decision from a three-judge 9th Circuit panel didn’t stop Trump from otherwise halting the United States Refugee Admissions Program.
Whitehead ordered the federal government to facilitate entry for refugees who met the appeals court’s three-prong test and had travel scheduled within two weeks of Trump’s order. The feds reported 160 people met those criteria.
Magistrate Judge Michelle Peterson, of Seattle, will review the cases of others whose scheduled arrival date was after Feb. 3. This includes more than 4,000 cases comprising upward of 12,000 potential refugees.
The question before the district court was whether the Trump administration still needed to admit refugees from countries targeted in Trump’s early June travel ban. Refugees from these countries make up two-thirds of those who met the appeals court’s criteria but haven’t been admitted to the U.S. yet.
One of the plaintiffs in the litigation is a Bellevue woman who filed an application to sponsor a refugee family from Afghanistan before the federal government suspended their case. Afghanistan is included in the president’s travel ban.
The organizations involved in the case also fear the Trump administration is undercounting the number of impacted refugees. They say the federal government isn’t including people whose travel plans were postponed for reasons other than the refugee ban, like application processing delays. And some plans may have been canceled in anticipation of the president’s actions.
The Trump administration countered in court documents that those refugees aren’t covered by the appeals court’s order. Department of Justice attorney Joseph McCarter called the request a “baseless and unrestrained expansion” of the ruling.
Whitehead ruled refugees whose travel plans were canceled between Dec. 1 and Jan. 20 are also covered by his order, paving a path for more to arrive in the United States.
Within a week from Monday, the federal government must identify all cases meeting the appellate court’s three-part test, Whitehead ordered.
The government must also expedite the entry of unaccompanied refugee children and Afghan refugees temporarily staying at a camp in Qatar.

(Screenshot)Jefferson County has a confirmed case of measles, which is unrelated to the Central Kentucky outbreak, Louisville officials announced Tuesday. 
Kentucky’s 13th case this year is in a child who recently traveled internationally “to a country that is known to have an outbreak of measles,” Louisville Mayor Craig Greenberg said during his weekly press conference. 
The Louisville Health Department is in the process of tracing contacts with anyone who may have been exposed to the highly contagious disease and will ask those people to isolate in order to prevent spread. 
It’s unknown if the child was vaccinated against measles, said Connie Mendel, Louisville’s chief health strategist. Eleven of the state’s other 12 cases are in people unvaccinated against measles, Greenberg said, and the 12th is in a person who got only half the recommended vaccine series. 
The increase in prevalence of measles, once thought eliminated, comes amid a nationwide decline in routine vaccination. 
“We acknowledge that there are people in our country that don’t want to get vaccinated,” Greenberg said. “I would encourage every parent to just follow the evidence. Look at the facts, follow the advice — the strong, overwhelming advice — of the medical profession, and I hope that will lead them to the conclusion to get their children vaccinated.”
Measles is extremely contagious and spread through the air from coughs or sneezes, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One infected person can infect 9 in 10 unprotected people around them, the CDC says. 
Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, red eyes and a rash. The CDC recommends the measles vaccination series at 12-15 months and then at 4-6 years old. Mendel said it’s especially important to get the full measles vaccination series as schools prepare to open again for the new school year. 
Mendel said anyone who is symptomatic of measles and seeking medical care should call ahead of time and let the medical facility know so they don’t spread the disease to others. 
“Your medical provider can make special arrangements for you to be seen outside of the general public within a medical facility,” she said. “We would go even further, and the patient would come into a side door — because it is that infectious.”

Silt and debris removal projects will move forward as more rains are expected over the weekend, Ruidoso Mayor Lynn Crawford told Source NM. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Feds partially approve funds for Ruidoso flooding disaster

Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.













There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has. 


– There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has. – Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations





Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

(Photo courtesy of Maine ALLCare)Members of U.S. Congress re-introduced the State Based Universal Health Care Act, which, if passed, would automatically initiate the establishment of a board to create a publicly funded health care system in Maine due to a 2021 state law. 
“Maine is ready,” said state Sen. Rachel Talbot Ross (D-Cumberland) at a press conference in Washington, D.C. on Tuesday, joined by members of Congress and legislators from six other states working on state-based universal health care plans.
Maine’s Public Law 391 calls for the establishment of a universal health care plan for the state through a governor-appointed board, but its effective date is contingent on enactment of a federal law opening the door for such a plan.
The Maine law initially started as a bill detailing a plan for a publicly funded, privately delivered health care system, but it was amended to leave all of the details of such a plan to a Maine Health Care Board.  
The federal legislation would create a waiver allowing states to develop their own plans to provide universal health care for their residents via access to federal funding streams. All benefits provided under state plans would have to be at least as comprehensive and affordable as the coverage under the equivalent federal program. 
Healthcare for All Maine, the advocacy arm of Maine AllCare, pushed for the state law in 2021 and is a partner in this federal legislation, which is co-sponsored by Democratic U.S. Rep. Chellie Pingree of Maine. However, with Republican control of both chambers, the current Congress is unlikely to pass the measure.
The re-introduction of this federal legislation comes as 31,000 Mainers are expected to lose their health care in the first year under the a tax and spending package signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, according to a report by Maine’s Department of Health and Human Services. Even before passage of Republicans’ spending bill, more than 40% of Maine’s hospitals had already been at risk of closing but cuts to Medicaid are expected to further increase the strain on hospitals, particularly in rural areas.
“In the wake of the disastrous federal budget that threatens our rural hospitals and the health care of our most vulnerable, the enactment of [the federal legislation] would allow Maine to get right to work in creating a health care program for Maine that would cover everyone and save our rural hospitals,” Julie Keller Pease, chair of Maine AllCare and secretary of Healthcare for All Maine, said. 
The federal legislation would require participating states to propose plans to provide this coverage for 95% of residents within five years and, after that, states would be required to show they achieved that goal and then provide a plan to cover the remaining 5% of the population. 
Different from the waiver flexibility currently provided under the Affordable Care Act, this legislation would also allow states to integrate funds from Medicare, the country’s health insurance program for people ages 65 or older and some younger people with disabilities, into their state plan. Multiple states would also be able to apply for joint waivers to create a regional plan.
“Our current health care system is complicated. It’s inefficient,” Talbot Ross said. “It costs too much and it leaves many uninsured and/or unable to get the care that they need.” 
According to the most recent data available from 2020, Maine had the 10th highest per capita health expenditures in this country. Talbot Ross also cited a survey by Consumers for Affordable Health Care released in 2023 that found more than 70% of Mainers believed that one major illness could bankrupt them. 
This year, the Maine Legislature considered two bills, supported by Maine AllCare, focused on state based universal healthcare. Both failed. 
LD 1269 proposed a comprehensive study to analyze the costs and feasibility of a universal health care plan. LD 1883 offered a detailed blueprint for a state-wide system called the All Maine Health Program that would provide comprehensive coverage to all Maine residents.

(Photo illustration by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Tuesday that West Virginia can restrict access to the abortion pill, dismissing a challenge from drug manufacturer GenBioPro. 
West Virginia lawmakers passed a near-total abortion ban in September 2022, on the heels of Dobbs vs. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, a U.S. Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe V. Wade. 
GenBioPro, which makes a generic form of the abortion drug mifepristone, challenged the abortion ban, arguing that the Federal Food and Drug Administration’s regulation of the abortion drug should preempt the state law. 
With a 2-1 decision Tuesday, the judges court upheld an August 2023 ruling from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West Virginia.
“The district court determined there was no preemption, and we now do the same,” Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson wrote in the 45-page opinion published Tuesday. “For us to once again federalize the issue of abortion without a clear directive from Congress, right on the heels of Dobbs, would leave us one small step short of defiance.
“Appellant GenBioPro finds this clear directive in a maze of provisions in the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. It argues that these provisions vested the FDA with the exclusive authority to regulate access to mifepristone. We disagree,” he wrote. 
In a statement and a post on the social media platform X, Gov. Patrick Morrisey, who defended the abortion ban in his prior role as state attorney general, called the ruling a “big win” and a “pro-life victory.”
“…I am proud to see a victory in this case,” Morrisey said. “West Virginia can continue to enforce our pro-life laws and lead the nation in our efforts to protect life. We will always be a pro-life state!”
GenBioPro produces the majority of the mifepristone sold in the United States. The drug is one of two used in a regimen to end an early pregnancy. The company has held FDA approval for generic mifepristone since 2019, it wrote in a news release. 
The drug manufacturer said Tuesday’s ruling jeopardizes women’s access to FDA-approved medication. 
“The court is allowing the state to continue putting those seeking medication abortion care in harm’s way,” CEO Evan Masingill said in the statement. “The panel’s ruling allows states to restrict access to medications that the FDA has deemed safe and effective, threatening a dangerous ripple effect on the availability of essential medications in this country. 
“As we have always made clear, GenBioPro will not stop fighting to ensure all people can access safe, evidence-based health care,” he said.

(Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)A Court of Appeals panel has ruled that one of three Jewish women suing the state has standing — the right — to challenge Kentucky’s abortion ban. 
Chief Judge Larry E. Thompson and judges Susanne M. Cetrulo and Jeff S. Taylor all agreed on Friday: two of the three women — Lisa Sobel and Sarah Baron — don’t have standing, while the third, Jessica Kalb, does. 
This is because Kalb has nine frozen embryos right now that she’s paying to preserve as part of the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process and doesn’t know how she can proceed with the process under the state’s restrictions on abortion and definition of life. 
Kalb also canceled having an embryo implanted  in 2022 “due to her uncertainty surrounding Kentucky’s abortion laws,” according to the ruling, shared with the Lantern by the women’s lawyers. 
The case now returns to Jefferson Circuit Court, where Judge Brian Edwards can rule on its merits rather than the issue of standing. Standing is the question of whether plaintiffs’ circumstances meet legal standards entitling them to challenge the law. In 2023, the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that abortion providers could not challenge the ban on behalf of their patients. The U.S. Supreme Court, too, has avoided ruling on the merits of abortion bans and instead focused on standing. 
‘Between rock, hard place:’ Will anyone ever have standing to challenge Kentucky’s abortion ban?

One of the lawyers, Benjamin Potash, said the women’s legal team doesn’t agree with the decision that Sobel and Baron don’t have standing, but “we’re happy to move forward with what we’ve got.” 
“I think what we’ve got now is a very solid chance of clearing up this ambiguity in the law and making this law a little bit fairer for everyone involved,” Potash said. 
In a statement shared with the Lantern, Kalb said “I need to call on everyone who stands for religious freedom, women’s rights and those who believe medical decisions should happen in the sacred space between a doctor and their patient to stand with us as we try to explain why these laws are unjust.” 
“I want so badly to grow my family. The current (presidential) administration has claimed to support IVF without understanding how limiting my access to reproductive healthcare is damaging,” Kalb said. “The fact that lawmakers who don’t understand healthcare or my religious beliefs have more rights to my body than I do is sickening.”  
Attorney General Russell Coleman, who is a defendant in the case, said in a statement that “Kentucky law is clear” on this issue. 
“Access to IVF is fully protected for Kentuckians hoping to grow their families,” Coleman said. “We are confident the circuit court will agree once again.”
Is IVF protected in Kentucky? Depends on whom you ask.

‘Not a speculative issue’ 
Kalb previously told reporters that she has polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), which can cause cysts to form in the ovaries and lead to infertility. This condition also means her pregnancies are more likely to end in miscarriage and that she might need an  abortion or other complicated interventions. 
Under the state abortion ban that took effect in 2022 after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the federal right to abortion, a patient must be at risk of death or the permanent impairment of a vital organ.
Meanwhile, “Ms. Kalb is paying money to keep the embryos frozen,” the appeals court ruling states. “Should she continue to do so in perpetuity because the government will not clarify what she can and can’t do with them? No.” 
She “needs the court to clarify her rights,” the ruling states.  
“This is not a speculative issue because these embryos currently exist, and Ms. Kalb is entitled to know her options without fear of potential legal peril,” the judges wrote. “As to Sobel and Baron, there is no impending threat.”
Sobel said she has mixed feelings about the ruling that she and Baron lack standing to challenge the abortion ban. 
“On the one hand, I am glad that the case is moving forward, and I can understand why they supported Jessica in having standing because she does have frozen embryos currently,” she told the Lantern. “On the flip side, though, it feels like they don’t fully understand how the process of IVF works.” 
Sobel is 41 and wants another child, but attempting to have one is a “gamble,” she said. During her first round of IVF, she got four embryos, none of which were viable, she said. In her second round, she got two embryos. 
“I transferred both of those, and only have one living child,” she said. “Knowing that I create non viable embryos more so than I create viable embryos, I don’t want to start down that financial and emotional burden until I understand what the law truly means for somebody like me.”  
Sobel said the ruling that she doesn’t have standing to continue in the case leaves a “big hole” in her community. She is hoping the remaining defendant’s case can proceed quickly and offer her clarity. 
“We hope that (Edwards) will feel pressure to give us a ruling sooner, because our lives are on hold,” Sobel said. “I’m not getting any younger. I’m 41 now, and through the miracles of science, I can probably have a child up until I’m 50. But … we know that that brings extra complications to it, just because of pure biology.” 
‘Preference to Christian values’

The women have argued that Kentucky, in heavily restricting abortion, has imposed and codified a religious viewpoint that conflicts with the Jewish belief that birth, not conception, is the beginning of life.
In other words, the appeals court said, they allege the state is “giving preference to Christian values to the detriment of their Jewish faith.” 
The attorney general’s legal team argued in court that since Kentucky’s law defines pregnancy as a fetus inside a woman, disposing of embryos created during the IVF process doesn’t fall under abortion purview. 
The women’s lawyers, on the other hand, contend that isn’t clearly defined in the law. 
In the coming months, Potash said, the team will need to clear “procedural hurdles” and eventually hold oral arguments again focused on the merits of the case, not standing. Meanwhile, he’s happy the appeals panel found “very little nuance” in Kalb’s standing. 
“We did not have a liberal panel; we did not have a conservative panel. We had a little bit of everything: we had a woman judge; we had two men judges,” Potash said. “We had liberals, we had conservatives. And what it boiled down to is that they studied the law and they got it right. And you can’t ask for more from judges than that.” 
Even though she doesn’t have standing to continue in the IVF lawsuit, Sobel said she will stand “shoulder to shoulder” with Kalb as the case progresses. 
“The IVF community is waiting,” she said. “The Jewish community is waiting to know how this lawsuit will pan out, and we deserve a ruling.”

Article Summary

Congress’ latest budget package slashed federal tax incentives for solar developments. Industry insiders said the latest federal policies create “a lot of uncertainty.”
Illinois facilitates significant funding for the renewables industry, particularly for solar, which provides some insulation against the federal action.
Still, advocacy groups fear energy prices will rise at a faster rate as the federal changes alter the trajectory of renewable energy production in the U.S.
Industry groups are calling on the state to offer more incentives to renewables, notably battery storage.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans earlier this month curtailed federal tax incentives for the solar energy industry and for individuals and companies that purchase solar panels.

The move sent shockwaves through the industry nationwide, pulling key incentives for major projects and residential rooftop solar alike.

But in Illinois, members of the industry say state policy gives a bit of cover. While they have seen a wave of business before Biden-era tax breaks sunset, solar companies are left with uncertainty in the long-term.

Others fear Trump’s actions will drive up prices by slowing the pace of renewables entering the market as fossil fuels exit for economic reasons.

The spending plan that Trump signed into law on July 4 will end several decades-old tax incentive programs between now and 2027. Those programs, which offer credits for rooftop solar systems and investment in large-scale projects, were expanded under the Inflation Reduction Act, a major initiative of former President Joe Biden.

Trump followed the bill signing with a July 7 executive order aimed at quickly ending any subsidies for “expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar.”

Between the spending bill and the executive order, the federal government will also stop offering a tax credit for the manufacture of wind power components and instead offer a similar subsidy to the coal used in steel production.

The new law also denies incentives to any projects that are owned by certain foreign entities or use a significant amount of supplies from those entities, like the Chinese government and its affiliated businesses.

This is particularly difficult for battery storage and solar projects, which often rely on minerals and components mined in or manufactured in China.

This leaves many consumer advocates and energy experts looking to Illinois to further insulate the industry, which is a key part of how the state plans to replace fossil fuel-generated electricity with carbon-free sources by 2045 as required by state law.

Energy price increase

The bill will likely result in higher energy prices across the country, according to an analysis from the REPEAT Project, a joint research effort by Stanford Professor Jesse Jenkins’ Princeton Lab and Evolved Energy Research.

A separate analysis from think tank Energy Innovation, whose CEO was a senior Biden advisor involved in drafting climate change-related legislation, links the cost increases to a reduction in the number of renewable power plants that will be built under the new law.

This will affect electricity capacity markets directly as well as increase the wholesale price of natural gas due to the power sector’s increased reliance on it. Federal data indicates natural gas is currently used for about 17.3% of all electricity generation in Illinois.

Estimates of the scale of the electric bill cost increase for a typical household vary. REPEAT pegs the increase at $280 per household per year by 2035 nationwide. Energy Innovation’s model suggests $170 annual increase by 2035 and $180 in Illinois.

A spokesperson for the Citizens Utility Board, a consumer advocacy group in Illinois, echoed the sentiment and said ending the tax credit programs “is a gut punch to consumers and our economy.”

Solar industry ‘uncertainty’

Jon Carson, the managing partner at Trajectory Energy Partners, said the law is another part of the “solar coaster” — an industry euphemism about the ups and downs of solar tax credits. This part of the coaster, Carson said, will result in less investment.

“This change in law and the uncertainty from the president's executive order, it just means that less projects are going to get built in the short term,” Carson said.

Carson, a longtime campaign and White House staffer under former President Barack Obama, founded Trajectory Energy Partners in 2017.

“We fundamentally believe that this is a real bump in the road for solar, it's a bump in the road for individual projects, but that ultimately the United States needs more power, and it's going to come from wind, solar and battery storage,” he said, referencing three technologies Trump is against.

Others in the industry have raised flags that the “bump in the road” may be more obtrusive for some companies.

The investment tax credit that’s ending under the new law offers a credit of 30% of project costs, with an optional 10% on top of that if a project meets certain labor standards. A similar tax credit exists for both residential and commercial projects.

Brian Haug, president of Oak Brook-based Continental Energy Solutions, said the credit is a “critical” part of Continental’s business model.

“The investment tax credit is a perfect tool that we use to make these projects financially interesting for larger companies,” Haug said.

Continental works on microgrids, rooftop solar and battery storage projects for commercial and industrial customers and claims to be the largest solar installer in the state.

Solar installation companies, customers and individuals still have time qualify for tax credits at the higher, Biden-era rates. Eligible projects must commence construction within the next 12 months or be placed in service by the end of 2027, almost a decade ahead of what was outlined in the IRA.

The rapid sunset has resulted in a short-term boom in requests for solar projects, according to Windfree Solar CEO Eric Heineman, whose Chicago-based company installs solar for commercial and residential projects.

“We don’t know how it’s going to impact us in the long term. What we know in the short term is that we know we have buyers who have been dragging their feet, they’ve got proposals for years with us, and now they’re just coming out of the woodwork,” Heineman said. “They’re signing up left and right.”

But even for projects started today, there’s not a guarantee they will receive any tax benefits from the federal government. Trump’s executive order signaled that his administration could revise guidance on what counts as the “beginning of construction.”

Illinois’ renewable haven 

Illinois has increasingly subsidized the solar industry in recent years, most notably through the 2021 Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, or CEJA. That state law significantly expanded programs like Illinois Shines and Illinois Solar for All, which provide incentives to individuals and solar developers.

At a campaign stop while the Trump-backed spending plan was being considered in Congress earlier this month, Gov. JB Pritzker said Illinois’ policy wouldn’t be affected by the feds’ repeal of Inflation Reduction Act tax credits.

“We put that bill together before the IRA was passed at the federal level, and so we anticipated that we needed to incentivize clean energy, and we did,” Pritzker said on July 2.

Industry experts credit the state’s policies generally, and CEJA specifically, for positioning the Illinois solar industry well as Trump’s policies threaten solar broadly.

Heineman, who was former Gov. Pat Quinn’s director of sustainability, pointed to the state’s solar renewable energy credit, or SREC, programs as a driving factor.

“Our sales are our revenue. Sales are driven by SRECs. If we don’t have revenue, we go out of business,” Heineman said. “Illinois is more insulated than any other state in the country.”

Heineman estimated that a typical solar project takes three years to pay for itself with current incentives. After the federal credit is repealed, it might take five years. Without state incentives, though, it could be as much as 10 years.

Battery credits

Some of the same lawmakers who were involved in passing CEJA are now pushing for a follow-up bill to offer incentives to the battery storage industry. That bill, a version of which was considered in the spring legislative session, could also include regulations of data centers, which are a major contributing factor to decreasing grid reliability and increasing energy prices.

Some environmental groups are using the federal spending plan as leverage to further push state lawmakers into supporting the initiative.

Illinois Environmental Council senior policy manager Cate Caldwell said the state has “long led” on environmental issues and that lawmakers should act in their shortened October legislative session.

“While this federal budget threatens to reverse that progress, Illinois can instead double down on its climate commitments and invest in real, bold climate solutions that modernize our grid, ensure energy-hungry data centers act as good neighbors, and deliver cost savings to hardworking families across the state,” she said in a statement last week.

Hiccups in Illinois’ climate record  

Despite the overall positive sentiments from the renewable energy industry and environmental lobby, the state has failed to live up to the promises it made in the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, according to a report from the state’s auditor general.

That audit report, released last week, found that the state’s Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity failed to properly implement requirements for at least four jobs or workforce programs outlined in CEJA, including ones aimed at finding jobs for people returning from prison and to help communities disproportionately affected by climate change and pollution.

In the report, the Department acknowledged its errors and noted that it had hired someone to manage one of the programs in an interim capacity.

A DCEO spokesperson said the department has made “substantial progress on key initiatives” since the audit was conducted, including approving grant recipients in many of the programs listed in the report and launching community-hubs for people seeking jobs in the renewable sector.

It was later revealed that Lansing police had requested Dewane to issue warrants charging Friske for felony sexual assault, felony assault and a felony weapons offense.

(Courtesy SFCC)If you are like me, you are still reeling from the news that the “big beautiful bill” (which is unparalleled in its ugliness) received the necessary votes in the U.S. House and Senate, along with the president’s signature. Although the U.S. Senate was close (and Dem senators all voted nay) what kind of madness is this? The very notion of passing legislation that dismantles Medicaid; blunts the effectiveness of nutritional assistance; and cuts funding to rural hospitals highlights the degree that a philosophy of philistine self-interest has infiltrated the current political climate. Trepidation over the fallout spreads nationwide.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham says the bill “will hit New Mexico hard” and state officials have outlined nightmarish scenarios in which more than 88,000 New Mexicans lose Medicaid and more than 58,000 to lose their Supplemental Assistance Program help.
“This is draconian,” Victor Pineda, executive director of the Center for Independent Living in Berkeley, California, which provides quality of life assistance to the disabled, reportedly said. “The cuts are a direct hit to our ability to help people stay in their homes who will now be forced into homelessness or institutions.”
In the meantime, what can help supplement the loss of basic services in underserved communities?  What can cities and mayors do?
For one thing: They can put more of their remaining resources toward expanding guaranteed income programs.
In 2018, Mayor Michael Tubbs of Stockton, Calif. initiated the first guaranteed income program in the USA, which for two years gave $500 every month to 125 low-income residents. A study in the program’s aftermath conducted by a team of independent researchers determined that the money significantly improved participants’ mental health and financial standing. Tubbs then founded Mayors for Guaranteed Income (MGI), a network of committed cities that have sponsored pilot programs in cities including Madison, Wis.; Pittsburgh, Pa; New Orleans, La.; and Santa Fe, here in New Mexico.
In 2021, with an MGI grant, Santa Fe Mayor Alan Webber launched a pilot program that provided $400-per-month stipends to 100 young, low-income Santa Fe Community College students with child-caretaking responsibilities. A 2025 independent study again concluded that rather than fulfilling easy cliches — meaning the assumption the young grantees would waste the funds on alcohol or video games — participants experienced meaningful improvements in key takeaway areas
“This successful program directly addresses the fundamental problem that is holding New Mexico back: poverty.” said Mayor Webber, after the report was released.
Today, more than 100 cities have sponsored direct cash payment programs that lasted one year (or preferably two years). In every case, most participants experienced admirable gains in food and housing security.  In Santa Fe, participants experienced a 19 percentage point rise in full employment.
But why should these results be surprising when 37% of Americans say they fear an unexpected $400 expense? A consistent extra few hundred (in lieu of having an empty bank account) can make a difference, a larger-than-expected step forward.
For proponents, an important assurance is that guaranteed income programs come with “no strings attached.” A family that needs money to pay for school supplies can choose this option; a recipient who knows that buying a car would be a valuable investment can save for that. Guaranteed income programs have been praised for having an “entrepreneurial”  spirit. But I believe the better word for them is “self-empowering” in that they encourage the underprivileged to value themselves and invest in their own futures.
These humble sums of cash directed without stipulations at crisis communities, including immigrant families, students or homeless youth, provide a measurable boost. Related programs stipulate the money is spent toward specific goals, like preventing homelessness. Funding for renters facing eviction  is one of the most important ways cities, including Santa Fe, can potentially use targeted funds in a time when homelessness  is at its highest level since the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development began keeping statistics in 2007.

With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.

“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.

The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.

Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.

Weather agency cuts

Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

The River Debris Cleanup Program will include $10 million in state funding provided by the North Carolina Office of State Budget and Management, according to a press release from Monday.
MountainTrue executive director Bob Wagner said in the group’s announcement that the partnership is more than a cleanup.
“It’s a recovery effort grounded in our core values: clean water, healthy ecosystems, and resilient communities,” Wagner wrote.
Federal aid helped with addressing major rivers and large debris after the storm, while MountainTrue will focus on smaller streams and tributaries that are left clogged with trash, broken infrastructure, and storm debris, according to the announcement.
The program will deploy paid cleanup crews across western North Carolina to remove debris from rivers and streams for the next 18 months. It will also communicate with landowners to access and restore hard-to-reach areas.
During the program’s pilot phase, MountainTrue staff and volunteers have already removed about 3 million pounds of debris, Wagner wrote.
With funding from the state, MountainTrue will clean more than 150 miles of river throughout the region. The organization currently has volunteer operations established on the French Broad, Green, Broad, and Watauga Rivers, and will work towards expanding in other areas.
“We’re committed to helping western North Carolina recover and rebuild, and this investment will help clean up debris still left in our rivers,” said Reid Wilson, Secretary of the NC Department of Environmental Quality. “This initiative represents a critical opportunity to restore our waterways, protect our communities and support local economies dependent on outdoor recreation and tourism.”
The program will focus on counties including Alexander, Alleghany, Ashe, Avery, Buncombe, Burke, Caldwell, Catawba, Clay, Cleveland, Gaston, Haywood, Henderson, Jackson, Lincoln, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Polk, Rutherford, Transylvania, Watauga, Wilkes, Yancey, and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mountain-True-clean-up-1024x561.png,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.  Meet Chabeli and read more of her reporting on gender, politics and policy.
A new child tax credit is coming next year, bringing significant changes that will alter how much assistance families receive — and which families can receive it.
With his tax and spending package, President Donald Trump passed a permanent change to the child tax credit spearheaded by congressional Republicans. It goes into effect for families filing income tax returns in 2026.
The changes increase the total amount of the tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200, and index it to inflation so it grows over the years, a change advocates have championed for years. However, the package also introduces new parameters to qualify for the credit that will directly affect immigrants and the lowest-income families.
For the first time, children and at least one of their parents or guardians will have to have a Social Security number to be able to qualify for the child tax credit. That means an estimated 2.7 million American kids who likely qualify for the credit this year will no longer be able to get it as of next year.
The tax credit was passed in 1997. Families have used it to help cover basic needs like food and also wants, like getting their children into extracurricular activities.
But for its nearly 30-year history, the credit has been structured in a way that families with the lowest incomes couldn’t get the full amount. With the most recent change, and because the credit phases in depending on income and the number of children you have, families have to earn more before they can claim the full amount.
Democrats had been pushing to change those requirements in recent years so that the lowest-income families could get more of the credit, but Republicans pushed back, saying it disincentivized people to work.
Under the new child tax credit, an estimated 19 million children are now blocked from receiving the full amount, compared with 17 million currently, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, which has done much of the research and analysis on the child tax credit. The share of children from marginalized backgrounds who are not going to be able to receive the full amount has also gone up for each group:

48 percent of American Indian or Alaska Native children (from 45 percent under the current law)
45 percent of Black children (from 41 percent)
39 percent of Latinx children (from 34 percent)
60 percent of children of single mothers (from 55 percent)
35 percent of children in rural parts of the country (from 30 percent)

“Families of all sizes are going to need higher levels of income to be eligible for the full credit amount,” said Christopher Yera, a research analyst at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. The child tax credit is being cut at a time when other vital services for low-income Americans are seeing reduction.
Under the same tax package, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is losing $186 billion in funding through 2034, affecting eligibility for free school meals and for families that rely on the assistance to put food on the table. Another $1 trillion will be cut from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the next decade.
“All these families that are going to lose access to basic needs, it would be handy if the folks harmed by that were actually reached by the child tax credit,” said Meredith Dodson, the senior director of public policy for the Coalition on Human Needs who has been lobbying for an expansion of the credit.
Here is a breakdown of how the new child tax credit works and how to access it:
What is the child tax credit?
The child tax credit is a return parents and guardians receive in their taxes annually for every child under the age of 17 in their care. Stepchildren, foster children, half siblings and descendants, including grandchildren and nieces or nephews, may also qualify if the tax filer is their main caretaker.
Since 2017, the most families could claim from the credit is $2,000 per child, and that amount goes down after a certain threshold.
Guardians who earn very little or nothing have never been able to claim the full amount of the credit except for in 2021, when it temporarily expanded during the pandemic.
What is the new child tax credit amount? 
For the 2025 tax filing year, the child tax credit will increase to $2,200. Eligible parents will see this amount in their tax returns next year.
The credit will also be adjusted annually to account for inflation beginning in 2026.
Who qualifies for the new child tax credit? 
If filing a single return, parents and guardians must have a Social Security number to access the credit. This is a significant departure from prior years when only the children, but not the adults claiming them, had to have a Social Security number.
For parents and guardians who are filing jointly, only one parent has to have a Social Security number to qualify. That means some mixed-status households will be able to qualify for the credit.
To be able to claim a child, the child has to have:

Lived with the parent or caregiver for at least six months during 2025 (though there are some exceptions)
Lived six months or more in the United States
Have a Social Security number

The shift is part of a years-long effort to limit immigrants’ access to government services. Before 2017, any child living in the United States was eligible for the child tax credit. Then Trump’s tax cuts package in 2017 changed that rule to require that the child have a Social Security number to qualify. Their parents could use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, to file their taxes and still be eligible for the credit. Now at least one of those parents will need to also have a Social Security number.
Families headed by an undocumented single parent, where the child is an American citizen, will not get the child tax credit at all.
“Instead of actually expanding the [child tax credit], they took it away from millions of kids,” Dodson said. “There are important changes [in the law] but they kind of miss the mark when the whole thing is leaving out the folks who need it the most.”
Does everyone who qualifies get $2,200? 
No. Families who earn less than $2,500 a year do not receive anything. After that, the credit begins to phase in depending on how much families earn. (Keep reading for exact figures)
Some families earn little and owe no taxes. Those families are eligible for only a portion of the child tax credit, up to $1,700 in 2025. That means that even if your tax liability is zero, you can still receive a check for up to $1,700 for the child tax credit.
Then, the credit starts to phase out once families earn too much to qualify for the full amount. For a single filer, the credit starts to decrease for any amount they earn past $200,000; for joint filers the threshold is $400,000. Caregivers earning more than $240,000 for a single filer and $440,000 for joint filers do not receive anything.
What is the minimum you need to earn to qualify for the full amount? 
According to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University:

Families with one child: A single filer needs to earn at least $28,700; joint filers need to earn at least $36,500.
Families with two children: A single filer needs to earn at least $33,700; joint filers need to earn at least $41,500.
Families with three children: A single filer needs to earn at least $38,700; joint filers need to earn at least $46,500.
Families with four children: A single filer needs to earn at least $45,800; joint filers need to earn at least $51,500.

Who doesn’t qualify? 
Children who don’t have a Social Security number don’t qualify. Single parents or guardians who don’t have a Social Security number also don’t qualify, even if the child does have a Social Security number.
An estimated 28 percent of children will not qualify for the full amount because their parents earn too little. That is up from 25 percent previously, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Policy at Columbia. The share of kids who are ineligible because their parents earn too much stays the same, at 4 percent.
The states with the largest share of children who don’t qualify for the full amount are Mississippi (40.6 percent), Louisiana (38.2 percent), New Mexico (38.2 percent), Alabama (35.1 percent) and Kentucky (34.9 percent).
How do you claim the credit in your taxes? 
Filers must include their children or dependents on Form 1040, the Individual Income Tax Return, and also complete a Schedule 8812.
Is this like the child tax credit in 2021? 
No. In 2021, that credit was expanded to give families up to $3,600, much of it in the form of monthly checks, instead of an annual lump sum. The 2021 expansion allowed the poorest families in the country, those who don’t file income taxes, to access the child tax credit for the first time in its history. Those pandemic-era changes cut the child poverty rate in 2021 to a historic low of 5.2 percent.
But the temporary changes lasted only a year, and an effort by Democrats to make them permanent failed. The tax credit then reverted back to its usual amount — $2,000 — and the child poverty rate rose to 12.4 percent in 2022.
Is this a temporary change or a permanent one? 
This is a permanent change. Previous child tax credit expansions have been in place for a set number of years and when it was time for those changes to expire, lawmakers renegotiated the new parameters.
That is why the child tax credit came up this year — changes put in place in 2017 were set to expire in 2025.
What the new version does differently is make the changes permanent. Lawmakers can still tweak the credit if they want to later, but there is no set date where the changes will end and the credit will revert back to a former amount.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/GettyImages-1367212888-2048x1365-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

(Whitney Downard/Indiana Capital Chronicle)A trio of Indiana’s budget leaders iterated their confidence in the state’s finances at the end of the 2025 fiscal year with $2.5 billion in the bank.
“Hoosiers can remain confident that our financial footing is stable, despite a year marked by economic fluctuations and a lower-than-expected forecast,” said State Comptroller Elise Nieshalla. “Our reserve continues to serve as a practical safeguard, reflecting Indiana’s commitment to fiscal responsibility.”
In April, the state projected it would receive $2 billion less than expected in a revenue forecast, forcing lawmakers to scramble to make cuts near the tail end of the 2025 legislative session. Indiana’s fiscal year starts on July 1 and ends on June 30.
“It was a bleak day, if you recall,” summarized Lisa Hershman, the secretary of Management and Budget. “We were clinging, I would say, and hoping for a $14 million surplus. I’m proud to say, we far exceeded that.”
The surplus for the 2025 fiscal closeout was $337 million, a number buoyed by advanced tax payments usually paid in December.
“So next year, we start out down $160 million,” said Rep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis.
DeLaney and Rep. Greg Porter, another Indianapolis Democrat, noted that the closeout doesn’t factor in the impact from President Donald Trump’s “Big, Beautiful Bill,” which will cost Indiana hundreds of millions of dollars.
“I have asked the budget director to get us that information … and not wait for the (next) forecast in December. Because the legislature needs to know and the public needs to know what the impact is,” DeLaney continued.
That $2.5 billion reserve amount is enough to fund state government for 40 days with no new revenue, within the 30-60 day range considered generally advisable.
Reserves will be 11.2% of Indiana’s spending, at the lower end of the 10-15% recommended to maintain Indiana’s AAA bond rating.

(Courtesy of Save the Bay)The embattled Quidnessett Country Club is facing more scrutiny after failing to submit the required restoration plan of its shoreline to state coastal regulators by the July 10 deadline.
The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council is scheduled to revisit the matter at its upcoming July 22 meeting, according to a July 14 letter from agency staff to Jennifer Cervenka, one of Quidnessett’s attorneys. The letter was obtained by Rhode Island Current. 
The letter does not specify whether the appointed council will take additional action, including new penalties, against the North Kingstown country club for an illegal seawall built along its shoreline more than two years ago. That will be up to the council to decide, Jeff Willis, executive director for the CRMC, said in an email.
Robin Main, another attorney representing Quidnessett, declined to comment when reached by phone Tuesday. 
CRMC orders Quidnessett to come up with a plan to remove seawall, restore shoreline

The saga of the 600-foot-long rock wall built in defiance of state coastal regulations has become a flashpoint in ongoing debate over the effectiveness and fairness of the politically appointed state coastal panel. Critics condemned the council for a drawn-out review of Quidnessett’s case that so far, has had no consequences for the country club despite clear violations of state coastal requirements for sensitive waters. The CRMC issued a cease and desist to country club owners in August 2023 after discovering the seawall built along the edge of its golf course, sometime in the winter of the prior year. 
Facing financial penalties, the country club owners originally sought to ease development restrictions by reclassifying the waters along its coastline. If granted, the request could have allowed a permanent barrier like a seawall. After a protracted review and series of contentious public hearings, the council rejected the water type reclassification in January. Since then, the club and agency staff have been unable to agree on details of a shoreline restoration plan, including the slope and location of a natural barrier between the water’s edge and adjacent golf course. Quidnessett submitted five plans to the CRMC, all deemed by staff as  “unacceptable” based on state coastal regulations.
In June, the dispute returned before the appointed council, which finally set a timeline for the country club to remove the seawall and restore the shoreline. The council’s unanimous June 11 vote gave Quidnessett 30 days — until July 10 — to submit a new restoration plan, with another three months to perform the work after a plan was approved.
However, the council’s June vote failed to prescribe any details of what the forthcoming restoration work should entail, despite a recommendation from staff environmental scientist Brian Harrington laying out specific requirements for replantings and the location of the “toe of berm.” 
Jed Thorp, advocacy director for Save the Bay, was unsurprised to learn Quidnessett failed to turn in a new plan by the deadline, given the lack of clarity in the council’s prior order.
“The council should have known that without providing that specificity, we’d be back here in 30 days with no agreement reached,” Thorp said in an interview. 
“Quidnessett was basically saying, ‘We need to be told what to do,’” Thorp said of what Cervenka said during the June 11 meeting. “Hopefully, the council responds in some way that provides clarity and more clearly directs them on what needs to be done.”
Thorp characterized the repeated delays and inaction by the council as further support for Save the Bay-backed bill that would have reshaped the CRMC as an administrative agency akin to the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The bill failed to advance out of committee in both chambers during the 2025 legislative session — the third consecutive year — though lawmakers agreed this year to a more modest tweak to the council’s size and members’ professional qualifications. 
“If you had more of a DEM-style structure, this would have been resolved months ago,” Thorp said. “Instead, we’ve seen delay after delay after delay.”
The CRMC will next meet at 6 p.m. on Tuesday, July 22, at the William E. Powers Department of Administration building in Providence. A meeting agenda has not yet been posted.

Milky skies were carrying smoke and haze from Canadian wildfires across northern and central Vermont on Tuesday — prompting state officials to issue a two-day air quality alert across the state. 
Smoke and haze rolled in early Tuesday morning and are expected to linger through the afternoon and night, according to Tyler Danzig, a meteorologist for the National Weather Service in Burlington. 
Officials warned that sensitive groups should take breaks and monitor their conditions when spending time outdoors. 
Individuals with heart or lung issues, older adults, children, people who work outside and those experiencing homelessness are especially at risk, according to state health officials. Sensitive groups can spend time outside but should take more breaks than usual, according to officials. 
People with asthma are recommended to keep medication handy. Those with heart disease should watch out for palpitations, fatigue and shortness of breath. 
Sensitive groups could continue to feel the effects of exposure up to 24 hours after the haze has passed, according to Danzig. 
The alert spans across Grand Isle, Franklin, Orleans, Essex, Chittenden, Lamoille, Caledonia, Washington, Addison and Orange counties. 
Officials recommend Vermonters sign up for air quality alerts, limit their exposure and keep an eye on forecasts. 
The smoke and haze are coming from wildfires in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Manitoba, Danzig said. Many of those fires have been ablaze for weeks and caused similar conditions in Vermont earlier this summer.
Skies may tinge orange this evening, but the air should clear overnight, Danzig said. The alert stands all day Tuesday and will likely be extended for another day, according to Bennet Leon, who monitors air quality for the state Department of Environmental Conservation.

(Photo by Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)DE SOTO, Kansas — Hundreds from around the world gathered Monday to celebrate the grand opening of the Panasonic electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto and tour the 4.7 million-square-foot facility that claims the tag of the state’s biggest economic development project ever.
The Japanese ambassador to the United States, Panasonic leaders, and local, regional and national elected officials praised the partnership required to bring the project to fruition. Panasonic is expected to invest $4 billion in the plant, and the Kansas Department of Commerce estimates it will bring $2.5 billion to the state’s economy annually.
The state offered $829 million in incentives to Panasonic through the Attracting Powerful Economic Expansion Act, or APEX.
“Just two and a half years ago, November 22, we stood on this very ground,” said Allan Swan, president and chief operating officer of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America. “At that point, it was just a big open field, but we had a whole vision to build a world-class facility that would power the future of clean transportation, create thousands of jobs, new high-quality jobs, and serve as the catalyst for economic growth in Kansas and across the region.”
“Today,” he said, “that vision is a reality.”
One week ago, the first production line began operating, and it will take three to four months for it to achieve full capacity, Swan said after the ceremony.
By early January, Swan said, three additional lines will be operating and construction will begin on a second wing of the building, which is expected to house an additional four lines in about 18 months.
Currently, the plant makes about 50,000 battery cells per day — at a rate of about 70 per second — and employs 1,100 people, Swan said. It is expected to employ 4,000 people when at full capacity.
Reports by international media that decreased Tesla sales will delay the move to full capacity are just part of being in a new business, Swan said.
“We’re in a brand new industry,” he said. “That industry is going to ebb and flow a little bit as she grows, and she will grow, and we’re clearly growing in one direction. It’s not going to change. The beauty of Kansas is we can build these lines out. We’ve got customers that want them, so we should be in a good place.”
Batteries won’t begin to ship out to customers for three or four weeks because of rigorous safety and quality testing, Swan said.

 The marketplace

Customers who will use the electric vehicle batteries in their products were in attendance, including representatives from Lucid Motors, Toyota, Harbinger Motors and Tesla. Nick Twork, spokesman for Lucid, said they were pleased to see a new plant built.
“It’s really great because obviously it allows us to have a domestic supply chain for battery cells,” he said. “This facility will start supplying us next year, and we’ll ship batteries to our factory in Arizona.”
Upcoming changes to U.S. policies, like eliminating tax credits for buying electric cars, aren’t really something that concerns Lucid, Twork said.
“As long as it’s a level playing field, that’s the most important thing,” he said. “Obviously that’s going to affect the marketplace, so we’ll adapt as necessary. We’re an agile business, and we’ll do what it takes.”
Twork said he wasn’t willing to comment on any acrimony the public is feeling about Tesla products and reports the company’s sales are down.
“From our standpoint, we’ve had six consecutive quarters of record growth for the company,” he said. “We keep selling more vehicles, so more and more customers are finding out about
what Lucid has to offer.”

 Supply chains

U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran spoke at the ceremony and afterward said trade negotiations need to take place to get rid of barriers that keep U.S. products out of international markets.
“But as I’ve indicated to the ambassador today, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that the outcome of those conversations between Japan and the United States are beneficial to both countries,” Moran said.
The federal government wants supply chains brought home, he said.
“This is an example of where business that was being done outside the United States will now be done in the United States,” he said of the Panasonic plant.
Swan said Panasonic is working to bring more suppliers to locate in the United States. Three already have space in the De Soto plant.
“It’s an ongoing process, and we’ll keep working with our suppliers who already exist to see whether we can get them here to the United States, or find another way of creating a stronger supply chain,” Swan said.
There are still 6,000 acres near the plant that could be used for expansion or where suppliers could build. Swan said the company would like to see that developed and is working with the state of Kansas to bring suppliers “as close as possible.”
Swan praised the De Soto plant as the largest plant his company has built with top-of-the-line manufacturing capabilities.
“We built the first one with Tesla over in Nevada, so that’s their factory. This is our factory,” he said. “We’ve redesigned it to make it quite more productive. There is roughly 10% less machinery here and a lot more automation, so that’s where the innovation comes in. The lines here are the fastest lines that we’ve ever had.”
The labor-saving production lines are expected to achieve approximately 20% higher productivity compared to the Nevada factory, a press release said.
 Workforce training

All of those who spoke Monday highlighted the partnerships that it took to make such a large project successful. Speakers repeatedly mentioned the collaboration with local community colleges to help the company train the workforce it needs.
Greg Mosier, president of the Kansas City Kansas Community College, said new programs at the school train Panasonic’s entry level skilled maintenance technicians and advanced engineering technicians.
The program is a mix of schooling at the community college and working at the Panasonic plant, he said.
“We developed it in partnership with Panasonic, and then it’s also 16 credit hours, so they get a college certificate with it as well,” Mosier said. “It’s an apprenticeship model, so they are on the regular 16-week schedule. They do two days at the college, three days at the factory.”
In response to a Panasonic request, the community college was able to condense the program to eight weeks, he said. After completing the course and working full time at Panasonic, Mosier said, students are earning $50,000 to $60,000 per year.

 Japanese investment

The investments Panasonic is making in Kansas will strengthen the state’s economy and do much more, said Yasuaki Takamoto, CEO of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America.
“What happens here is just the first step in building a stable and secure domestic supply chain, one that’s becoming a reality thanks to our ongoing investment and partnership,” he said. “We are supporting domestic production with critical EV components, strengthening North America’s manufacturing ecosystems and helping America maintain its competitive edge.”
Takamoto said that selecting Kansas for the plant meant choosing the community and the workforce they believed in.
“Since then, we built relationships that will last for years to come,” he said.
Japanese ambassador Shigeo Yamada highlighted the strong relationship between the United States and Japan, saying Japan has been the strongest investor in the United States in the past 50 years and has created 1 million jobs.
“Japanese investment in this country is about much more than just dollars and cents,” he said. “By working hand-in-hand with local communities, Japanese companies are building enduring ties and a sense of trust with their peoples. These personal ties — connections — form the very foundation on which the bilateral relationship is built and allowing us to collaborate, not just as allies, but as trusted friends.”

Photo by J.W. Hendricks for CalMattersAn effort is being co-led by Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel to urge passage of legislation that seeks to generally prohibit federal immigration agents from wearing masks to conceal their identity and requiring them to show their identification and agency-identifying insignia. 
The coalition of 21 attorneys general sent a letter Tuesday to members of Congress, expressing concern over escalating incidents involving masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers dressed in plainclothes and driving unmarked vehicles detaining people on streets and at homes, workplaces, and courthouses. 
“We have watched these detentions with alarm, as the imagery evokes comparisons to repressive tactics that have no place in a free country,” the letter says. “ICE officers’ now routine practice of carrying out arrests in public spaces through masked agents who do not identify themselves as law enforcement has the effect of terrorizing communities rather than protecting them.”SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
The legislation the coalition is supporting includes the Visible Identification Standards for Immigration-Based Law Enforcement, or VISIBLE, Act of 2025, co-sponsored by U.S. Sen. Elissa Slotkin.
In a video, Nessel addressed the dangers of immigration enforcement being conducted by agents without identification.  
“We’ve already seen cases where bad actors are simulating this behavior to apprehend whomever they want and it’s only a matter of time before an officer is seriously hurt by a good guy attempting to stop what appears to be a kidnapping right before their own eyes,” Nessel said.

In a press release, Nessel also noted that the current ICE tactics contradict Michigan’s resisting and obstructing statute, in which a person is only guilty of those crimes if they knew, or had reason to know, that the individual issuing a command was a police officer. Similarly, officers executing home search warrants are typically required to announce their presence to prevent unnecessary escalation and ensure the safety of both citizens and law enforcement.  
While the coalition acknowledged that there may be certain limited instances in which it might be appropriate for federal agents to conceal their identities, they warn in the letter that “widespread, unchecked use of masks and plainclothes enforcement undermines democratic principles, erodes public trust, and invites civil rights abuses.”

With temperatures edging past 90 degrees by midday, faith leaders and community members gathered outside Binkley Baptist Church on Saturday in Chapel Hill, holding signs and silent prayers as part of a statewide solidarity fast to demand humanitarian aid for Gaza. 
They stood beneath the July sun as an act of moral witness, urging U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis to help ensure aid reaches civilians in the war-ravaged Palestinian territory, where United Nations officials say Israeli restrictions have allowed only a fraction of necessary food and medical supplies to enter.

“Palestinians say despair is betrayal,” said Mark Davidson, executive director of Voices for Justice in Palestine and one of the event’s organizers. “When we give up because it seems hard or depressing or hopeless, we’re abandoning people.” 
The vigil marked the 35th day in a rolling statewide fast led by Jewish Voice for Peace-Triangle and supported by groups like Durham Friends Meeting, Bullhorn Arts and Education, and the NC Environmental Justice Network. Members fasted for 24-hour shifts in rotation, abstaining from food and water in symbolic solidarity. 
“We’re not called to be successful, we’re called to be faithful,” Davidson said. “Do the right thing, and amazing things can happen.” 
The gathering comes as the war in Gaza has left large parts of the territory flattened, and nearly 60,000 Palestinians killed, the majority of them civilians.  
Israel launched its military response following the October 7 Hamas attack that killed some 1,200 people in southern Israel, according to Israeli authorities. 
Human Rights Watch have accused Israeli officials of using starvation as a weapon of war, a claim Israel denies.  
Participants echoed those concerns. They called for Tillis, who co-chairs the Senate Human Rights Caucus, to back restoring U.S. funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), and to push for halting additional weapons shipments to Israel.

“I would love for us to actually put that funding to the aid we’re claiming to try to put in,” said Kate Lindrum, a member of Jewish Voice for Peace-Triangle. “No matter how governments or politicians may want to spin it, people are out here, and you can’t just tell them to not believe their eyes.” 
Organizers framed the event as both a spiritual act and a political one. Rev. Dr. Marcus McFaul, Binkley Baptist’s senior minister, described the vigil as an extension of the church’s core mission. 
“Having food, shelter, and dignity is a moral issue,” McFaul said. “Churches deal in moral concerns and moral ethical issues.”

The event was notably multifaith, bringing together Christians, Jews, and secular activists. Organizers said Binkley Baptist is the largest faith community yet to join the NC to Gaza Solidarity Fast. Other participating groups include Makom Triangle, Farm Church, and Durham Community Fridges. 
Davidson reminded those gathered of words from Nelson Mandela: “It’s impossible until it is done.” 
The group plans to continue fasting in shifts throughout the summer, aiming to sustain public pressure and attention. 
“This isn’t just for a week, it’s not even for a month, it’s not even for a year,” McFaul said, quoting late civil rights leader John Lewis. “It’s for the long haul.”",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7122313-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.

As North Carolina continues its recovery work from Helene and the recent flooding from Tropical Storm Chantal, Gov. Josh Stein has made clear that continued assistance from FEMA remains essential. In a recent interview with CNBC touting the state’s top ranking for doing business, he echoed the view that states are in no position to handle disaster recovery on their own.
“It doesn’t make sense for each state to have a fully staffed emergency response team because they may not have a storm for five-years or 10 years. But we know the country will,” Stein said. He added that North Carolina still has an $11.5 billion request for storm recovery before Congress and the Trump administration that he hopes will be funded “soon.”

Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-15 15:47:13+00:00,CT Mirror,"HHS ban on serving undocumented clients a ‘fundamental shift,’ CT health centers say",Jenna Carlesso,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/15/ct-health-centers-undocumented-immigrants/,"A Trump policy change has left CT’s health centers wondering whether they can continue serving undocumented residents, a key patient base.","Federally qualified health centers across Connecticut are facing uncertainty about whether they can continue serving undocumented residents — a key patient base — following a recent move by the Donald J. Trump administration to reverse a decades-old policy that gave people without permanent legal status access to certain federal benefits, including care at community health centers, behavioral health programs and Head Start.
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services last week announced it would bar undocumented residents from accessing taxpayer-funded federal programs. Among the more than a dozen initiatives affected is the Health Center Program, which provides funding to community-based health providers.
Connecticut has 17 federally qualified health centers with more than 300 facilities. The centers serve about 440,000 people annually statewide, including more than 70,000 who are uninsured. 
Of those, officials estimate that anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 patients per year are undocumented residents, who are charged for services based on a sliding fee scale. The health centers don’t have a more precise number because employees do not inquire about patients’ immigration statuses, said Deb Polun, chief strategy officer for the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut.
For now, the FQHCs are continuing to serve everyone who shows up for care while they await further information from HHS, Polun said.
“There is a lot of fear and confusion,” she said. “It’s a fundamental shift in how health centers do business. Our mission is to try to serve all residents, to help create healthier communities, to help people get and stay healthy so they can live high quality lives and contribute to their local economies. This changes the way they will have to do business. It will lead to people being sicker.”
Without access to primary care at community health centers, Polun said, more people will put off treatment and end up in hospital emergency departments when medical care is badly needed.
“We’ve already had patients fearful of becoming detained or deported, so we’ve seen a change in some of the behaviors — more cancelations, more, ‘Can we switch this to telehealth instead of coming in?’ This is one more obstacle, one more barrier to them being able to access health care,” she said.
Leaders at community health centers say the move is complicated by federal regulations that also require them to provide care to all residents in their service areas.
“Community Health Centers are required by federal law to ensure access to health care for all residents in their service areas. This is core to their mission to build healthier communities,” Shawn K. Frick, CEO of the Community Health Center Association of Connecticut, said in a statement. “[The] notice from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services raises significant questions about how community health centers in Connecticut and across the country can continue to meet their legal and moral obligations.”
The move could mean having to ask for and verify patients’ immigration statuses at facilities and turn away people who receive coverage through the state’s HUSKY for immigrants program, which offers government-sponsored health benefits to certain undocumented residents, officials said. As of April, 15,600 kids in Connecticut were enrolled in the program.
Aside from undocumented immigrants, access to care could also be rolled back for children covered by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy, refugees and individuals granted asylum under the new rule, health officials said.
Attorney General William Tong said his office is “evaluating all legal options” in response to the recent notice.
“When you deny huge swaths of people access to affordable community-based health care, their medical needs do not go away,” Tong said in a statement. “They get sicker, their problems become more severe, more life threatening and more expensive to treat. And then they show up in emergency rooms — often too late. No one thinks this is a good idea — not the health centers, not the hospitals, and least of all not the Connecticut families who will be hurt by this needless cruelty.” 
Sen. Saud Anwar, D-South Windsor, co-chair of the legislature’s Public Health Committee and a physician, called the move “short sighted.”
“We know the cost of health care goes up for everyone if preventive treatments are not provided. People residing in our communities, if they receive preventive treatment, they are less likely to have emergencies,” he said. “If treatment is not received because of fear or other decisions, the actual cost of health care for everyone will increase, and this is not a good financial decision.”
In a joint statement, Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield, and Sen. Heather Somers, R-Groton, said they did not interpret the announcement as a ban on services for undocumented residents.
“Per the administration, they have stated that these efforts are aimed at protecting taxpayer-funded benefits and vital resources for American citizens,” the senators said. “There does not seem to be any indication that someone who has illegal status cannot seek medical services at a federally qualified health center. The difference now is that they would have to pay for that service and the taxpayers would not be on the hook for their care. Federally qualified health centers are one of the least expensive options to access care. We are monitoring developments closely and will be talking to key stakeholders.”
Christine Stuart, a spokeswoman for Connecticut’s Department of Social Services, said the office is still assessing the impact of the federal decision on programs and on the state’s partner organizations.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-15 15:40:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Tired of slow drivers in the left lane? A new law targets ‘camping’ in CT,John Henry Smith | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/15/ct-law-left-lane-drivers-camping/,"A new CT state law will allow police to ticket drivers who ""camp"" in the passing lane without actively passing another vehicle.","If you’ve ever been stuck behind a slow driver cruising in the far left lane of a highway, Connecticut lawmakers are aiming to make your commute a little smoother.
Starting Oct. 1, 2026, a new state law will allow police to ticket drivers who “camp” in the passing lane without actively passing another vehicle.
“We are talking about all people, but mostly impeding the flow of traffic,” said State Sen. Christine Cohen, D-Guilford, who sponsored the legislation.
Clearing up the confusion
Cohen, a member of the General Assembly’s Transportation Committee, said the goal is to make left-lane expectations clear: “Folks say, ‘Why are people getting in the left lane and driving 50 miles per hour when the speed limit is 65?'”
Although current law technically discourages prolonged left lane driving, Cohen said it’s vague and ineffective.
“It says we shall drive in the right-hand lane, but doesn’t say anything specifically about left lane camping,” she said.
Connecticut is joining states like Massachusetts and New York in making the rule more explicit.
Reasonable exceptions
Cohen emphasized the law has exceptions.
“If there’s a left-lane exit that you need to get off, if there’s some sort of obstruction requiring you to get in the left lane, and of course, most of all being [for] passing vehicles that are on your right, those are all allowed,” she said.
She added that the rule won’t apply to two-lane highways.
Enforcement will be discretionary
Drivers traveling above the speed limit aren’t exempt. If they stay in the left lane for too long without passing, they could still be ticketed.
“That would be considered camping,” Cohen said. “The goal is to encourage drivers to treat the left lane as a passing lane and not a cruising lane.”
But how will police determine when someone’s been in the lane too long? Cohen said there is no specific mileage threshold.
“This is discretionary and law enforcement will be trained accordingly,” she said. “There would have to be a clear violation and infraction.”
Equity and awareness
Cohen said some initial concerns focused on potential inequities in enforcement. To address those, the law includes time for public education.
“We’re going to give the Department of Transportation time to create an awareness campaign around this,” Cohen said. “This is something that is taught in driver’s education classes, but now we have the clarity necessary on the books.”
Signage will also be added along highways before enforcement begins.
Learning from other states
Connecticut’s catching up to states like Massachusetts and New York, who already have similar laws in place, Cohen said.
“And what we’ve seen from other states is that when drivers really understand and respect the ‘keep right, pass left’ principle, roads just become less stressful and less congested and run more efficiently,” she said.
Cohen says she hopes the new law helps create a more cooperative driving culture.
“If we can all have some uniformity, particularly in the region,” she said, “that’s going to help us all.”

(Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)HAYS — The leaders of the state’s new Water Program Task Force say they are committed to finding elusive solutions to the state’s long-simmering water crisis.
Sen. Kenny Titus, a Republican attorney from Wamego, and Rep. Jim Minnix, a Republican farmer from Scott City who chairs the House Water Committee, appeared alongside Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly at a ceremony in Hays to outline their vision for the task force. The two lawmakers will co-chair a bipartisan group that includes business leaders and conservationists.
Their mission: Evaluate risks to water quality and quantity, build a management system that addresses those risks, and secure a dedicated revenue source to ensure the plan, like so many before, doesn’t just sit on a shelf.
“No big deal, of course,” Titus joked as he addressed a crowd that gathered on July 9 at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History to celebrate the passage of House Bill 2172, which established the task force.
  Sen. Kenny Titus delivers a historical overview of the state’s attempts to address water challenges. The Water Plan Task Force will build upon past plans, realized and unrealized, he says. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
“Our current challenges did not arise overnight, nor have they arisen from a lack of past efforts to address them,” Titus said.
He recalled efforts in recent history to address the state’s water crisis, including a previous task force, proposed restructuring of state agencies, increased funding for the state water plan, infrastructure investments, and “countless meetings and discussions.”
“But the problems have always been complex and long term,” Titus said. “Simple solutions have been elusive. We have in many cases talked the problems to death, and it’s been done generation after generation, and here we are with challenges persisting.”
The task force’s job, he said, is to build upon past plans “and help set a clear course for the state’s future.”
  Rep. Jim Minnix says he has full faith that Kansans can work together to address water issues. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Minnix said his hope is for the task force to “lay out a plan” in the next several years “to improve things dramatically.”
“I have full faith that we as Kansans can come together in a nonpartisan way and work on issues of water — and there’s a lot of things to work on, folks,” Minnix said.
At the ceremony, he had the responsibility of introducing the governor, but he had been busy with harvest and hadn’t prepared remarks about her.
Still, he set aside for a moment the “really pretty press release” her office had given him to read, and instead told the crowd know how much he enjoyed working with the governor.
“I really appreciate that she’s very genuine, has a good sense of humor, puts up with a lot of things there in Topeka,” Minnix said.
  Gov. Laura Kelly says the state’s water problems will get worse without immediate intervention. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Kelly, who said later that she felt the same way about Minnix, reminded the crowd in Hays of the challenges the state faces, and the importance of the task force.
The challenges include stabilizing the Ogallala Aquifer, reducing sediment in reservoirs, and ensuring access to reliable and safe drinking water and wastewater systems.
Some areas of the state have less than 25 years of usable water left, and 150 communities are at or above acceptable nitrate levels in drinking water, the governor said.
“These problems are here and now, and if we don’t act, they’re only going to get worse, and perhaps beyond repair,” Kelly said.
She said the task force is about more than just “creating a plan.”
“Plans tend to sit on shelves,” Kelly said. “This is about creating a funded, coordinated system of management that will set us up for the future, protect our communities and strengthen our economy.”
She pointed to Hays as a leader in implementing “an all hands on deck approach to water conservation.”
  Hays Mayor Sandy Jacobs says her city has been a leader in conservation efforts for years. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Hays Mayor Sandy Jacobs said city residents consume just 65% of the statewide average of water per capita. She praised the water task force as a way to address “critical challenges” surrounding water quality, conservation and management.
“Here in Hays, we understand firsthand how vital water is in our communities, our economy and our future for agriculture to infrastructure to environmental health,” Jacobs said.
The city for three decades has been mired in bureaucratic and legal wrangling over a plan to pipe water from a ranch in a neighboring county. Meanwhile, Jacobs said, the city voluntarily reduced its water supply by 30%, implemented a rebate program for water-saving toilets and appliances, hired the first water conservation specialist, and has educated elementary school children on “the benefits of using water wisely.”
Educational outreach efforts include support for a 4-H water ambassador program for teens and an annual poster contest that now draws 600 entries.
  Holly Dickman, water conservation specialist for Hays, appears in front of a display of children’s posters at a July 9, 2025, celebration of the new Water Plan Task Force at the Sternberg Museum of Natural History in Hays. (Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)
Holly Dickman, water conservation specialist for Hays, said the poster contest, which draws youth and adult entries, is one of the ways she educates the community about water conservation.
“You have to talk about it constantly to get the message out,” Dickman said.
She said Hays has been working to conserve water since the early 1990s while other communities are just getting started.
“We’re very conscientious about water use here,” Dickman said. “We actually get asked from other communities about how we do things, about some of our programs.”
The 4-H water ambassador initiative draws youths to learn more about water conservation and help educate others, said Jonas Kern, 17. He was a member of the group of teens who started the program, all from Barton and Ellis counties.
He and his brother, Russell Kern, 16, are ambassadors and understand the importance of water conservation after working on their family’s Barton County large-scale vegetable farm. In the ambassador program, they visit other areas to learn about challenges.
“We do a lot of programs presenting,” Jonas Kern said. “Last year, we went over to Garden City to learn about the different agriculture that they have to do there because it’s a lot drier than where I’m from in Barton County.”
Jonas Kern presented at the Governor’s Water Conference about the 4-H program and how other counties could start one. He’s interested in learning more as he plans for his future.
“I’m looking to maybe be a high school science teacher,” he said. “Water is one of the most important natural resources.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7090226-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-15 15:18:52.516073

Whether you’ve stayed, left, or considered leaving, we want to hear from you. If you’ve moved to Mississippi from elsewhere, or even if you’ve never lived in Mississippi, your input is valuable. Brain drain in Mississippi affects all of us, and we believe hearing from people of any and all backgrounds and perspectives can only help us better grapple with the problems and develop some solutions.

Take the survey

The short survey asks everyone about the factors that influenced their decision of where to live, whether that’s in Mississippi or not. It follows with tailored discussion questions based on where you’re from and where you live now. We ask you to reflect on what has pulled you away or what has kept you rooted here, as well as the potential changes that could improve the chances that you live in the state in the future. We purposefully left plenty of room for you to share your own thoughts with us.
Over the next few weeks and months, we will spend dedicated time and energy with the results of the survey. We’ll dispatch journalists at Mississippi Today to dive deeply into issues that matter most to you, and we’ll work closely with our expert partners to dissect and share findings — all with potential solutions to the crisis at top of mind.

What is brain drain?
Brain drain refers to the departure of educated or skilled workers from an area, often in pursuit of higher-paying jobs or better living conditions. It is a pithy term for what economists call human capital flight. Brain drain can be measured according to gross brain drain, the share of educated residents born in the state who leave, and net brain drain, the relative outflow and inflow of educated residents. Unless otherwise specified, we will use the term brain drain to refer to net brain drain, which is the more important metric for the state’s economy and well-being. 
Brain drain also frequently shows up in connection with two related concepts: net outmigration and population loss.
Net outmigration occurs when the total number of people leaving an area exceeds the number of people moving in. Net migration includes both domestic migration, when native-born Americans move within the U.S., and international migration, when people move from and to foreign countries. In practice, places with net outmigration typically also suffer from a brain drain, because people with higher education tend to be more mobile than people without college degrees. 
Population loss is a decline in the total number of residents living in an area. Population change is calculated by a simple formula: net migration + natural change (births minus deaths.) A place experiencing net outmigration can still sustain a growing population if its birth rate is high enough to offset its deaths and departures. However, state and national birth rates have been sliding downward for decades, so population growth increasingly depends on positive net migration.

Why is brain drain a problem?
Brain drain is a vicious cycle that slows a place’s economy, shrinks its tax base, and frays its social fabric. When an area’s workforce and customer base shrinks, existing businesses lose talent and revenue, and new businesses do not open. Infrastructure and public services deteriorate as fewer — and less affluent — taxpayers shoulder the cost of maintaining them. Vacant houses and storefronts blight once-vibrant neighborhoods, inviting crime and lowering property values. Schools close or consolidate, and religious congregations and civic organizations die out. Each wave of departures leaves less reason for others to stay, perpetuating the downward spiral.
Brain drain widens regional, socioeconomic, and political divides. Americans have the freedom to move anywhere in the country, and many “vote with their feet” by leaving places that offer less opportunity, fewer amenities and worse quality of life than they can find elsewhere. But even though all Americans are free to move, moving is not free. High costs and uncertain job prospects often lock poorer, less educated and older residents in struggling places. The people most likely to leave are wealthier, more educated and younger. Brain drain widens these disparities: the people who can leave are often rewarded with higher salaries and upward mobility, while people who are stuck in declining areas struggle to hang on. It also amplifies the inequality between regions. Areas with economic and social advantages pull talent and resources away from places like Mississippi that are, literally, left behind. The gap between them is increasingly filled with political polarization and cultural resentment. 
Brain drain is a subsidy paid to other states. Mississippi taxpayers invest approximately $170,000 in the education of a child who passes through the state’s K-12 and public university system. When a graduate leaves to take a job elsewhere, the return on that investment is reaped by their new state. Mississippi imports far fewer graduates from other states than it exports. As a result, the taxpayers of the poorest state in America are subsidizing the economies and education systems of wealthier states, while Mississippi is left with fewer resources to invest in its communities and its next generation.

How many people is Mississippi losing? 
From 2010 to 2024, 80,000 more residents left the state than moved in, according to Census Bureau estimates. Put together, the net loss is greater than the population of Gulfport, the state’s second-largest city. Mississippi had the sixth-worst net migration rate in the country during that time. 
Net outmigration accelerated from 2010 to 2020, and it overtook the natural growth of the population starting in 2014. However, the Covid-19 pandemic put the brakes on the exodus. In the three years prior to 2020, Mississippi lost an average of 12,000 movers per year. In the three years from 2022 to 2024, 5,000 more people moved into Mississippi than moved away — the first period of inbound migration since the 1990s. Domestic movers still left Mississippi on balance, but their losses were offset by an increase in foreign immigration.
Despite the uptick in net migration, Mississippi’s total population has fallen faster since the pandemic. The state’s birth rate has declined in line with national trends, while deaths from Covid and other causes have spiked since 2020. In the past four years, 16,000 more Mississippians have died than been born. 
As a result, Mississippi’s 2024 population stood at 2,943,045 — down nearly 45,000 from its peak in 2014. The state ranks 49th in population change during the past decade, above only West Virginia. Mississippi now has almost 27,000 fewer residents than it did in the 2010 Census.

How does migration vary by education?
As we laid out before, there are two ways to define brain drain: gross brain drain, which compares the education levels of leavers and stayers, and net brain drain, which compares the education levels of leavers and newcomers. Of the two, net brain drain is the more important metric, but gross brain drain is the one we feel more, since it is easier to notice the loss of someone who moved away than someone who never moved in.
Gross Brain Drain: Among Mississippi natives ages 22 to 50, almost half of all four-year graduates have left the state, compared to just 30% without a four-year degree. This includes graduates of community colleges, who stay home at the same rate as Mississippians without any postsecondary education.

Net Brain Drain: For every Mississippian without a four-year degree who moves away, a person of a similar educational level moves in. But only two university graduates arrive for every three from Mississippi who leave, resulting in a net loss of 57,000 four-year graduates currently living in other states. 

Jump to the top.

How does migration vary by age, race, and sex? 
Age: Every age group younger than 50 departs Mississippi in greater numbers than they arrive. Only when approaching retirement age are people more likely to move to Mississippi than leave. Losses are greatest in the years when people are beginning their careers. From 2010 to 2020, Mississippi lost one-tenth of its 25-to-34-year-old population – about 40,000 people – through net outmigration. 

Race: Net migration among Black and white people follows a similar age pattern. However, Black people move away at higher rates in their 20s and 30s, but they are more likely to move back in their 70s. Mississippi’s population of other racial groups is too small to generate reliable estimates by age. 
Sex: Both men and women move in line with the overall age pattern, but net outmigration is higher among men in their prime working years. 

Jump to the top.

What parts of the state are losing the most people? What places are growing?
Nearly every part of the state is suffering from outmigration and brain drain. Between 2010 and 2020, 80% of the state’s 82 counties lost more people than they gained, including moves made inside the state and outside of it. Nationally, roughly half of counties were net exporters of population. 
Most of Mississippi’s shrinking counties are shrinking rapidly, while most of its growing counties are growing slowly. From 2010 to 2020, more than half of Mississippi’s counties ranked in the bottom 20% nationally in net migration rate (net migrants as a share of population). Only five counties ranked in the top 20%. 

There are patterns to which counties tend to lose or attract movers. Rural counties with low per capita income and low education rates lost the most people, while growth was concentrated in more affluent and educated places: suburban areas, university towns, and the Coast. Most of their growth came from people who moved from other parts of Mississippi — a brain drain within the state. 
Jump to the top.

Where do Mississippians go? Where do newcomers move from? 
When Mississippians leave, they typically relocate to large metropolitan areas that are within driving distance of home. According to address changes in IRS tax filings from 2012 to 2022, the top destinations for people leaving Mississippi are Houston, Dallas, Memphis, Atlanta and New Orleans. Newcomers are most likely to move to Mississippi from Memphis, New Orleans, Mobile, Baton Rouge and Atlanta. 
In terms of net migration, Mississippi has added the most residents from Memphis, New Orleans, Mobile, Baton Rouge and Birmingham, while it has lost the most residents to Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta, Nashville and Orlando.

On a state level, Tennessee and Texas have drawn the most Mississippians, followed by Louisiana, Alabama and Florida. People who move to Mississippi tend to come from the same five states, in a slightly different order. Tennessee and Louisiana are the top two states of origin, followed by Texas, Alabama and Florida. 
Even though the same states appear at the top of both lists, net migration varies widely by state. In general, Mississippi has a negative migration rate with states that are attracting newcomers from other parts of the country, while it has a positive migration rate with states that are losing residents to other parts of the country. 
Texas added the most residents in exchange with Mississippi: 30,000 net movers between 2012 and 2022, which is triple the amount gained by Georgia, the number two state. Alabama, Florida and Tennessee round out the top five. 
Mississippi netted the most residents from Louisiana, followed by Illinois, New York, California and Michigan – all states that, like Mississippi, have suffered from domestic net outmigration. 

Jump to the top.

Is the problem that too many Mississippians leave or too few people move in? 
Both, but, on balance, Mississippi does a worse job of attracting new residents than retaining current residents. For every 100 people alive today who were born in Mississippi, 36 now live in another state. Mississippi’s retention rate ranks in the middle nationally, 28th out of 50, but it is lowest in the Southeast, where people are less likely to leave their home state than in other regions. 
However, for every 100 people born in Mississippi, only 24 people move in from other states. Another two move in from abroad. The in-migration rate ranks 46th in the country.
The population of people alive today who were born in Mississippi is 3.27 million, 10% larger than the state’s current population. Louisiana is the only other Southern state that is home to fewer people than were born in the state.

How does Mississippi compare to other states? 
Mississippi ranks near the bottom nationally on brain drain, net migration and population change. 
Net migration of four-year college graduates, ages 22 to 50: 47th
Total net migration since 2010: 45th
Population change since 2010: 48th
Louisiana is the only other state in the country to rank 45th or worse in all three categories. It makes sense that Mississippi would be in league with its neighbor to the southwest, but Louisiana also has unique economic and ecological challenges. Within the Southeastern region, Mississippi and Louisiana are extreme outliers. 
The South is the country’s fastest-growing region, and every other state in the region has experienced net in-migration, brain gain and population growth. This includes Arkansas and Alabama, the two states that are most similar to Mississippi in economics, geography and history. Arkansas and Alabama are growing slowly by regional standards, but they sit around the midpoint in national rankings.

Arkansas and Alabama share many of the characteristics that are blamed for Mississippi’s brain drain. They are both poorer and less-educated than the Southern average, and they get labeled with many of the same negative stereotypes. They are the South’s most rural states behind Mississippi, and they do not have a major urban magnet like Dallas, Atlanta or Nashville. Yet Arkansas and Alabama have steadily grown their population by attracting and retaining residents, including university graduates. Since 2020, both have seen a surge of newcomers.

What is the economic cost of the brain drain?
Mississippi’s state economist published a study in 2022 that estimated that the brain drain of university graduates costs the state’s economy an average of $181 million per year. The model was based on retaining 1,200 more four-year graduates per year from 2023-2032 earning an average of $36,569. The study only calculated the additional economic benefits on a yearly basis, but we can extend it over the entire decade. If Mississippi retained 1,200 additional graduates per year for 10 years, and they all stayed in the state so that the state’s population with a bachelor’s degree increased by 12,000 by the end of the decade, then the state economy would grow by a total of $8 billion. (The impact grows exponentially, as previous cohorts continue to receive a paycheck, combined with the additional earnings from each year’s new influx of graduates.) An extra $8 billion would double Mississippi’s economic growth rate from the most recent decade. Those gains would also benefit workers without a degree: the state economist’s model predicts that the 1,200 additional four-year graduates would create almost 1,200 jobs elsewhere in the economy. 
For a real-world example of how this could play out, compare Mississippi’s economy to Arkansas’ economy. In 2010, Mississippi and Arkansas were roughly equal in population and economic output. Mississippi had 45,000 more people and its GDP was $7 billion smaller. Between 2010 and 2024, Arkansas added 200,000 more residents than Mississippi and attracted 42,000 more four-year graduates. By the end of 2024, Arkansas’s economy was $31 billion larger than Mississippi’s — tripling Mississippi’s growth rate. 

We can also think about the brain drain in terms of a loss on the investment made by taxpayers. State and local taxpayers contribute $8,494 per year toward the education of every public K-12 student and $14,662 for every public university student. These numbers change every year — they’ve risen about 25% since 2000 after accounting for inflation — but, as a crude estimate, a Mississippi student who completes 17 years of education in public schools and universities will receive about $170,000 in direct educational investment from their fellow Mississippians. This doesn’t include other indirect investments that benefit kids as well as adults: infrastructure, healthcare, police, firefighters, etc. 
Mississippi residents pay an average of 9% of their annual income in state and local taxes, which means that a university graduate would need to earn almost $1.9 million in the state simply to repay the up-front investment. At the median income for university graduates, that would take 36 years. The state auditor’s office reported in 2022 that 40% of in-state graduates are not employed within the state within five years of finishing their degree. Since Mississippi only attracts two graduates from other states for every three it loses, a large portion of the state’s education funding turns into a subsidy to other states. As of 2023, the brain drain had cost Mississippi 57,000 four-year graduates between ages 22 to 50 who were born in the state. Collectively, they represent approximately $7 billion in educational expenditures after inflation.

What are the political implications?
Population loss most directly influences political representation through congressional reapportionment, which takes place after the U.S. Census every 10 years. In 2000, Mississippi’s congressional delegation shrunk from five to four because it had grown more slowly than other states. If current trends hold, Mississippi is likely to retain its fourth seat in 2030, but it will be in jeopardy by the time the 2040 Census comes around.  
Population changes have influenced the redrawing of congressional maps within the state. The 2nd District, held by Democrat Bennie Thompson, had to be expanded after the 2020 Census because it lost 9% of its population in the preceding decade. The 2nd District now covers one-third of the state’s land area, and it will continue to grow geographically as long as the Delta region and Hinds County lose population. It’s likely that would mean adding more white voters to the state’s only majority-Black district, which could trigger a Voting Rights Act challenge. It could also alter the demographics of the majority-white 1st or 3rd Districts. 
Similarly, the latest round of legislative redistricting has set off a fierce series of political and legal battles that is still ongoing. After Republican lawmakers approved new district maps on party-line votes, lawsuits brought on behalf of Black voters have forced 15 districts to be redrawn and their seats contested in special elections this year. In general, population changes in recent decades have shifted legislative power away from rural Mississippi and the city of Jackson and toward suburban areas and the Coast. 
As for statewide elections, the effect of population changes exists as a hypothetical: would Mississippi elect different candidates if fewer people were leaving? Since 2010, net domestic outmigration has cost Mississippi at least 100,000 citizens who would have been of voting age by the state elections in 2023. It would not have swung the outcomes of many races, since most of Mississippi’s recent elections have been decided by wide margins. But it could have had an impact on the 2023 race for governor, for instance, which incumbent Republican Tate Reeves won over Democrat Brandon Presley by fewer than 27,000 votes. It’s impossible to say whether an extra 100,000 eligible voters would have swayed the final result, but it’s clear that the political ripple effects will only get larger if Mississippi continues to lose more people.

What causes the brain drain? Is it mostly about jobs?  
People choose where to live based on a variety of individual factors, but every person of working age has to take job opportunities into account. Some people move to maximize their income, some move to get a job they love, and others move to a place they want to live where they can find a job that pays the bills. 
There is no doubt that Mississippi’s economy is a major driver of the brain drain. Jobs often pay less than equivalent positions in other states, even after accounting for cost of living differences. According to the most recent American Community Survey data, Mississippians with bachelor’s degrees earn 23% less than the national average. Mississippians with graduate degrees earn 27% less than their counterparts. The Bureau of Economic Analysis estimates that Mississippi’s cost of living is 13% cheaper than the national average.
People born in Mississippi who leave the state are rewarded with higher incomes at every level of education, but moving is especially lucrative for four-year graduates, who make almost $19,000 more than graduates who stay.

Mississippi also has fewer jobs available in fields that require a bachelor’s degree or specialized training. Roughly one-third of Mississippi natives in their 20s and 30s have completed a four-year degree, but Georgetown University’s Center on Education and the Workforce estimates that just 24% of jobs in Mississippi meet their qualifications, the lowest in the country. They project that share to stay level through 2031.
In-state job opportunities vary widely according to industry. In general, Mississippians who work in education and healthcare are most likely to stay, while those in STEM fields are the most likely to leave. However, Mississippi attracts fewer workers than it loses in each of the 15 most common professions for people born in the state. Losses are greatest in computer science and IT. For every 10 Mississippi natives currently working in tech, eight have left the state, and only three people have moved in from other places. As a result, the state’s tech workforce is less than half as large as it would have been without the brain drain.

How much is rural depopulation to blame? 
The longstanding migration pattern has been for people to move from rural areas and small towns to big cities and suburban areas. This trend places Mississippi at a structural disadvantage, since Mississippi has the fourth-most rural population in the country and no large metropolitan area.
However, population density does not tell the whole story. Counties in Mississippi have underperformed counties of similar sizes across the board. Between 2010 and 2020, Mississippi counties under 25,000 people lost movers at more than twice the national average, and Mississippi counties between 25,000 and 50,000 people had a net outmigration rate of 6%, compared to flat migration nationally. Mississippi’s larger counties attracted more people than they lost, but at slower rates than peer counties outside the state.

What role do Jackson’s struggles play?
Most states have been able to offset their rural depopulation through the growth of their metropolitan areas. The Jackson region accounts for one-fifth of the state’s population and is Mississippi’s only metro area among the 100 largest in the country (it ranked 95th in 2024, with 606,000 residents). But in contrast with many fast-growing midsized Sunbelt cities, the Jackson area is losing population.
The city of Jackson has lost almost one-third of its population since 1980, with no sign of leveling off. From 2020 to 2024, Jackson lost more than 12,000 residents, the largest per capita drop among the 324 cities with more than 100,000 residents.  

Historically, the surrounding suburbs have absorbed most of Jackson’s outmigration. Since 1980, their population has grown by nearly 80% and the metropolitan area has added 140,000 residents. However, in recent years, the growth in the suburbs has also tapered off. Over the past four years, 14,500 more people have left the Jackson metro area than moved in, the fifth-worst net migration rate of any metro area with at least 500,000 people. From July 2023 to June 2024, the most recent year available, the Jackson region ranked last in the country, losing twice times as many people per capita as any other major metropolitan area.
At the same time, people have flocked to similarly-sized regions in neighboring states. Huntsville, Chattanooga and Northwest Arkansas are growing rapidly by attracting newcomers, including many young professionals who have left expensive coastal cities after the pandemic.

Should we only care about losing college graduates? 
Absolutely not. There is a tendency for people talking about the brain drain to say the state is losing its “best and brightest.” That’s demonstrably false. Many of Mississippi’s most talented and productive people did not have the interest or the opportunity to get a four-year college degree. And it is not desirable for Mississippi to only retain college grads while losing everyone else. Mississippi should create more opportunities for college graduates while also investing in career pathways that do not require a bachelor’s degree. 
There are two reasons why four-year graduates deserve special attention. First, they are the only people who are leaving the state. About 70% of Mississippians with a high school diploma or associate’s degree stay in the state, but only about half of Mississippians with bachelor’s degrees stick around. Furthermore, Mississippi attracts a new resident with a high school or community college education for every one it loses, but only two four-year graduates move in for every three who leave. To solve the problem of outmigration and population loss, we must focus on where the problem lies. 
Second, Mississippi taxpayers invest more in the education of university graduates than people who complete fewer years of schooling, and university graduates have higher average earnings when they enter the workforce. When they leave, it means that the people who received the most benefit from taxpayers, and who would contribute the most in state taxes, do not repay the investment that was made in them. Therefore, Mississippians who received less state funding and who tend to earn lower incomes are forced to shoulder more of the burden for the cost of education, infrastructure and public services.

Does the departure of out-of-state college students add to the brain drain? 
It is a common fallacy that the brain drain is inflated by out-of-state students after they graduate from college in Mississippi. Currently, almost two in five students at Mississippi’s public universities came from outside the state. That’s 31,000 potential graduates who could leave the state within a few years. 
However, they will not add to the state’s brain drain — they will reduce it. Even if the vast majority leave, the few who stay will have a positive effect on the state’s migration rate. Those who leave will have no net effect, since they were counted as newcomers when they arrived in the state. 
It is theoretically possible that out-of-state graduates could distort a single year’s migration data if the number who left after graduation was larger than the number who arrived as freshmen. That is one reason most of the data presented above goes back at least 10 years or more. It is also why we have looked at where people were born, not just where they attended college, when quantifying the net loss of four-year graduates. Then there is the fact that the number of out-of-state students has grown almost every year since 2010. Brain drain is not statistical noise. It is a persistent trend.

What is the role of foreign immigration?
Foreign-born immigrants account for a tiny share of Mississippi’s overall population, but they have helped offset more than one-third of the outmigration of U.S.-born residents from the state since 2010. In that period, Mississippi has added approximately 41,000 new residents from overseas while losing 120,000 people born in the country. The state’s immigrant population has more than doubled over that time, yet Mississippi’s international immigration rate still ranks fourth-lowest in the country.
In total, 2.5% of Mississippi’s population — about 75,000 people — were born outside the U.S., the third-lowest share in the country. To put it in perspective, the city of Memphis (population 618,000) has roughly the same number of immigrants as the entire state of Mississippi. Arkansas’s foreign-born population is more than twice as large as Mississippi’s.
About half of Mississippi’s immigrants have come from Latin America, one-third from Asia, and one-tenth from Europe. Immigrants in Mississippi are more likely to be naturalized citizens than undocumented. They are also more likely to hold a four-year degree than the U.S.-born population, and they are twice as likely to start their own business. 
However, the Trump Administration’s efforts to curtail immigration will likely reduce the number of people moving to Mississippi from other countries. That will send Mississippi’s population into faster decline and increase the importance of stopping Mississippi’s domestic brain drain.

Where are the bright spots? 
Despite Mississippi’s challenges, there are reasons for optimism. 
First, Mississippi has always been a wellspring of talent, and thanks to improvements in the state’s education system, it is being developed better than ever. In recent years, the “Mississippi Miracle” in elementary reading scores has garnered widespread attention from the press and policymakers. Less heralded, but equally important, are the strides made by the state’s institutions of higher learning. In 2020, Mississippi’s colleges and universities ranked 29th nationally in the number of bachelor’s degrees granted per capita — second-most in the South, behind only Alabama. Mississippi made the highest jump of any state in the country over the preceding decade: up 14 spots, from 43rd in 2010. This occurred despite a decline in the number of in-state students, a product of falling birth rates and high outmigration among young families. Mississippi’s universities have become magnets for out-of-state students by offering quality academic programs, vibrant campus life and affordable tuition. They have proven that people are willing to move to Mississippi, and businesses and policymakers should work hard to keep them. 
Second, Mississippi is located in the middle of the fastest-growing region in the country, and it has many of the same assets as other Southern states that are drawing people from around the country. Chief among them is affordable housing. Mississippi has the second-lowest home prices in the country, according to Zillow. As Sunbelt metropolises like Atlanta and Austin have swelled with newcomers, their housing costs have surged. The pandemic accelerated migration away from expensive urban areas toward midsized cities, suburbs, and college towns where each dollar goes farther. As long as these trends continue, many communities in Mississippi have the opportunity to become attractive destinations for newcomers and returning expats. 
A third advantage is the enduring attachment that Mississippians carry with them, even if they have lived outside the state longer than they lived in it. More than 1 million people born in Mississippi now live in other states, often within a few hours of home. If just 1% moved back each year, the state could reverse its net outmigration from the past decade. Many already entertain the prospect of moving back someday, as evidenced by the numbers who return in retirement. They could be drawn back earlier if they felt assured that they would not have to sacrifice their careers or quality of life to do so. If they see signs of progress, the desire to contribute to the state they love will be a powerful force calling them home.

Where does all of this data come from? 
The Census Bureau provides the most comprehensive data on migration and population change. The Census Bureau publishes annual state and local population estimates, covering the 12 months from July 1 to June 30 each year. The most recent estimates are from 2024 (July 1, 2023-June 30, 2024). The state population changes include annual estimates of births, deaths, domestic migration, and international migration.
The Census Bureau’s American Community Survey (ACS) collects data each year on a variety of social and economic characteristics from a representative sample of Americans. The ACS data provides detailed demographic information about people who have moved into and out of Mississippi. 
The Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), housed at the University of Minnesota, allows for customized analysis of Census data to look at, for example, the age and education level of Mississippi natives who now live in another state. The University of Wisconsin’s Applied Population Laboratory also provides detailed county-level demographic breakouts of net migration patterns from 1950 to 2020.
The IRS releases statistics on tax filers who have moved between states each year. The tax data includes the age range and income earned in the year of the move. It does not rely on modeling, thus it is more precise than Census estimates (in fact, the Census estimates are partially based on IRS data), but it excludes people who did not file a tax return. 
On the state level, Mississippi’s Longitudinal Data System connects administrative data from the state’s public K-12 schools, community colleges, and universities with employment data from the Mississippi Department of Economic Security. It does not track people who leave the state, but it does record the share of graduates who are employed in Mississippi. 
There are other experimental sources that provide specialized data. For example, recent migration studies have cited LinkedIn profiles, U.S. Postal Service change-of-address requests, and credit reports. Moving companies and real estate firms also periodically publish data on customers that have made interstate moves. Analytics firms like Placer.AI sell proprietary tools that estimate migration using large consumer datasets, for example cell phone locations.

What can we do to stop the brain drain?
The available data give us a good indication of how many people are leaving, who they are, and where they are going. They do not, however, tell us why, or what we can do about it. To answer that question, we need your help.
Mississippi Today, the University of Mississippi’s Center for Population Studies, and Working Together Mississippi’s Rethink Mississippi initiative have partnered to create a survey to identify the most important things people look for when they choose where to live — whether that’s in Mississippi or somewhere else. The survey is open to anyone over 18, no matter where you’re from or where you live now. Once we know the factors that people consider when leaving or staying, we can develop strategies to help Mississippi compete with other places. If you have good ideas, the survey also gives you the opportunity to share them.
Once we have received enough responses, we will publish the results of the survey. They will inform Mississippi Today’s ongoing reporting on the causes, consequences and solutions to Mississippi’s brain drain crisis.

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — Construction is expected to wrap up on a busy stretch of Interstate 35 by the end of July.
Lisa Shearer-Salim, an Oklahoma Turnpike Authority spokesperson, said the left lane of I-35 is expected to remain closed until the end of the month near the Kilpatrick Turnpike on-ramp that allows motorists to merge onto the northbound interstate lanes.
Shearer-Salim said the closure is part of the agency’s planned improvements to the eastbound John Kilpatrick Turnpike exit to I-35, which will add a 10-foot shoulder to the ramp and a 12-foot acceleration lane to help improve merging.
Construction at the intersection is part of a $14.7 million project to widen the section of the turnpike between Eastern Avenue and I-35 to six lanes.  
The construction projects are part of ACCESS Oklahoma, a $8.2 billion long-range plan that aims to improve turnpike systems across the state. This plan includes creating interchange access points, widening turnpikes, improving bridges and adding new turnpikes to alleviate congestion.
Shearer-Salim said exit ramp construction was expected to be completed in the middle of August, but the project is “progressing a little bit faster than anticipated,” so the lane closures on I-35 are expected to end by the end of July.

(Photo courtesy of Louisiana National Guard)Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry announced Monday he will name the state’s largest National Guard training site after a little-known early 19th century militiaman and slaveowner, the father of the Confederate general whose name the facility originally carried.
The Louisiana National Guard Training Facility in Pineville will once again be known as Camp Beauregard, which had been its name until 2023 when the state joined a nationwide effort to remove monuments and honorifics to Confederate veterans and leaders.
The site was previously named after Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, who initiated the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter off South Carolina’s coast to begin the Civil War on April 12, 1861.
It will now be named after Capt. Jacques Toutant Beauregard, a member of the Louisiana Militia who reportedly fought in the 1815 Battle of New Orleans. Jacques Toutant Beauregard is P.G.T. Beauregard’s father, Louisiana National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Noel Collins confirmed to the Illuminator. 
Landry announced the renaming of the facility with a social media post that included a seemingly AI-generated image of a headstone that reads “Wokeism.”
“By restoring the name Camp Beauregard, we honor a legacy of courage and service that dates back over two centuries,” Landry said in a news release. “Let this also be a lesson that we should always give reverence to history and not be quick to so easily condemn or erase the dead, lest we and our times be judged arbitrary by future generations.”
The governor’s news release does not mention the Beauregards are related to each other.
P.G.T. Beauregard, a native of St. Bernard Parish, was the first Confederate to receive the rank of general after Louisiana seceded from the United States on Jan. 26, 1861 — one month after South Carolina became the first state to secede. He soon took command of Confederate forces in Charleston. The Union surrendered Fort Sumter to him to conclude a bloodless battle that marked the beginning of a four-year war.
Beauregard would later take advantage of the mass pardons for treason offered to former Confederate officers and officials by President Andrew Johnson. The former general was reportedly reluctant to swear an oath of allegiance to the United States but was persuaded to do so by Johnson and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.
After his return to Louisiana, P.G.T. Beauregard became a railroad superintendent and argued for Black voting rights in order to remove the radical Republicans who had gained control of state and local government during the Reconstruction period.
According to a Louisiana National Guard news release, Jacques Toutant Beauregard was a member of the Louisiana Militia whose regiment took part in a fight that was a prelude to the Battle of New Orleans.
Jacques Toutant Beauregard was the owner of a sugarcane farm in St. Bernard Parish later named the Contreras Plantation, where P.G.T. Beauregard was born. The Beauregard family owned slaves on the plantation, according to T. Harry Williams’ biography “P.G.T. Beauregard, Napoleon in Gray.”
In the news release, Maj. Gen. Thomas Friloux, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, praised Jacques Toutant Beauregard as an American hero.
“We’re naming our premier training installation after an American hero and patriot who fought for the freedom of the city of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the United States of America against a foreign invader,” Friloux said.

Across most of the South and Midwest, state laws bar local governments from requiring employers to provide paid sick leave. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)Across most of the South and Midwest, state laws bar local governments from requiring employers to provide paid sick leave, effectively stripping cities of the power to enact their own labor protections.
Nearly 73 million workers live in the 18 states, including Oklahoma, that now have such preemptive laws, according to a new report from A Better Balance, a legal advocacy organization focused on workplace rights, and the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.
“Local leaders know what’s best for their communities. To take away the decision-making power from local communities on this issue and others is very, very concerning,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director of the Southern office at A Better Balance, and one of the report’s authors.
Among the 18 states included in the report was Missouri. The legislature passed a measure in May to repeal paid leave requirements voters had approved in November that expanded access to paid sick leave for about 728,000 workers who lacked it. Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe on Thursday signed the statewide repeal into law. Local paid sick leave laws have been banned in Missouri since 2017.
Kehoe in a statement called the paid sick leave mandates “onerous,” saying they dictated when and how sick leave was provided and had “burdensome” recordkeeping and compliance obligations.
Nationwide, about 27 million workers don’t earn paid sick days, the report found. Many of them work low-wage and part-time jobs, and they’re disproportionately likely to be women, younger workers and people of color, according to the report.
“Folks are facing impossible choices between their own health — or the health of their children — and continuing to earn a paycheck to pay bills and put food on the table,” Freeland told Stateline.
In the absence of federal laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers, more cities and local governments have passed their own, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Seattle.
But lawmakers in 18 states, mainly in the South and Midwest, have done the opposite, the report found. GOP legislators have said such paid leave requirements create financial hardship for employers, particularly for smaller businesses.
Over the past decade, in GOP-led states across the country, Republican lawmakers have tried to limit the policymaking power of Democratic-led urban centers on issues ranging from immigration to voting rights to LGBTQ+ matters.
While all of the states that preempt local paid sick leave laws are Republican-led, many conservative-led states in the Mountain West don’t have such laws.
Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership and another author of the report, said that’s because Western states tend to have more of a libertarian bent. And she said preemption laws in the South have their roots in historically racist standards that undervalue Black workers.
More than half the Black labor force — 56% — lives in one of the 18 states that prohibit local paid sick time protections, the report said.
Freeland also pointed out that the paid sick leave issue impacts not just urban centers, but rural communities as well. Many people without paid sick leave work in physically demanding jobs such as manufacturing and farming.
The report’s authors say that paid sick leave laws can help reduce the spread of illness, increase employment and wages, particularly for women with child care responsibilities, and can help recruit and retain workers.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-15 14:51:21+00:00,CT Mirror,CT leaders raise doubts over future FEMA responses after Texas floods,Chris Polansky | Connecticut Public,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/15/ct-leaders-raise-doubts-over-future-fema-responses-after-texas-floods/,Connecticut leaders raise doubts over future FEMA (Federal Emergency Management Agency) responses following the Texas floods.,"Appearing on MSNBC’s “PoliticsNation” on Sunday, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont was blunt: “I just don’t know if I can count on [the Federal Emergency Management Agency] right now.”
Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) echoed that sentiment Monday at a Hartford press conference.
“They’re hollowing [FEMA] out,” Blumenthal said of the Trump administration. “They’re destroying it.”
Blumenthal is calling for an investigation into FEMA’s response to this month’s deadly flooding in Texas, which he says was “inadequate.” He wants the investigation to also cover what dramatic drops in staffing and other cuts will mean for the agency’s ability to respond to future disasters around the country.
“It’s not reform, it’s demolition that we’re seeing. That will impact Connecticut, because response times will be much slower, funds will be lacking, support simply will be absent,” Blumenthal said. “The faults and failings that we’ve seen, apparently, in Texas will be magnified here in Connecticut as the ramifications of these cuts and delays are seen in even bigger magnitude.”
FEMA’s impact on CT communities
Blumenthal praised last year’s FEMA response to major flooding in Connecticut as an example of what the agency can and should do after an emergency.
“FEMA was on the site literally within hours or days, and helped immeasurably,” Blumenthal said. “Those communities are back on their feet. Businesses are back in business because FEMA was there.”
[RELATED from 2024: For CT residents, businesses, help after August floods is available]
Moving forward, he said, “I think we ought to be deeply concerned that we may see lapses here in Connecticut.”
Blumenthal also criticized FEMA’s cancellation of the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities, or BRIC, grant program, which he said has stripped $50 million from Connecticut projects.
“This kind of cancellation is cruel and it’s dumb,” Blumenthal said. “It is literally counterproductive and more costly to cancel grants for resilience and prevention of damage due to weather disasters, because ultimately the cost will be higher in having to repair.”
Blumenthal was joined at the press conference by Meriden Mayor Kevin Scarpati, whose city has been impacted by the grant cancellation, with funding stripped in the middle of an $11.1 million project meant to reduce flooding risk along Harbor Brook.
“If these funds aren’t here for us to utilize, it’s going to be on the backs of our taxpayers who are already strained coming into this budget cycle to finish this project,” Scarpati said. “Let alone the two or three other projects we’ve got lined up in tandem to make the downtown area of the city of Meriden safer, more resilient, and get dozens of properties out of the 100-year flood plain.”

Logan Manhart, R-Aberdeen, speaks in the South Dakota House of Representatives on Feb. 21, 2025, at the state Capitol in Pierre. (John Hult/South Dakota Searchlight)Usually South Dakota has its political controversies during the legislative session or an election campaign. This year, in the dead of summer, we have a state representative’s use of the term “White Boy Summer.”
It was used in an Instagram post by Rep. Logan Manhart, a District 1 Republican from Aberdeen: “It’s White Boy Summer and the boys are back in charge.” He wrote that, along with “#MAGA.” 
I don’t use Instagram or hashtags. It seems to me that Instagram and some other social media sites are places online where people post things that they later come to regret. Manhart has since removed the Instagram post. 
My ignorance of Instagram and hashtags aside, there are some things that I do know. In this day and age, I know that using the phrase “White Boy” is just asking for trouble. It’s particularly troublesome if it’s a phrase used by a state representative. It’s even more troublesome if it’s used by a representative whose district includes the Lake Traverse Indian Reservation. 
Republican South Dakota lawmaker removes ‘white boy summer’ social media post after criticism

I’ve come to learn that the phrase is part of a rap song by Chet Hanks. (Tom Hanks’ son is a rapper?) It was written as a parody of a song called “Hot Girl Summer” by rapper Megan Thee Stallion. (I need to get out more.)
Apparently the song by Hanks has been appropriated by various racist extremist groups. (Those groups have theme songs now?)
The song’s popularity with extremist groups was enough to get Democratic members of the House involved. It’s easy to get them incensed as there are so few of them. Five members signed a letter to House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach and House Speaker Jon Hansen asking them to “address this with the seriousness it demands.”
In their letter they said Manhart’s post was racist, sexist and insulting to Native Americans. Democrats noted that the state’s Native American land was “taken through broken treaties, displacement, and violence.”
Odenbach, a Republican, said he wouldn’t punish Manhart, and he rejected the “insinuation that South Dakota is a state founded by racist oppressors, or that the great citizens of today are the cause” of continued harm to Native Americans. 
To a certain extent, Odenbach is right. Today’s South Dakotans didn’t break any treaties, they didn’t lead any raiding parties, they didn’t push Native Americans on to reservations. But someone did. Odenbach’s notion that our forefathers were squeaky clean in this regard is a whitewashing of South Dakota history.
There’s plenty of blame to go around for the way Native Americans are treated in this state, and it’s Odenbach and his political party that must shoulder some of that blame. The South Dakota Legislature, dominated by Republicans, pays woefully little attention to Native American issues, preferring to think of those as federal rather than state problems. This amounts to the Legislature, sworn to serve all South Dakotans, turning its back on a group because of their heritage.  
Americans have the First Amendment, so Manhart can say what he wants. It’s impossible to know what’s in his heart. Even though he has been unrepentant, he said characterizations of him as racist, sexist and antisemitic are false. 
Like all political controversies, this one will peter out after a while. When the dust settles, Manhart will still be a representative. Democrats will continue to monitor his public statements. Republicans will maintain that everything in South Dakota is fine. And Native Americans will continue to be largely ignored by the state government sworn to serve them.

(Photo by TEK IMAGE/SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY via Getty Images)Cancer is a cruel disease.
Unfortunately, too many Pennsylvanians already know this. Approximately 89,000 of our family, friends and neighbors were diagnosed with cancer last year and 27,570 of them are expected to lose their battle, according to the American Cancer Society.
The only silver lining: investments in scientific research are making earlier cancer detection and improved treatment possible and have led to a 33% reduction in America’s cancer death rate over the last three decades.
Unfortunately, the proposed federal budget for next year includes a 55% cut to the National Science Foundation (NSF) and a 44% cut to National Institutes of Health (NIH).
If these cuts are supported by Congress, our chances of developing cures for cancer, the number two cause of death in Pennsylvania, will be dramatically reduced.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
I am honored and fortunate that my job, supported by NSF and NIH funding, includes researching new ways to fight cancer. As a physicist who studies biology, my team of graduate students and I use mathematical equations and computer simulations to understand why tumors metastasize, or spread throughout the body. This research helps other scientists we work with design and interpret their experiments. Our work is critical because we know cancer deaths are caused by cells metastasizing, not from the existence of tumors.
We also investigate how tumors interact with other parts of the body, including the bacteria that live naturally within us. Ten years ago, the scientific community didn’t know that bacteria and tumors can co-exist. Now many researchers are asking how we can use bacteria to help deliver cancer drugs.
With this progress and potential, we have an opportunity to increase survival rates for cancer patients and cannot rest until cancer can be mitigated. This will be a long road – full of challenges and curve balls. However, the work to protect cancer patients must continue, and the Keystone State can play a key role.
The proposed budget cuts to science will devastate cancer research because curing cancer is going to take time, coordinated scientific research in Pennsylvania and across the country – and, most importantly, money.
Why should preventing funding cuts matter for Pennsylvanians?
Because the NIH’s National Cancer Institute is the world’s largest funder of cancer research.
In addition, NSF funding helps scientists like me and my team to focus on scientific research. And we’re not the only ones. Across Pennsylvania, NSF funding in 2023 supported hundreds of scientists across multiple scientific fields of study.
And, because their research is done here in the commonwealth, that funding is directly injected back into our local economies. These student scientists spend their salaries getting haircuts at local salons, eating at local restaurants, and buying groceries at local markets.

These investments are funding our future – many of my students go on to U.S. technology, pharmaceutical and biomedical companies where they can make future scientific breakthroughs.
If federal funding of scientific research is cut, these students and their research go away. We lose the discoveries they create and the public health and economic benefits that go along with them for decades to come.
No country is better at fighting cancer and funding the research required to do so. If we abandon our place as the global leader in the fight to end cancer, Americans will have to wait for cutting-edge cancer treatments. Funding cuts force the best researchers to leave the country or never to come at all.
Pennsylvania, with our world-class research facilities, hospital systems, and laboratories, is an important part of America’s scientific ecosystem. As lawmakers hash out the next federal budget, I hope there is recognition that without this funding, progress toward curing cancer for all Pennsylvanians will stall, and Pennsylvanians will continue to lose their lives to a disease we have the tools and knowledge to fight, if only we invest in them.

(Screencap)Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey joined 23 states and the District of Columbia Monday in filing suit against President Donald Trump’s administration over $6.8 billion in unexpectedly frozen funds for education initiatives like summer programming and adult learning.
The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. The complaint is the first legal response to a June 30 email memo sent from the U.S. Department of Education to education departments nationwide detailing the abrupt suspension of billions in federal education grants.
A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments were paused on June 30, the last day of fiscal year 2025. The maneuver’s timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha suggested during a virtual press conference Monday with the Attorneys General of California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, who co-lead the lawsuit.
“It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year…when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said.
The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. In states like Massachusetts, the grants also subsidized education for children of migrant workers.
Rhode Island would lose an estimated $29 million in federal funds. Across New England, Massachusetts would see a loss of over $100 million, and Connecticut would receive $50 million less. Vermont and Maine would lose $25 million each. New Hampshire, which would also see a $25 million loss of grant funding, is the only New England state not listed as a plaintiff in the suit.
The grants now depend on a review meant to ascertain whether “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” according to the three-sentence email from the education department sentJune 30.
The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.”
The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multi-state lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted the press conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration’s “little regard for the law.”
“In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said.
The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. A pair of court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.”
Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island’s case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state’s part-time legislature having just wrapped up its legislative session three weeks prior.
“It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state’s many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure.
But the AG said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January.
Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green previously denounced the funding freeze at a July 9 press conference. In a Monday statement, Infante-Green again decried the funding stoppage as one that “harms Rhode Island’s students, families, and teachers.” The $29 million loss of Congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said.
“Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk. RIDE is working closely with education leaders across the state, and across the country, doing everything we can to protect our students and limit disruptions to their learning.“
Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Neronha’s office. His office’s  website has tallied its salvoes against the Trump administration since March 13. Thus far, Neronha has co-led or joined 26 lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome.
“I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and I don’t obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record…we’ve seen this story before. We’ve been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we’ve had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.”

Many questions will be asked––one of which will be: why were thousands of Palestinian people allowed to die from starvation and genocide? How did the international community fail these people?
In November 2023, I wrote an opinion piece: “In Search of Moral Clarity in the Middle East,” in response to what I thought was some moral confusion. I feel the need to write again in response to the opinion piece: “Nonsense and falsity from ‘pro Palestinian’ groups,” published on June 23.
In April 1994, Rwanda remembered 30 years since the genocide there which killed more than 800,000 people. During this commemoration, Rwandan leaders called out the failure of the international community for not intervening to stop it. It seems that the same is happening now. To date, more than 55,000 people have been killed and a recent BBC report states that: “Gaza’s population of around 2.1 million Palestinians is at “critical risk” of famine and faces “extreme levels of food insecurity” as an Israeli blockade on humanitarian aid continues.” 
As I write, Israeli forces continue to kill Palestinians and all humanitarian aid from the UN and other credible humanitarian organizations has been blocked. Instead, an Israel-US created group, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation comprising American security contractors and ex-military officers is supposedly delivering aid. Media reports show much chaos, desperate people in need of aid getting shot at, some killed, including children and the violation of humanitarian principles such as humanity, neutrality, and impartiality.
Pro-Palestinian protestors are protesting against the genocide and intentional starvation of Palestinian people. This is not nonsense or false. Pro-Palestinian protestors are protesting against the unabating financial and military support by the the U.S. Government to the Israeli government for decades. This is also not nonsense or false. Being in solidarity with Palestinian children, women, and men does not equal condoning the actions by Hamas.
The Jewish people, just like the Palestinian people, have a right to exist; they also, just like the Palestinian people also have a right to a land,  but (some) Jewish people do not have the right to obliterate a population. I know that many Jewish people are also against what the Israeli government is doing and have done for decades.
The situation in Israel and Palestine is complex––too complex and lengthy for an opinion piece like this to do it justice. However, what can be said is that October 7, 2023 did not mark the beginning of this war. The beginning took place in 1917 with the Balfour Declaration when the British government which controlled Palestine at the time, gave Jewish people the right to immigrate and take land traditionally held by Palestinians. Historians have questioned the legitimacy behind Britain’s actions. Something could be said about the right of any country to claim sovereignty of another country and decide its fate.
Palestinians have been subjugated and oppressed in their own land for several decades now. Israel has maintained an apartheid system over Palestine. The word ‘apartheid’ originates from the Afrikaans meaning ‘apartness’ and was used to describe the repressive political system for the nonwhite majority that South Africa maintained from 1948 to 1994. The Black South African population experienced racial segregation, oppression and were denied basic rights and freedoms.  Similarly, Palestinians have been submitted to an apartheid state by Israel for many years.  
An apartheid state is a violation of international law and is considered a crime against humanity. The International Court of Justice has recently issued arrest warrants for  Benjamin Netanyahu, Yoav Gallant and a military commander of Hamas (who, it has been claimed was killed during an Israeli strike) with war crimes and crimes against humanity.
While I think it’s important to give visibility to those who died or are still held as hostages taken during the attack by Hamas by stating their names, if I was to attempt note the names of all the Gazans and others  who have died as a result of Israeli forces, I wouldn’t be able to do it––we know some of their names but not all of them. There are just too many to name but also because their lives are deemed un-grievable. This is a moral failing. Thousands of Palestinians also remain detained; most of them without due process.
The number of pro-Palestinian solidarity groups that have surged around the world since October 7, 2023 is testament to an increasing understanding and awareness of the situation in the occupied territories. These groups should be lauded rather than denounced for finally helping to make the plight of Palestinians visible. 
Solidarity with the Palestinian children, women, and men must not stop now.

(Photo by Nathaniel Herz/Northern Journal)Democrat Mary Peltola, who was Alaska’s sole member of the U.S. House, lost her reelection bid last year.
But her margin of defeat of less than 3 percentage points, in a state that Donald Trump won by double-digits, showed that Peltola remains a formidable candidate.
And that means “every national Democrat is salivating” at the idea that Peltola could challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan next year, said Jim Lottsfeldt, a longtime Anchorage political consultant.
“I’ve been asked by some famous ones, by some less famous ones, ‘What can you do to convince her?’” Lottsfeldt said.
But many Democrats inside Alaska see Peltola as the party’s strongest candidate for governor next year, when Republican incumbent Mike Dunleavy is barred by term limits from seeking reelection. And they’re waiting to see which race she enters.
“If she chooses to run for either U.S. House or U.S. Senate, I will absolutely run for governor,” said Tom Begich, the Democratic former state senator from Anchorage. “If she doesn’t choose to do that, but chooses to run for governor, then I’ll be supporting her.”
As for the potential candidate herself? 
She’s biding her time.
Peltola, who declined to comment, earlier this year took a job with a national law and lobbying firm, Holland & Hart, where she works with her former chief of staff, Anton McParland. 
Peltola has not made up her mind about whether to run for governor, U.S. Senate or U.S. House, said Elisa Rios, a former campaign manager for Peltola who still speaks with her regularly.
“It’s really just where she can make the greatest impact for Alaskans,” Rios said. “She is going to make that decision on her own time.”
While some operatives and prospective candidates may be impatient for Peltola to make up her mind, the filing deadline for the 2026 elections isn’t until June 1. And she can afford to wait, said Joelle Hall, president of the Alaska AFL-CIO, the state’s largest organized labor group. 
One poll earlier this year found that Peltola had higher favorability ratings than all three members of the Alaska congressional delegation, as well as Dunleavy.
“She’s Mary Peltola — she has 100% name ID, and she will raise money,” Hall said. “Is waiting, in any way, a problem for Mary? Absolutely not. She can decide on her own terms.”
Alaskans elected Peltola to the U.S. House two times, in quick succession, in special and regular elections in 2022 after the death of Republican Don Young, who held the seat for a half-century.
Peltola, a former member of the Alaska House, defeated Republican former Gov. Sarah Palin in both elections; she quickly became a star in national Democratic circles as the first Alaska Native woman elected to Congress. 
In the U.S. House, Peltola established herself with a brand of centrist politics unique to her state: supporting abortion rights, crusading against factory fishing and salmon bycatch while also endorsing large-scale mining and oil projects. 
 
Mary Peltola ran as pro-fish and anti-bycatch: Here’s what her agenda could look like in Congress

	Her term, however, was marked by the death of her husband Buzzy Peltola, who was killed when the small plane he was piloting crashed in September 2023. 
Mary Peltola ran for re-election last year but lost to Republican Nick Begich III. Begich, a nephew of Tom Begich, won by a final margin of 2.5 percentage points after two other candidates’ support was redistributed in Alaska’s count of ranked choice votes.
Peltola  has largely kept a low profile since her loss. But in recent days, she has emerged publicly. On July 1, the same day Sullivan voted in favor of President Donald Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” Peltola made her first post to social media in nearly five months.
“We can not secure Alaska’s future by increasing healthcare and energy costs for regular Alaskans, so millionaires, like many of my former colleagues in Congress, and their billionaire donors, can get even richer,” Peltola said.
Peltola also served as grand marshal at Anchorage’s Pride parade last month, sporting a rainbow scarf and flag as she told an enthusiastic crowd that it was “so good to be here with all these people who are pro-love.”

Officials with the Senate Democrats’ recruitment and campaigning arm, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, did not respond to requests for comment. 
But Jessica Taylor, who tracks U.S. Senate races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, said that if Peltola decides to challenge Sullivan, she would “put that seat into play.”
“I think Sullivan would certainly not want to run against her, because she’s won statewide before,” Taylor said.
A spokesman for Sullivan’s campaign declined to comment.
Winning a U.S. Senate race would net Peltola a six-year term — two more years than she’d get by winning a gubernatorial race. 
She has also proven to be a formidable fundraiser in federal elections, bringing in more than $12 million total for her campaign in 2023 and 2024.
But political observers say there are also reasons that a U.S. Senate campaign might be less attractive for Peltola. 
If elected, she’d have to resume a 3,300-mile commute to Washington. She’d likely face millions of dollars in attack ads from conservative groups.
A U.S. Senate campaign could also complicate her job at Holland & Hart, the law and lobbying firm.
While Peltola is barred from lobbying Congress for a year after leaving office, the firm, whose clients include oil and gas companies, mining businesses and pharmaceutical giant Bayer, does have contact with members of Congress. 
That includes Sullivan, who Peltola would be running against. McParland, Peltola’s former chief of staff, has visited Sullivan’s office in his new role at the law firm, according to a person with knowledge of the visit.
In a bid for governor, meanwhile, Peltola would not have to face an incumbent. Of the multiple Republicans who have announced campaigns so far, only Lt. Gov. Nancy Dahlstrom has held statewide office.
“When she enters, it’s going to be Snow White versus the seven dwarfs,” said Lottsfeldt, the consultant. “The governor’s race is just wide open for her.”
Lottsfeldt, citing the state’s economic woes, said he wants Peltola to run for governor — even though he often earns substantial sums as a local consultant for national Democratic groups when high-profile candidates like her run for congressional races.
“It would be a crazy amount of money. And, you know, I suspect I would do very well — you can quote me,” he said. “But I live in Alaska. The state is failing. The need for a governor is our highest priority right now. And so we have to focus on that.”

CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas joins reporter Jennifer Smith to trace the last decade in state takeovers of local school districts. The results, as Jonas has reported, are a far cry from a silver bullet to fix struggling schools.

AFTER 10 YEARS of state oversight, Holyoke schools are in the process of exiting state receivership. One of three districts placed into state receivership under a 2010 law, with officials at the time citing a long stretch of poor student performance and struggling leadership, Holyoke is the first to be returned to a semblance of local control. 
This week on The Codcast, CommonWealth Beacon executive editor Michael Jonas joins reporter Jennifer Smith to trace the last decade and change in state takeovers of local school districts. Touted for years as a way to wrestle underperforming districts onto a path to improvement, receivership’s results, as Jonas has reported, are a far cry from a silver-bullet fix. 
“This is sort of a super-powered authority of the state coming into a local school district and usurping the power of local officials to run the schools,” Jonas explained. “Now, that can be a bad thing from a local official’s view, or, in the state’s view, a sort of last-ditch necessary move for schools that have been struggling for some time.” 
Receivership powers were part of an education reform package passed in 2010, and they have become one of the major flashpoints in debates over the effectiveness of ed reform policies.  
Defenders of the receivership law continued to argue in recent years that the option of state control was a powerful accountability tool. Opponents of the receivership option, teachers unions most prominently, contend that not only has research found receivership to be dubiously connected to improvement but that it can also be a tool for weakening unions. 
Researcher Beth Schueler, examining state takeovers broadly and Massachusetts takeovers specifically over the past few years, found no clear evidence that such takeovers improve academic outcomes. But there is some evidence, she found, that the subset of takeovers that involve a role for local decision makers, including the ongoing state control of the schools in Lawrence, may produce better results.  
Local officials themselves are mixed on the decision to place schools into receivership, even as they cheer Holyoke’s exit, Jonas reports. Long-time boosters of education reform are also increasingly pointing to the broader set of social determinants that play a crucial role in educational outcomes, like secure housing and health care access. 
Paul Reville, who authored the 2010 reform law as state education secretary under Gov. Deval Patrick, “is still defending it, but is quick to say any idea that this alone would be the key to getting Holyoke students fully on track or students performing on levels like those in more affluent districts is just not the case,” Jonas noted. 
Jonas and Smith discuss the case for Holyoke receivership in 2015 (5:00), the mixed bag of results when states take over school districts (12:15), and the fights to come (25:30).

Tribal leaders had already denounced the detention center, but the motion to intervene in the suit against federal, state, and local officials, which environmental groups filed, adds to the legal opposition to the facility.
All of the tribe’s active ceremonial sites and 15 villages are located within the Big Cypress National Preserve, which surrounds the detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport. The tribe wants to protect its members’ homes and ability to conduct ceremonies, hunt, and fish, the filing in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida states.

“The construction and operation of a detention facility without necessary environmental studies potentially poses a substantial threat to the rights and interests of the Tribe and the livelihood of Tribal members who live adjacent thereto,” wrote the attorneys representing the Miccosukee Tribe.
“Additionally, the unknown environmental impacts of the detention facility’s construction and operation may affect the number and quality of game and/or fish stocks such that Tribe’s traditional rights — guaranteed by federal and state law — are rendered meaningless.”
Two environmental groups, Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biological Diversity, brought the suit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Florida Division of Emergency Management, and Miami-Dade County on June 27. They allege construction of the detention center violates a federal law that requires environmental analysis of potential harms and that the public did not get an opportunity to comment.
So far, U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez hasn’t taken action on the temporary restraining order the environmental groups seek. They filed another motion asking the judge to rule by Friday after he didn’t order construction to stop before immigrants awaiting deportation arrived at the detention center on July 2.

Gov. Ron DeSantis has dismissed the concerns environmental groups are raising as illegitimate, saying they just want to stop deportations. At the same time, the federal government is skirting responsibility for the detention center in its attempt to ward off the lawsuit.
DHS neither funded nor authorized the tent and trailer detention center, counsel for the department wrote in a filing opposing environmental groups’ request that the court halt the site.
A result other than stopping the construction and operation of the detention center would be unacceptable to the tribe.
The filing in federal court also details how the detention center, which Florida Republicans are calling “Alligator Alcatraz” and raising campaign cash by hawking related merchandise, is disrupting nearby villages. One of the villages, the Panther-Osceola Camp, is approximately 1,000 feet from the boundary of the detention center.
“At present, residents report that ingress and egress to their village have been impacted by increased traffic flow along US-41. Further, given the village’s proximity to the facility, residents are concerned about impacts to their freedom to hunt and fish in the immediate area adjacent to a securitized federal detention and immigration facility, as well as the possibility of a facility escape posing a security risk for their community,” the filing to the court states.

One of the primary drinking water sources for the region, the river has high nitrate levels that have led to water restrictions for some 600,000 customers. (Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Cities, states say they’ll need more help to replace millions of lead pipes

Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
 The role of agriculture

As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.


Central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels.


Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
‘Time for a reckoning.’ Kansas farmers brace for water cuts to save Ogallala Aquifer

In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
 Citizen action

The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walton League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.










I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Northeast Iowa retired science teacher Birgitta Meade


While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
 Small towns struggle

Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images; logo courtesy the State of Iowa)A Minnesota funeral home operator has been fined $1,000 for doing business in Iowa without a license for 12 years.
According to the Iowa Board of Mortuary Science, Daniel Dingmann, who operates a funeral home in southern Minnesota, became an Iowa-licensed funeral director in 1998.
From 1998 to 2012, Dingmann completed the yearly renewal of his Iowa license via regular mail. According to state records, the license became inactive after 2012 — possibly because Dingmann stopped receiving license-renewal notices as the board transitioned to an electronic application process.
In late 2023, Dingmann realized his Iowa license was inactive and inquired with the board as to the renewal process. The board staff instructed him to go online and set up an account, which he attempted to do but without success because of technical issues. Even with assistance from the board staff, Dingmann was unable to successfully establish an online account in order to renew his license.
As a result, he eventually submitted a paper copy of a renewal form along with a check to pay for a new license. The board then notified Dingmann it would be imposing a $1,000 civil penalty against him for handling Iowa funeral services without a license. Dingmann objected, noting that it was he who brought the issue to the board’s attention that he had subsequently tried to reactivate his license with no success.
In May 2025, after the dispute had already gone to a hearing before an administrative law judge, the board moved to drop prosecution of the matter in favor of a dismissal that would still involve a $1,000 civil penalty.  Administrative Law Judge Laura Lockard rejected the deal, noting that it amounted to a settlement agreement rather than a dismissal and that only the board itself, rather than an administrative law judge, could legally approve such an agreement.
As a result, the board’s motion to dismiss the case was denied, and Lockard approved the $1,000 civil penalty. In doing so, she noted that there had been no complaints regarding Dingmann’s work in Iowa, nor any evidence of any harm to the public, or any evidence of action taken against his license in other states. Taking into account “the economic benefit gained” by Dingmann as a result of practicing without a license, Lockard concluded a $1,000 civil penalty was appropriate.
In her June 10, 2025, decision, Lockard noted that Dingmann could continue his attempts to renew his license, a process that had yet to be completed at the time of his hearing in April.

When thimble-sized mussels were first detected last year in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, biologists quickly rang the alarm over how severely this invasive species could threaten the state’s water supply systems. 
Now, nine months after the mollusks’ appearance near Stockton, officials are in a race to rein in golden mussels as their larvae spread through the state’s network of pumps, pipes and canals, reports CalMatters’ Rachel Becker.
Native to China and Southeast Asia, these freshwater mussels can attach themselves to underwater surfaces and form “reefs” that can grow as fast as 150 miles a year. The mollusks have already infiltrated California’s two major water systems that send Delta water south to 30 million people and millions of acres of farmland.
To curb their spread, some water managers are requiring inspections that include quarantining and decontaminating boats before they can enter certain lakes and reservoirs. California’s fish and wildlife agency also has a handful of dogs trained to detect the mollusk.
But the wildlife department is understaffed, and the recently passed state budget includes no funding to combat the mussels. Oversight is also patchy, leaving many lakes with no protection. The federally-managed Shasta Lake, for example, is the biggest reservoir in the state and frequented by boaters — but it does not have a mandatory inspection program.

In other environmental news: To save an estimated $499 billion within the next decade, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping budget bill earlier this month that included changes to federal tax incentives that could dampen California’s clean-energy ambitions.
As CalMatters’ Alejandro Lazo explains, developers of wind and solar projects now face a shorter deadline for securing tax credits, and companies that rely on China for machine parts are barred from accessing the credits. In the face of these new rules, nearly a dozen solar projects across California could be delayed or canceled.

CalPERS recovers from Trump tariffs — for now

At a board meeting Monday, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System reported that it has exceeded its investment targets and has rebounded from the economic hit it took from the pandemic, writes CalMatters’ Adam Ashton.
CalPERS is the nation’s largest public pension fund, and finances the retirement plans of about 2 million people. As of Monday evening, it is worth about $556 billion. CalPERS set out to gain 6.8% on its investments this past financial year, and instead reported that it made 11.6%.
The gains come after a dramatic loss in its portfolio in April, when Trump’s inconsistent rollout of new tariff policies caused a $6.6 trillion stock market wipeout. By May the pension fund recovered from its April low of $508 million, but it still remains underfunded since it’s worth less than what it owes over time to government workers and retirees.
During the meeting, CalPERS leaders also received a number of comments from the public urging the fund to divest from the electric car company Tesla. Though calls to divest from Tesla aren’t new, the involvement of its CEO, Elon Musk, in Trump’s administration — such as his time leading the White House’s Department of Government Efficiency — has sparked renewed pressure to divest.

CA sues Trump over frozen school funds

Joining a coalition of 23 other states, California is suing the Trump administration over its withholding of $6.8 billion dollars in educational funding weeks before the start of the new school year.
Citing that nearly $940 million of federal funding has been frozen for California, Attorney General Rob Bonta unveiled the lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Education on Monday. He and three other state attorneys general at a news conference argued that withholding the money undermines Congress’ authority over the budget. 

Bonta: “Our states are owed the billions in federal funding that Trump and (U.S. Secretary Linda) McMahon have frozen, and we’re going to court to see that it’s reinstated.”

Congress had already set aside the money for schools in March, which schools took in consideration for their own budgets. But rather than the federal education department releasing the funds on July 1 as expected, the department instead notified schools that it was reviewing the money. Among other services, the money goes toward teacher professional development and after school programs.
Monday’s announcement marks the 31st lawsuit the state has filed against the current Trump administration. In another lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday that the Trump administration can fire federal workers at the education department, clearing a path to dismantle the agency completely.

Officials are shoring up water systems infiltrated by the golden mussel. Dogs and human inspectors are checking boats at some lakes, but a patchwork of oversight leaves many lakes unprotected. “There’s just too many boats and too many people out there,” one warden said.



One of the state’s best investigators was on the hunt for golden mussels — a dangerous new invader in California’s waters, with a reputation for destruction. 
Wearing a collar and a tongue-lolling grin, Allee, a Belgian Malinois, sniffed along the glittering hull of a bass boat at an inspection station in Butte County. 
The dog’s handler, California Department of Fish and Wildlife Warden Mark Rose, pointed at the outboard motor and the dog delicately nosed the propellers. She stretched up on her hind legs to get a good whiff of the port side before Rose led her away. She yawned. Nothing here.
The dog was searching for any hint of the thimble-sized mussels hidden in the nooks and crannies of boats headed to Lake Oroville, the state’s second-largest reservoir, or two smaller reservoirs nearby. Her human counterparts at the Department of Water Resources’ inspection station combed the boat’s interior for standing water that could harbor larvae. 
Mandatory boat inspections are among the few weapons in California’s arsenal for protecting its thousands of lakes and reservoirs from the invasion. The mussels’ prolific growth and voracious appetites can upend entire ecosystems, encrust underwater surfaces, choke off water supplies and damage dams and power plants. 
“We have been on high alert,” said Tanya Veldhuizen, special projects section manager in  the California Department of Water Resources’ environmental assessment branch, which operates the state’s water delivery system. “It’s not just on our doorstep, it’s in our house.”

State water managers made the alarming discovery last October that golden mussels, which are native to China and Southeast Asia, had invaded the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta —  the core of California’s massive water delivery systems.  It marked the first detection in North America.

The mussels, first discovered encrusting a float near the Port of Stockton, have already infiltrated California’s two major state and federal water systems, which export water from the Delta to supply 30 million people and millions of acres of farmland. Their larvae are spreading through the network of pumps, pipes and canals.
“To everyone’s horror, it was in many, many more places than we expected,” said Ted Grosholz, a professor emeritus with the UC Davis Coastal and Marine Sciences Institute. “The further they looked, the further they found them.”
Now the mussels are here to stay. They cannot be eradicated. Water suppliers bracing for the onslaught have instead turned their efforts to shoring up pipes, pumps and treatment plants against the infestation. 

The state’s most immediate priority is protecting the small pipes at upstream pumping facilities that keep water deliveries flowing, then they’ll move their efforts downstream, Veldhuizen said.
“It is a huge undertaking,” Veldhuizen said. “We’re not looking at removing mussels from all the water, because it’s just not feasible.”
The race is on to keep the mussels and their microscopic larvae from infesting untainted lakes by stowing away on hulls or inside damp, internal cavities of boats.
But resources are stretched precariously thin. There is no funding dedicated to fighting invasive golden mussels in the state’s budget. And each new infestation means one more place from which they can spread. 
Boaters statewide are warned to “clean, drain and dry” anything that touches water before moving it to another lake or river. Microscopic larvae can survive in tiny amounts of trapped water. Adult mussels may survive for around a week or longer with no water at all. 
Water managers in some lakes and reservoirs now require inspections, quarantine periods and decontamination with hot water before boats can enter. Others have closed or limited access to boating. But a patchwork of oversight leaves many lakes with no protection at all. 
‘Oh, look what we found’ — the hunt for mussels
Allee, with her sensitive snout and devotion to Rose, is one of the state’s more finely-honed weapons against this invasion. But she is one of only 14 dogs with the wildlife agency trained to detect invasive mussels, Rose said.  And she is also tasked with sniffing out the guns, ammunition and kills of wildlife poachers farther north in Tehama County, where Rose is the only game warden for nearly 3,000 square miles.

A state and federal mussels task force released recommendations in April, including mandatory decontamination of boats in infested areas for longer than five days and prevention programs at all accessible, uninfested waters.  But these are monumental tasks, especially amid federal staff cuts and the state’s $12 billion budget deficit. California’s fish and wildlife agency, for instance, is severely understaffed, with only 33% of the resources needed to fulfill its law enforcement duties and 26% needed for habitat and species conservation, according to a 2021 analysis mandated by the Legislature.Even so, Gov. Gavin Newsom proposed cutting 164 vacant positions at the department this year, including wardens and other enforcement positions, according to HD Palmer with the Department of Finance.  Lawmakers rejected the cuts for now, but the finance department said the budget does not provide funding to fight golden mussels.“Everybody’s under fire,” UC Davis’ Grosholz said. “It’s not a great time for resource agencies to suddenly have a brand new threat.” 
“They’re actually doing some good to keep the mussels out of the (Oroville) water. Don’t know what they’re doing with all the other thousands of lakes around that they’re not monitoring, though.” DEAN DYRR, BOATER AT LAKE OROVILLE
At the Department of Water Resources’ Oroville inspection station last month, trucks hauling expensive fishing boats and beat-up skiffs rolled over the dusty parking lot at the Thermalito Forebay, a smaller, downstream reservoir.  The boats that passed Allee’s smell test and neon-vested inspectors were recorded and tagged, then sent to the open ramps. Boats that failed because they were still wet — even wet cupholders and life jackets can trigger a failure — were sent to a decontamination station, where they were sprayed and flushed with steaming water. Inspection stations set up by multiple agencies have already intercepted boats contaminated with golden mussels bound for lakes Tahoe, Folsom, Berryessa and Oroville. Leaning against his sailboat at an Oroville boat ramp, boater Dean Dyrr said inspectors spotted mussels on the boat right next to his when his sailboat was checked at the Thermalito Forebay in May.“They were like, ‘Oh, look what we found!’ and it was a handful of mussels,” Dyrr said as his wife loaded up their boat with supplies and water. Lake Oroville glinted against the dry, oak-studded foothills, and dozens of boats bobbed on its surface. 
When mussels are found, the boat is pressure-washed and flushed with hot water, then confirmed free of mussels before it can be launched at the lake.
“The program’s actually working. They’re actually doing some good to keep the mussels out of the water” at Oroville, Dyrr said. “Don’t know what they’re doing with all the other thousands of lakes around that they’re not monitoring, though.”

Various authorities — federal, state, local and private — manage access to California’s lakes and reservoirs. Of particular concern are the lakes and waterways that are not fed by Delta water, because they have the best chance of being spared infestations.Around thirty lakes and reservoirs have inspection programs and quarantine requirements of up to 60 days, and a handful have limited or barred access to boats, according to the state’s Division of Boating and Waterways’ analysis of a list they maintain. The division warns, however, that the list is not comprehensive and is kept as a courtesy with the limited staff that they have; boaters are advised to contact lakes and reservoirs to confirm. Among the biggest gaps in oversight are federally-managed Whiskeytown and Shasta lakes.  Shasta Lake is the biggest reservoir in the state, and both are popular with boaters. Neither have mandatory inspection programs. “If golden mussels are detected in Shasta Lake, we will reassess the current approach and consider additional measures,” a spokesperson with the U.S. Forest Service said in an email. The agency asks boaters to voluntarily dry their boats for five days between visits to local North State lakes like Shasta and Whiskeytown, and 30 days if entering the lakes from outside the area. Laura Shaskey, division lead of resource management and interpretation with the Whiskeytown National Recreation Area, said voluntary inspections are offered during peak visiting periods. The inspection programs that do exist are costly and labor intensive. Lake Tahoe’s has been in place since 2008, after invasive quagga mussels breached California’s borders. But golden mussels are more ecologically nimble than previous invaders, and can survive in a much bigger range of waters. So the threat that they pose to Lake Tahoe is even greater, said Jeff Cowen, a spokesperson for the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. 
“There’s just too many boats and too many people out there to not miss them. It’s physically impossible.”MARK ROSE, STATE FISH AND WILDLIFE WARDEN
The agency has budgeted $1.1 million this fiscal year for its mandatory inspection program, which now also requires decontamination for boats entering on trailers. Boaters launching for the first time in Tahoe will need to pay a $115 registration fee for the year, plus $30 to $60 decontamination fees each time the boat returns from another lake. Kayaks, paddleboards and other hand-launched boats can skip the line and be decontaminated for free.  At Folsom Lake and Lake Clementine, the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation and California State Parks require boaters to quarantine their boats for 30 days after inspection before they can enter the water, or pay a company for decontamination. By mid-June, staff braving sometimes sweltering weather had inspected more than 7,000 boats in just two months. But for all the expense and effort, there are still too many ways for boats to leave the Delta with invasive stowaways, and too few resources to stop them. There are also traces of DNA that suggest golden mussels had already invaded the Delta more than a year before they were first spotted near the Port of Stockton, Veldhuizen said. “There is the real potential that watercraft have moved golden mussels out of the Delta, and my fear is that we will begin to see detections outside of that interconnected water,” Martha Volkoff, environmental program manager for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife’s Invasive Species Program, said at a recent webinar. Still, Volkoff told CalMatters, it is worth trying to slow the spread as much as possible. California has done it before: Quagga mussels are thought to have spread to only two unconnected bodies of water since they were first discovered in Southern California’s Colorado River Aqueduct in 2007. “There’s so much to protect yet,” Volkoff said. “Yes, it’s a lot of work, but the long-term savings — to the environment and to all the other ways that it costs us — is investment well spent, even if we just delay new introductions.” Rose, in his K-9 unit vest, led Allee toward a pickup hauling an aluminum fishing boat when the driver rattled away, kicking up dust. The boat had not been inspected; the lake he was heading to — Collins Lake, in Yuba County — doesn’t require them. “There’s just too many boats and too many people out there to not miss them. It’s physically impossible,” Rose said. Another boat pulled up, and Allee happily trotted over.
Boaters upset about long dry-outs 
About 25 miles away in the Sierra foothills, Collins Lake brimmed with campers on a Friday afternoon in June. People lounged on the sandy beach and paddled on kayaks and floats. A handful of fishing boats bobbed in the deeper water. 
A sign at the lake’s boat ramp warned “DON’T MOVE A MUSSEL. CLEAN. DRAIN. DRY.” It was a precaution against the older threats of quagga and zebra mussels, and hadn’t been updated yet to include the state’s newest invader.

There was no one checking boats at the ramp, though — which had drawn Mark Mezzanares and his friend Sonny Steuart to the lake. The retirees from Colfax were put off by the 30-day dry-out periods required at Folsom Lake in Sacramento County and Rollins Lake in Nevada County, though boaters who want to fast-track entry can pay for disinfection. 
“I’m not gonna go sit over there and have my boat sit in the freaking driveway for 30 days and then go fishing once,” Mezzanares said. Rollins’ quarantine is an even more stringent 60 days for boats with bilges, ballasts and live water tanks that could carry stowaways. 
“You don’t buy and spend $45,000 on a boat to go to one lake,” he said. They wished the state offered a pass that allowed boats cleared for one lake to visit others. 
It’s a common refrain among boaters who chafe at the new restrictions. Maggie Macias, a spokesperson for the Department of Water Resources, said in an email they are discussing a pass program from Lake Oroville with other lake managers, but will need to ensure that any potential partners have rigorous inspections — and don’t already have mussels in the water themselves. 
Those whose livelihoods depend on keeping lakes open for visitors are facing a difficult new reality. Jacob Young, the general manager of Collins Lake recreation area, is leaving it up to the boaters to ensure their boats are clean, drained and dry — at least for now.  
“You can just sense a lot of that frustration that they’re feeling, like, ‘This is ridiculous,’” Young said. “And the same token, you get some people who might say, ‘Man, you’re not doing any golden mussel inspections? How could you not be doing that and making sure you’re staying safe?’” 
At the boat ramp, water poured from the motor of a cherry-red bass boat that visitor Dan Jacobs had just hauled off the lake. Jacobs said he wished California had a network of courtesy decontamination stations like the ones offered in Minnesota to combat the spread of invasive zebra mussels, instead of lengthy quarantines. 
“One of the rare times our tax dollars were spent wisely,” he said. 
For him, the risk to Collins Lake feels personal; he and his wife camped there decades ago, when he was stationed at Beale Air Force Base, and now their children and grandchildren return for family camping trips. 
“As bad as the mussels are, it makes you kind of nervous,” he said. “All it takes is one person to screw it up for everyone.”

Why that’s bad news for California medical students,Mikhail Zinshteyn and Kristen Hwang,,,,,https://calmatters.org/health/2025/07/student-loan-foregiveness-trump-bill/,"Doctors regularly need to pay more than $300,000 for medical school, including tuition and housing. New regulations signed by President Donald Trump caps their federal borrowing at $200,000 for medical degrees.","In summary
Doctors regularly need to pay more than $300,000 for medical school, including tuition and housing. New regulations signed by President Donald Trump caps their federal borrowing at $200,000 for medical degrees.


Becoming a doctor will likely become even more difficult under the new tax bill Congress approved after lawmakers slashed the amount of money medical school students can borrow in federal loans.The extra burden may mean fewer students choose careers in medicine, particularly low-income students. Patients, in turn, may see fewer doctors practicing family medicine.The new rules, part of the sweeping Republican-backed “big, beautiful bill” that President Donald Trump signed into law July 4, cap federal debt for professional degree students at $50,000 annually and $257,000 for the life of a student’s college journey, including undergraduate debt. 
Previously graduate students could borrow up to the cost of their programs to afford their degrees with so-called Grad PLUS loans. Starting next year, those loans will disappear. While all graduate programs are affected by the new law, medical school lasts four years and regularly requires more than $300,000 for tuition, housing, food and other expenses for a degree.Without public loans, many students will have to borrow from private lenders, which provide far fewer protections for loan repayment and, unlike federal plans, don’t offer loan forgiveness. 
Public service loan forgiveness, which can occur after 10 years of employment in nonprofit settings, is a particular draw for medical school graduates who choose to work in government or nonprofit hospitals and care facilities that pay less but have a mission of treating the poor. 
Private lenders may also deny some students loans or charge higher interest rates based on their financial history. Private loans typically require cosigners, which not all borrowers are able to arrange. 
Martha Santana-Chin, chief executive of the insurer L.A. Care Health Plan, said the cost of college, medical school and loan repayment already presents “financial barrier after financial barrier” that prevents many from pursuing medicine. Reliance on private loans will make it even harder for low-income students in particular to become doctors, she said.“If you don’t have access to loans, if you don’t have access to preferred loan terms, it’s going to be that much more difficult for you,” Santana-Chin said.
The rules kick in for new students July 1, 2026. A student who has Grad PLUS before that date can continue to use it for their remaining program term, up to a maximum of three years.
The lower borrowing limits are a key way Congress tried to record savings in the tax bill. By capping how much graduate students can borrow, limiting how much loan debt is forgiven and increasing in many cases how much borrowers of all degrees pay monthly, taxpayers cover less of the tab. But the Republican bill includes huge tax and revenue cuts that, even with other budget savings, add more than $3 trillion to the national debt in the next decade. The higher-ed savings were about $300 billion.
”Straightforward economic logic would suggest (the new rules) are going to make it less likely for some of those students to be able to pursue graduate degrees than they are now,” said Jordan Matsudaira, a professor at American University. He was also chief economist at the U.S. Department of Education during the Biden administration.
“I don’t think we’ve ever been in a position where we’ve sent students to the private loan market looking for loans on this scale to be able to finance their education,” he added.
California medical school debt levels
U.S. Department of Education data from the Biden administration that Matsudaira shared with CalMatters show California’s largest producer of doctors, the University of California, regularly graduates students with debt in excess of $200,000, the most the new law says a graduate student in a professional program may borrow from the government.

At UC Irvine’s school of medicine, the median debt from federal loans for med students was $195,000 for the years 2019-20 to 2022-23. That means that half of the students borrowed more and likely almost all of the new students in those situations would need private loans. Twenty-five percent of students there borrowed at least $254,000 and 10% borrowed at least $284,000. 
Every UC medical school had at least 10% of graduates with debt above $200,000. For UC Riverside, it was $270,000. At UCLA and UC San Diego, 10% of graduates borrowed more than $255,000. 
Many new graduates in similar situations would need $55,000 to $70,000 or more in private debt to finance their education. 
Four of the six UC medical schools had at least 10% of students borrowing more than $73,000 in a single year; new students in similar situations would need to find at least $23,000 in financing from private loans or some other support.
At the private University of Southern California, 50% of graduates borrowed more than $260,000, and 25% borrowed in excess of $328,000, so a large chunk of new students would need to borrow at least $128,000 in private loans or find other ways of paying. A spokesperson for the school said no one was available to answer CalMatters’ questions. 

There were 1,334 students graduating with medical degrees and 361 with similar doctor of osteopathic medicine degrees in 2023, a UC San Francisco report found. The UCs accounted for nearly 800 medical degree graduates.

The University of California perspective
Calvin Yang, a rising senior at UC Berkeley, said attending medical school has been his dream since he was a child. The new caps on federal borrowing won’t deter him from becoming a doctor, but they’ll slow him down and may force him to attend cheaper schools.He plans to take at least one gap year after he graduates next spring and work to save as much as he can to avoid private loans.“It’s frustrating to see restrictions on our ability to simply want to pursue an education in order to help the world, right?” he asked. “Long COVID persists. Mental health remains a major issue, diabetes, obesity — those all require medical professionals.”He thinks some students will “reconsider the medical school pathway.” The loan caps are a concern among his friends with medical school ambitions.“We do think that the private market will meet a lot of the needs of those students,” said Shawn Brick, associate vice provost of student financial support for the UC Office of the President. “Approval rates are fairly high for medical students.”Still, “we do share the concern … about the student who may not have credit that would give them access to loans in the private market.”Brick said the UC has time to work with private lenders to work on financial products that “would be more accessible to students who maybe don’t have the best credit.”Nearly 3,000 UC med students receive an average of $32,000 in UC grants to support their education. The UC also issues its own loans, but in small numbers.The median loan size UC med students have had to borrow has declined by about $50,000 over the past four years, adjusted for inflation, UC data show. At the same time, UC grant aid for med students has grown by about 50%. 

Doctors and advocates weigh in
Even before these changes, Dr. Julián Restrepo said medical school leaves doctors with so much debt that he knows people who are paying off loans decades after graduating, surgeons who work multiple jobs and resident physicians who pick up extra shifts to make ends meet.
“It is a huge burden for us, and it very well determines where we live, where we work, how we work and how we manage our practices,” Restrepo said.
Restrepo graduated from Texas A&M University’s medical school in 2012 and did his residency at Los Angeles County Medical Center. He now works as a primary care physician at a federally qualified health center in Los Angeles and said public service loan forgiveness is an effective way to recruit high quality physicians and specialists to underserved areas. 
With interest, Restrepo’s loan of about $230,000 grew to more than $300,000. He made payments on the loan as part of the public service loan forgiveness program for about seven years until a Biden-era loan forbearance program temporarily kicked in. An L.A. Care program aimed at recruiting physicians to underserved areas will pay off the remainder of his loans, and Restrepo said he’s extremely fortunate. At many points in his career he was forced to defer his loan payments because he couldn’t afford it. 
The American Association of Medical Colleges also thinks the impending reliance on private loans may lead to fewer future doctors. “We are concerned that this added barrier could deter qualified candidates from pursuing a medical degree altogether, which could ultimately worsen the existing and expected physician workforce shortage,” said Kristen Earle, director of student financial services at the association, which oversees the medical school entrance exam. The association projects a national shortage of 86,000 physicians by 2036. California, like much of the country, has a shortage of primary care physicians, with the Central Coast, Central Valley and Southern Border regions projected to have the most severe shortages.
More pressure on medical residents
And while medical degrees eventually lead to relatively high salaries that are typically $220,000 a year to more than $400,000 depending on the specialization, early career doctors earn much less in residency, a training period of three to sometimes seven or more years. As residents, doctors work 60 to 80 hours a week for salaries of about $70,000 to $100,000, depending on the region and whether residents are unionized.Private lenders offer a wide range of interest rates for medical school, from about 3% to more than 14%. Federal rates fall in the middle of that range, are less variable and pegged to inflation. Some private lenders indicate online that they don’t require borrowers to pay while they’re in residency for a few years, while others require only a small payment. In either case, the unpaid interest grows the overall debt a borrower will have to pay off.
Earle said she hopes that private lenders keep interest rates fairly low for medical school students because they’re a good bet to pay off their debt given the higher earnings potential.
Mahima Iyengar is in her final year of residency at the massive Los Angeles General Medical Center to become a primary care physician.She said she borrowed $250,000 in federal loans to attend medical school — $50,000 above next year’s maximum — and has no idea how someone like her would have avoided private loans. She wanted to study at the public University of Maryland, a less expensive option in her home state, but wasn’t admitted. Instead she attended the University of Rochester, another highly competitive but pricier private medical school hundreds of miles from home.“I could have tried to live cheaper in med school, but I don’t think it would have been much more possible than how I was living with three, four roommates,” said the 31-year-old, who’s also a leader in her union.Like a majority of medical school students, Iyengar knew she’d use public service loan forgiveness. Now that option will be gone for professional school debt above $200,000. 
“We want a diverse group of people taking care of patients, because we know that patients have better outcomes from providers that understand where they’ve come from,” she said. But that diversity might ebb if lower-income students, who are more likely to be students of color, feel priced out of med school.UC agrees. “We don’t know for sure, but we are concerned about this slowing the efforts to build the physician workforce across the country, and especially in California, where we’ve got significant needs in primary care in rural areas,” said Heather Harper, spokesperson for UC’s medical operations.
L.A. Care has invested $255 million since 2018 in scholarships for medical students and loan repayment for physicians to try and recruit doctors, but Santana-Chin said it’s not enough money to meet the need. She hopes that medical schools see the federal changes as a “call to action” to make education more affordable, she said.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/041923_UC-Davis-Medical_BANG_CM_01.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-15 09:04:28.932277

And this time, the cause isn’t homegrown.","Guest Commentary written by

Nils Gilman
Nils Gilman is the chief operating officer and executive vice president of the Berggruen Institute.


California has finally made real progress on one of its most stubborn problems: the housing crisis. After decades of paralysis, the state has begun to unwind the bureaucratic thicket that made it almost impossible to build new homes in cities. This should be a moment for cautious optimism.
Yet a new and very different problem looms — one that threatens to undermine these hard-won reforms before a single unit is built: a growing national effort to crack down on the very workers California needs to build its future.
This summer, Gov. Gavin Newsom pushed through a pair of bills — Assembly Bill 130 and Senate Bill 131 — that amount to the most significant overhaul of California’s development rules in more than 50 years. In particular, the reforms are massively curtailing the California Environmental Quality Act, which for decades has allowed opponents to block urban housing with endless lawsuits and reviews. 
Urban infill projects near transit are now largely exempt from CEQA litigation. Developers are, for the first time in a generation, preparing to build at scale.
But just as California removes the red tape, it may find itself caught in another bind: a lack of construction workers. And this time, the cause isn’t homegrown.
More than 40% of California’s construction workforce is foreign-born, according to the National Association of Homebuilders. That includes more than half a million immigrants, many of them undocumented, who work as framers, drywallers, roofers and laborers. 
These are physically demanding jobs, often shunned by native-born workers. Without them, the math of housing development simply doesn’t work.
Yet the national political winds are blowing in the opposite direction. The Trump-aligned right has completely changed the conversation about immigration. Their focus is on deporting not just criminals, but all undocumented migrants. Mass deportation, as recently as last year considered a fringe idea, is now the openly stated policy objective. 
The implications for industries that rely heavily on immigrants are as dire as they are obvious. Heightened enforcement, even without sweeping raids, creates fear and uncertainty. Some workers leave preemptively. Others move into the shadows.
The result? Just as building permits get faster, the labor force that builds will get scarcer. Construction firms already report difficulty assembling full crews. Wages are rising. Projects are being delayed — not by paperwork, but by a shortage of hands.
If this trend continues, California risks an awkward outcome: a flood of new housing approvals but not enough workers to actually build them. The “abundance agenda” could turn into a shelf full of blueprints. 
In the worst case, we end up with a hollow boom — developments greenlit but never started, or started but never finished.
As construction lags, pressure will mount on Sacramento to push back against federal immigration policy. California has clashed with Washington before — on climate, guns, and abortion. Housing could be next. Newsom, perhaps eyeing national office, may argue that federal immigration enforcement is sabotaging state-led economic reform. 
This will be a high-stakes confrontation. The federal government controls immigration. California controls land use. The two are now on a collision course.
The deeper irony is hard to miss. For years, the consensus was that California’s housing problems were self-inflicted — caused by too much regulation and not enough political courage. Now that the state is finally addressing those issues, it’s being undermined by a different kind of politics: a national campaign against the very people who build homes.
If California wants to realize its new housing vision, it will need not just faster permits but also enough skilled workers to turn blueprints into homes. That means protecting the workforce it has — even when doing so puts it at odds with Washington.
Otherwise, we will be left with the worst of both worlds: new rules, no results and a housing crisis that continues to degrade the quality of life for far too many Californians.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/070822_Housing-Elk-Grove_RL_CM_21.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-15 09:04:28.932277

(Jacob Wackerhausen/Getty Images)NEW ORLEANS – Before Louisiana expanded Medicaid in 2016, DePaul Community Health Centers served about 20,000 patients, regardless of their ability to pay. As more Louisianians enrolled in Medicaid, the number of DePaul’s patients more than doubled, said Michael Griffin, DePaul’s president and CEO. Today, most of their 50,000 patients are covered by Medicaid.

“ Medicaid funding has helped us to take care of more people,” he said. “More people had coverage.”
Now, Louisiana could lose up to $35 billion in federal Medicaid dollars over the next decade under the sweeping cuts to the program in the latest budget reconciliation law, known as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Policy analysts with the nonprofit KFF estimate that more than 200,000 Louisiana residents could lose their insurance in the next decade as the provisions of the law unfold.
Griffin and other community health providers in New Orleans worry there won’t be enough funds to provide care when the number of uninsured patients starts to rise.
“We know that our uninsured population is going to go up, so how do we cover the cost of care for those individuals?” Griffin said. “ We don’t want them going to the emergency room, which is going to cost the whole system and the state more money.”
Community health centers aim to lower emergency room visits and increase access to preventative care by reducing barriers, such as cost, distance or language. They also help patients enroll in Medicaid or plans subsidized under the Affordable Care Act.

After Louisiana expanded Medicaid eligibility, the number of uninsured people plummeted by 60% in the following four years. By 2023, more than a third of New Orleans residents were enrolled in Medicaid.
Under the new law, Medicaid recipients will eventually be required to work at least 80 hours a month and verify their eligibility twice a year. Both provisions will steeply increase the administrative burden on both patients and community health care providers. Griffin said the paperwork requirements could lead to people losing their insurance, and he said New Orleans residents are especially vulnerable because of the sizable self-employed population.
“ How do our musicians, our artists, our culture bearers, who work at their own rate and pace, prove that they’re doing work 20 hours a week?” he said. “ It’s very important that they stay healthy just like everyone else.”
The New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic, which has served artists and culture bearers for more than 20 years, is also bracing for the changes.
Peggy Honore, president of the New Orleans Musicians’ Clinic and Assistance Foundation, said even the addition of $35 copay for some services — another impending change to Medicaid — could determine whether an artist can receive care.
“ It’s going to be an increased burden on us from a fundraising perspective to make sure that musicians continue to have access to health care,” she said.
Griffin said it isn’t yet clear how to implement the law’s provisions or how much funding community health clinics will receive to help with compliance. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is expected to provide guidance within the next six months. Although Congress has allocated $475 million to help with implementation of the work and eligibility requirements as well as $50 billion toward rural health, Griffin said that money won’t be enough to offset $1 trillion of cuts to the program over the next decade.
Many of the law’s most significant changes to Medicaid, including the work and eligibility requirements, don’t start until the end of 2026 or later. Meanwhile, SarahJane Guidry, CrescentCare’s policy and advocacy director, said the federally qualified health clinic’s team will focus on preparing their patients for the new requirements and training staff to work under the new system.
“ We’re preparing to make sure that that human impact and that burden is as small as it possibly can be,” Guidry said.
On Friday, top Democratic congressional leaders gathered in New Orleans at CrescentCare on Canal Street. U.S. Rep. Troy Carter, joined by House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries and other representatives, said Democrats will try to use any legislative tool available to roll back changes to Medicaid, especially if they gain a majority after midterm elections in 2026.
”We’re gonna find every opportunity to tweak, change and repeal,” Carter said.
As Congress works through a dozen appropriations bills for the next couple fiscal years, Rep. Debbie Wasserman-Schultz, who sits on the appropriations committee, said Democrats plan to propose amendments to reverse parts of the new law. But any such amendments would face an uphill battle in the Republican-led House and Senate.

(Photo: U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development.When Kelly Durrows was told two years ago that she qualified for an Emergency Housing Voucher, funded by federal recovery dollars, she assumed she would be added to another waiting list and wouldn’t exit homelessness for another year or two. 
But four months later, a case worker in Reno handed her a key to her apartment in ending her 15 years of on and off homelessness in 2023. She has been stably housed ever since. 
The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, signed into law by former President Joe Biden, included $5 billion in investments to create 70,000 emergency vouchers nationwide. 
More than 600 emergency vouchers are currently in use across Nevada according to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development data. 
“Normally each year, we’re able to move about 10 people into permanent supportive housing,”  said Catrina Peters, the homelessness services coordinator for Washoe County. 
The emergency housing vouchers “allowed us to make 137 referrals” to get people off the streets, she said.
The specialized vouchers were supposed to be funded through 2030, but jurisdictions around the country, including in Reno, were informed by HUD in March that they would receive a final allotment this year to cover “those remaining amounts will be available to cover (EVA Housing Assistance Program) costs in 2026.”
“We did always kind of have that (2030) end date in mind,” Peters said, adding that “the more recent correspondence to potentially end in the program in 2026 was quite a surprise.”
“We have extremely limited resources and extremely limited opportunities to serve these folks through other programs,” she said. “Any reduction in a program impacts our ability to get people housed and out of homelessness.”
Homelessness has steadily been on the rise in the state, as in most of the country. 
More than 10,100 people experienced homelessness in Nevada in 2024 – a 17% increase statewide – according to data released by HUD in December.
“We’re seeing rents not increasing as dramatically as they have been in the previous years, but still continuing to rise,” Peters said. “We have a lot of folks on fixed incomes who don’t see a corresponding increase to their income.”
Housing vouchers, already scarce, would be even harder to get under Trump’s budget bill

The end strategy for those emergency housing vouchers, Peters said, is to at some point have “them moved into the existing housing authority pool, or kind of absorbed into that existing voucher pool,” which is the Housing Choice Vouchers program, formerly known as Section 8.
More than 15,000 people receive standard housing vouchers statewide, with thousands on the waitlist hoping  to qualify for a voucher.
The regular housing voucher program is likely to face cuts as well. 
President Donald Trump 2026 fiscal budget proposed steep cuts across various agencies, including slashing the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development budget by more than 40%.
“I think if folks want to see a meaningful decrease in the number of people experiencing homelessness, people on the street, people living in cars, then we need to maintain these programs and not see any cuts,” Peters said. 
‘A golden ticket’
Durrows, 47, moved from California to Carson City about 15 years ago to live with her mom when she needed a place to stay while she was unemployed.
Her mother died a few months later, and her stepfather asked her to move out. Durrows relocated to Reno, got a job as a housekeeper, and moved into a new apartment. 
But she lost her job and could no longer afford rent. That was her first time experiencing homelessness. 
Durrows bounced around to Georgia and Texas, but eventually came back to Reno for good in 2018. 
“I barely slept. That’s when the drugs came in. I barely could sleep because I had to stay up and keep my dog warm and keep burning fires, and I had to keep hand warmers up under the blankets.”
Durrows briefly stayed at Reno’s Cares Campus Emergency Shelter in 2023 and was eventually connected with Michael Adragna, a case manager.
During that time, she qualified for an emergency housing voucher. Knowing there is a long wait list for unhoused people to get housing assistance, Durrows figured it was too good to be true
“When they told me that I was approved, I was like, ‘Yeah, okay, I’m approved, but it’s gonna take two, three years to get it,’ ” Durrows said.
But a few months later, she was in her new place. It’s the first time in her life that she has ever “felt planted,” she said. 
“I quit doing drugs,” she said. “I quit doing all this craziness.”
Even after Durrow’s first landlord decided not to renew the lease, she was able to secure another apartment using the same voucher. 
Adragna likened the emergency voucher to “a golden ticket.”
“The alternative programs with housing authority were kind of like being on a wait list to nowhere,” he said. 
Once people are on typical wait lists for various types of housing assistance, such as a housing choice voucher, Adragna said they could be on there “for maybe two to three years.”
What made these emergency vouchers more successful is they came with less stringent requirements from HUD, said Brenda Barnes, the social services manager for Clark County.
“These (vouchers) were more unique in regards to less deniability,” she said. “There are background checks and various other types of requirements for different vouchers. Some require a disability. These were a little bit more flexible, which made them more accessible.”
For the first time, the door to housing was open to people who typically don’t qualify for housing assistance, such as people with criminal backgrounds who can’t access traditional housing vouchers.
“It was exciting and amazing to see how quickly we utilized these vouchers” to help people “who were falling through the gaps in other resources in the community,” Barnes said.  
Peters said that in Washoe County roughly 90% of those who qualified for the emergency vouchers received case management, and have remained stably housed. 
The vouchers, and the household stability they enable, allows the county “to reduce community wide costs for people who were previously using the emergency room heavily and previously had a lot of interactions with law enforcement.” 
The emergency voucher program is “the last thing that should be cut,” Peters said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/54642266096_fd9c809767_o-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 09:04:28.932277

(Photo by Spenser Heaps for Utah News Dispatch)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Meanwhile, in Utah, enrollment changes were less than 1%, according to the report.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

Where is the district located?

The district covers part of Cullman, including Good Hope, Garden City, Colony and Smith Lake. 

How did the seat become vacant?

The seat became vacant after former Rep. Corey Harbison, R-Cullman, resigned in April after he was absent for much of the 2025 legislative session.

Does the seat have a partisan lean?

District 11 is solidly Republican. Harbison took over 85% of the vote in his re-election campaign in 2022.

What issues dominate the race?

SB 322, sponsored by Sen. Jabo Waggoner, R-Vestavia Hills, was signed by Gov. Kay Ivey on May 7. The bill allows the city of Cullman to annex a resort in Cullman County, a dry county, in order for the resort to serve alcohol. All four Republican candidates strongly oppose the legislation.
Cullman County did not have representation in the House after Harbison resigned in April and Rep. Randall Shedd, R-Fairview, resigned in February to work for Sen. Garlan Gudger, R-Cullman.

What happens after today?

The Republican with the most votes will face Democratic candidate Matthew Glover, a 40-year-old former Good Hope City councilman on Oct. 28. If a candidate does not receive 50% of the vote, a runoff primary election will be held on Aug. 12.

Will the results alter control of the Legislature?

No. Republicans currently hold 72 of the 105 seats in the Alabama House, after three resignations after the end of the 2025 session in May. Rep. Cynthia Almond, R-Tuscaloosa, was appointed president of the Public Service Commission in June. Rep. Matt Woods, R-Jasper, was elected to the State Senate on June 24. Rep. Debbie Wood, R-Valley, announced her resignation and move to the Florida panhandle last week. Republicans hold 27 of the 35 seats in the Alabama Senate.

Maribeth Leonard, CEO of LifeWays– a community mental health services program that serves Hillsdale and Jackson counties– outlined how this proposal could upend Michigan’s existing system of regionally governed behavioral health oversight.
In a letter to the community. Leonard said the change in the funding model would “move decisions about mental health care funding and oversight further from the communities they serve, threatening the transparency, accountability, and responsiveness that define Michigan’s public system.”

LETTER TO THE EDITOR – Protecting Local Mental Health Care from Privatization – 07.09.2025 
Michigan’s current infrastructure comprises ten Prepaid Inpatient Health Plans, or PIHP. These regional administrative entities are charged with managing a region’s behavioral health Medicaid funds. The Mid-State Health Network, for example, serves 21 counties and consists of 11 different community mental health organizations, including LifeWays.
This is not the first time prepaid plans have been threatened with privatization. Indeed, there have been at least five serious attempts over the past decade. Most recently, bills introduced by Republican lawmakers in 2021 stalled in the state Legislature after encountering significant opposition from mental health advocates. Before that, in 2019, Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, issued a line-item veto rejecting a budget provision that would have advanced a privatization pilot program first introduced under the administration of former Republican Gov. Rick Snyder. SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In this instance, however, the push for privatization comes not from a Republican-led legislature, but from a department within the state’s Democratic-led executive branch: the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services.
According to MDHHS, the shift to competitive procurement is intended “to address issues within the current PIHP system that compromise service quality, accountability, and efficiency.” The department cited “fragmentation, service inconsistency, and limited accountability” as critical flaws in the current PIHP system.
The department is advancing a plan that would open the contracts for regional prepaid plans to competitive bidding, allowing large nonprofit entities with no local ties to apply. A letter from LifeWays CEO Maribeth Leonard explained that, while the proposal “requires that bidders be nonprofit entities, it still allows large private nonprofits —some of which may operate outside of our region or even our state, like Blue Cross Blue Shield or Meridian Health Plan— to take over functions currently managed by locally governed public agencies.”
The state health department conducted a month-long survey in March 2025, reaching out to 2,600 Michiganders and garnering various perspectives. In a statement to Michigan Advance, the agency elaborated that the plan for privatization was “informed by extensive feedback” from Medicaid beneficiaries and their families, community-based organizations, advocacy groups, and other partners.
In addressing the survey responses, the department said that the proposed plan would “help to increase consumer choice and access to services while preserving the Community Mental Health Services Programs (CMHSPs).”
PIHP public survey summary
Furthermore, the department used the survey responses to develop a four-pillared approach to their proposal, striving to “provide high quality, timely services, improve choice & consistency across regions,  ensure accountability & transparency, and  simplify the system with reduced bureaucracy.”
Interestingly, while both state health department and mental health advocates cite accountability, transparency, and improved response as primary objectives, they propose fundamentally different solutions to achieve them. 
Leonard pointed out that the implementation of this proposal could have unintended consequences, namely increased wait times, lower service quality, decreased provider rates, and heightened rates of provider turnover and closures.
Leonard’s concerns are a reality for several other states: Oklahoma predicted that privatizing mental health care would cost the state an additional $716 million annually. A June 2024 state report from Oregon found that privatization had led to an influx of “phantom networks”—provider directories listing clinicians who aren’t actually accepting patients. North Carolina saw a drastic increase in staff turnover in public-sector mental health, as well as significant increases in behavioral health-related emergency room visits. 
In a letter to Governor Gretchen Whitmer, the Michigan Association of Counties explained that private health plans operate at higher cost than their public counterparts. The current system spends approximately 2% of Medicaid funding on administrative costs, marketing, billing, and executive salaries. On the other hand, privatized infrastructures typically spend around 15% on these overhead costs.
In short, the letter continues, “such an increase would divert over $500 million annually from direct services to administrative expenses, exacerbating existing funding shortfalls and diminishing the quality and accessibility of care.”

PIHP-Letter-to-Governor-May-2025 
Similarly, Leonard emphasized that even if the infrastructure is reduced, the necessity remains. The only difference, she noted, is that those in need of mental health services will end up elsewhere.
 “They’re going to end up in other places–in your jails, they’re going to end up in your emergency departments,” said Leonard. “The need won’t go away.”
 “The other key thing,” she added, “is that right now, the mental health code requires, on our board, the participation of those with lived experience. You’re not going to have that with a private plan.”
The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services plans to issue a request for proposal sometime this summer, with the proposed service start date scheduled for October 1, 2026. At this point, the language of the proposal has yet to be formalized.
However, Leonard noted that, based on the preliminary proposal requirements, none of Michigan’s prepaid plans would be eligible to apply. In short, another organization would be able to take control of the state’s mental and behavioral health infrastructure.
Further, she explained, shifting towards a privatized model would divert decision-making power away from the communities. Unlike the current infrastructure, private non-profits are not subject to Freedom of Information Act requests, which would leave the community with limited tools to monitor decision-making, spending, or performance. Essentially, Leonard explained, the proposal “threaten[s] the transparency, accountability, and responsiveness that define Michigan’s public system.”

(Photo"" iStock/Getty Images)People like me usually defend civil rights as a moral and humanitarian cause, as well as a cornerstone of American democracy, but civil rights also have a measurable economic value and attacking them quickly imposes a real cost. Just as a breakdown in the rule of law creates investment uncertainty that undermines economic growth, undermining civil rights can shatter peoples’ confidence about working, living and spending money here. 
While we’re often reminded that freedom isn’t free, we’re learning now in Nevada that the alternative ain’t cheap either.  President Donald Trump’s arrests and deportations of immigrants and protesters – often without due process or criminal charges – are already taking a toll.  Las Vegas is suffering a slowdown only a few months into Trump’s second term. Tourism is slipping by virtually every measure: hotel occupancies and daily room rates; the number of international visitors; sales tax and gaming revenue. 
Nevada’s Economic Forum, the panel of economic forecasters that prepares the state’s budget assumptions, reduced its 2025 revenue estimate in May by $191 million, about 1.6%. That’s largely because of declining sales taxes and gaming fees.  On top of that, the consensus forecast by the General Assembly’s Legislative Counsel Bureau cut its estimate for the State Education Fund by $160 million.  
To be sure, threats to civil rights aren’t the only cause of that. Trump’s tariffs have played a major role, slowing economic growth and increasing economic uncertainty.  
But the threat to individual civil liberties is a real factor as well. Many European governments, from Germany and France to Denmark and Ireland, have recently issued travel advisories that warn people about new risks travelling to the United States.  These advisories warn that even minor paperwork glitches, or people who identify their gender as “X” on their passports, can jeopardize more than just a vacation. As the German government tells its citizens traveling here, “[e]ven slightly overstaying a travel visa can lead to arrest, detention and deportation.” And that caution is exceedingly polite. European media has been awash in horror stories about travelers who were jailed for weeks for no good reason.
Fabian Schmidt, a German who has a U.S. green card as well as an American partner and daughter, was detained for two months after returning to the U.S. from Luxembourg.   Jessica Brösche, a Berlin tattoo artist on vacation, was held for six weeks – including nine days in solitary – even though she had a valid visa.  Small wonder that Der Spiegel, Germany’s leading news magazine, called U.S. immigration practices “capricious and uncoordinated.” Even the most popular TikTok’er in the world ended up detained by ICE while passing through Las Vegas.
The drop in foreign tourism has been dramatic and statistically significant. For example, Canadian travelers – who make up the largest share of international visitors to Las Vegas – are staying away in droves. Between the blindsiding tariffs imposed on their country, talks of making Canada the fifty-first state, and disturbing reports of Canadians detained for days in ICE facilities over minor visa issues, who could blame them?
We should only expect the international tourist numbers to get worse. Considering reports that customs enforcement have taken to searching people’s phones and denying entry to folks who criticize Donald Trump or his administration, why should we think anyone just looking to have some fun would subject themselves to that sort of treatment?
Part of what makes Las Vegas attractive and globally competitive is its demonstrable safety and security.  The Strip is one the most surveilled areas in the world.  Street crime is very low, and it’s known to be low.  Las Vegas is also one of the world’s most culturally diverse and open cities.  Black, white, Asian, straight, gay, transgender — the city attracts just about any group imaginable.
That’s why tourists, regardless of their nationality, race or gender, throng the streets late at night. This is a huge competitive advantage over other international destinations. All that can change, however, if visitors have to worry about arbitrary detention, deportation, harassment and the absence of due process.  If the U.S. is no longer safe, tourists have other choices and will increasingly go elsewhere.

,California,2025-07-15 12:00:00+00:00,CalMatters,LA Times valiantly explains how Los Angeles became the epicenter of homelessness,Dan Walters,,,,,https://calmatters.org/commentary/2025/07/la-times-explains-epicenter-homelessness/,The Los Angeles Times recently made a valiant attempt to explain how homelessness became a seemingly intractable crisis in L.A. County.,"At its best, journalism reveals the reality that is often obscured in the superficial political rhetoric about high-profile current events.
In California, nothing outranks homelessness as a burning issue and as a political football. Officialdom, from the governor down, not only cannot agree on why the state has so many unhoused people — numerically and relatively the largest such population of any state — but what should be done to ameliorate it.
Tens of billions of dollars have been spent over the last half-decade, but the numbers often rise as state and local officials engage in a blame game, an implicit acknowledgement that voters might punish politicians deemed to have failed.
The Los Angeles Times recently made a valiant attempt to explain how homelessness arose and became a seemingly intractable crisis in Los Angeles County. The exhaustive report, headlined “The real story of how L.A. became the epicenter of America’s homeless crisis,” published last week.
“Today, homelessness feels as inevitable a part of the urban landscape as traffic jams and strip malls,” the journalists accurately observed. “Los Angeles has more people living on the streets than any other city in the United States, which almost certainly makes it the homelessness capital of the developed world.
“There are 15 counties in California whose total populations are smaller than the homeless population of L.A. County, which exceeded 75,000 people in 2023. If you filled Dodger Stadium with all the county’s homeless people, you’d have enough left over to fill Crypto.com Arena downtown.”
The newspaper’s reportage team, led by former Times staffers Mitchell Landsberg and Gale Holland, dived deeply into Southern California’s history — particularly its housing patterns. The conclusion was that the region’s bias for single-family housing, its historic enmity toward housing for low-income residents — particularly nonwhite residents — and “urban renewal” projects that upset neighborhoods and destroyed affordable housing were among the root causes.
Economic upheaval — particularly the loss of good-paying industrial jobs after the World War II boom wore off — was another factor, along with the decreasing mental health care and other social maladies.
“While mental illness, poor medical care, substance abuse, growing income inequality, job loss, racism or another social ill might have been the most visible trigger that put any one person on the street, the housing problem is why they had nowhere else to land,” the Times said, adding, “And it was decisions by policymakers, judges, law enforcement and industrial leaders that caused the shortage.”
All of those factors were at play in the 1970s when the last piece of the homelessness puzzle emerged as the region was beginning to see a new population boom driven largely by immigration from other countries.
“Finally, and crucially, housing prices doubled in Los Angeles from 1975 to 1979 — an extraordinary escalation driven in part by a growing population, inflation and real estate speculation,” the Times reported. “Prices would double several more times in the coming years as the average cost of a home rose from $25,000 in the early 1970s to more than $1 million today. Even adjusting for inflation, a house in Los Angeles today costs roughly six times what it did then and is no longer within reach for the average working-class Angeleno.”
So there it is, a detailed and compelling explanation of why the City of Angels exemplifies California’s homelessness problem and, implicitly, the reason why making inroads is so difficult.
If the most important factor is a lack of affordable housing, the most powerful remedy would be to build more affordable housing, but institutional, political and economic barriers remain rock-solid. California — not just Los Angeles — has been falling behind on housing production for many years despite state-level efforts to reduce those barriers, the latest being an exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act for certain kinds of high-density projects.
On Monday, Los Angeles County officials announced that the latest survey, conducted in January, found a 3,000-person (4%) decline in homelessness from the previous year’s 75,312.
That’s good news, certainly, but the homeless crisis remains and will persist until the housing crisis is solved.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/11082022-LA-StreetMedicine-LV_CM-22.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-15 08:02:11.580191

“The Social Security Administration (SSA) is celebrating the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the email message began — using the official name of the massive legislation signed by President Donald Trump that cuts taxes and also slashes spending on Medicaid and SNAP, along with making numerous other policy changes.
White, 71, who lives in Middleton, Wisconsin, has been getting Social Security Administration email since he retired from the Beloit College psychology faculty in 2019. But until the July 4 message, he said, every single one has been straightforward, factual — and nonpolitical.
The message included a misleading description of one provision in the new law. The Social Security Administration later published a correction.
That alone angered White. But that the message was sent at all was just as irritating, he told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The email, including a quote from Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano, “appeared to value currying favor with the president over telling Americans the truth,” White said. “I want our federal agencies to be independent, nonpartisan offices that act with integrity and serve the public, not the president.”
The Social Security message claims that the legislation “ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits…”
“This is a historic step forward for America’s seniors,” Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano stated.
  A screenshot of the Social Security Administration message sent to the agency’s email list early July 4, 2025.
As was soon widely reported, however, the message itself was off the mark.
“I was surprised to see SSA send this out as an email to such a large list since this seems more about politics than anything specific to the program,” said J. Michael Collins, a household economics expert at the University of Wisconsin. Collins directed a Social Security research center at the UW until the Trump administration shut it down earlier this year.
The actual change that the message refers to is to income taxes paid by all people 65 or older with incomes $75,000 a year or less for single filers and $150,000 a year or less for couples — regardless of whether they’re collecting Social Security or not, Collins explained.
While the message appears to single out Social Security income, “there is no new exemption of SSA income from federal income taxes, just a new deduction for all people 65+ regardless of income source,” Collins told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message.
For people who are 64 or younger and who get income from Social Security, there’s no comparable tax cut, he added.
To be sure, the reduction does give some help to taxpayers 65 or older who collect Social Security.
A 2022 IRS tax tip explains that half of Social Security income is taxable for  a single person whose income is $25,000 to $34,000 and for a married couple filing jointly whose income is $32,000 to $44,000.
For a single person with income over $34,000 or a married couple with income over $44,000, 85% of their Social Security income is taxable.
Social Security beneficiaries with incomes below the $75,000 or $150,000 ceiling will get relief from those tax bills — along with everyone else 65 or older whose income also falls below those limits.
The tax break also lasts just a few years, ending in 2028 — stretching the claim that qualifying beneficiaries “will no longer” pay income taxes.
The email message produced a sharp blowback.
“I was appalled — it was really unprecedented,” Nancy Altman, president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone interview. “They’ve taken an agency that’s supposed to be above politics and made it an arm of propaganda.”
Altman recalled that when Social Security checks were mailed in October 1972, President Richard Nixon suggested including an insert in which he could take credit for a benefit increase — even though he had initially opposed it. The commissioner at the time, Robert Ball, threatened to resign if Nixon followed through, and Nixon backed off, Altman said.
As originally worded, the email message appeared to suggest two separate tax cut provisions — one for Social Security recipients 65 and older and one for others:
“The new law includes a provision that eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries, providing relief to individuals and couples. Additionally, it provides an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older, ensuring that retirees can keep more of what they have earned.”
On July 7, the Social Security Administration added a correction and changed the second sentence in that paragraph to, “It does so by providing an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older…”
The correction was previously reported by HuffPost reporter Arthur Delaney.
The morning that he received the Social Security message, White, the retired Beloit professor, wrote back to Bisignano directly — guessing at a direct email address for the Trump-appointed Social Security Commissioner.
“Commissioner Bisignano, When did the Social Security Administration become so blatantly political? I thought government agencies like the USPS were supposed to just go about their business from one administration to the next, but clearly that’s not the case with the SSA. You have become an unabashed mouthpiece for Trump. Shame on you!”
“I was upset that the head of a major federal agency would act in a way that undermines the public’s trust,” White told the Wisconsin Examiner.
“For years, Trump has expressed contempt for America’s once-revered institutions — courts, universities, the press, medical experts, climate scientists, long-time allies abroad … the list is a long one,” White added. “Trump wants to diminish any group or individual who questions his aims or methods.”
The email message appears to play directly to that characteristic of the president, he said, and White fears that will diminish the agency in the public eye.
“What upsets me is that the commissioner of the SSA foolishly wrote a letter that will prompt millions of Americans to question the integrity of the SSA,” White said. “It takes years for an organization to build up a good reputation, but it can be fatally damaged almost overnight.”

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)An Alabama legislator wants to expand the number of circumstances that can allow the death penalty to be imposed.
Rep. Matt Simpson, R-Daphne, has prefiled HB 20 for the 2026 session, which would make it a capital offense to murder a person while “knowingly creat(ing) a great risk of death to multiple persons.”
“There are some instances that I feel we should be able to go after the maximum punishment, and increase that punishment to the death penalty, in cases that they have committed these offenses in a public place and in a public manner,” Simpson said in an interview Monday.
Alabama statute outlines 21 circumstances that enhance the penalty to allow the state to charge someone with capital punishment, such as murdering a person who is less than 14 years old or committing the offense in the presence of someone younger than 14 years old, or killing someone while in commission of a robbery or kidnapping. Murdering a law enforcement officer could also enhance a murder charge to a capital offense.
“It is murder that can be moved to capital murder if it falls under one of those enhancements,” Simpson said. “This bill creates the enhancement for causing danger to multiple people.”
Simpson said he believes the bill would serve as a warning that committing the gravest crimes can come with the harshest punishments.
“I think that capital murder will send a message to the community that we are no longer taking this,” Simpson said. “We have seen an increase in public shootings, a significant increase of this in public areas.”
Carla Crowder, executive director of Alabama Appleseed, a criminal justice reform group, said in a statement that evidence showed that “certainty of arrest and conviction is the greatest deterrent to crime, not length of sentence or level of punishment.” Some civil rights groups have said that capital punishment does not deter crime. Crowder said investments in mental health care and violence prevention would work to cut crime in the state.
“Common sense tells us that someone who’s enraged enough to shoot into a crowd of people is probably not going to check the Code of Alabama to determine whether they’d be subject to death or just life in prison before pulling the trigger,” the statement said.
Simpson also introduced legislation in the spring during the 2025 session that would have also expanded eligibility for the death penalty for those who sexually assault minors. The bill, which did not pass, would have joined Alabama with Florida and Tennessee as the states to pass such laws.
“I am optimistic, I am going to file that bill again and hopefully get it a little further,” Simpson said. “There are a lot of good bills that died in the Senate this year due to timing, and I will see how things play out. Sometimes it takes multiple years for a bill to pass.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Senate-May-11-2023-18-Matt-Simpson-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 08:02:11.580191

(Andrea Tinker/Alabama Reflector)BIRMINGHAM — A group of 30 protestors gathered in front of the offices of U.S. Rep. Gary Palmer, R-Hoover on Monday in protest of the reconciliation bill passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump earlier this month. 
Protestors, part of the Alabama Poor People’s Campaign Moral Monday, cited figures from Repairers of the Breach that estimated the bill would cost 42,000 Alabamians Medicaid and 165,000 benefits from SNAP, a federal program aimed at curbing hunger in America. 
Rev. Carolyn Foster of Greater Birmingham Ministries led the protest, which included clergy, advocates and people who said they will be affected by cuts in the legislation. Foster said amplifying the stories of people who are going to be directly affected by the Reconciliation Bill is important.
“These are people who have families, these are people who are cared for in their communities and who take care of their own communities, so we want to put a face to these numbers,” she said.
Palmer voted for the bill in the U.S. House of Representatives earlier this month. A message seeking comment was left with Palmer’s office Monday. 
Monday’s demonstration is a part of the national strategy put together by Bishop William Barber, the founder of the Poor People’s Campaign and Repairers of the Breach. Alabama was one of 10 states in the south scheduled to have a demonstration against the Reconciliation Bill on Monday, including a flagship protest in Memphis.
LaTrell Clifford Wood, a hunger policy advocate for Alabama Arise, spoke at the demonstration about her personal experience with food insecurity and the health care system.Wood said when she was 14 years old, her family lost access to SNAP benefits and school meals, which came as her mother also struggled to pay for needed medication.
“I was old enough to notice my mom’s distress,” she said. “Fourteen is old enough to notice your parents’ distress, even when she tried to hide it. So I stopped asking for lunch money. Instead I would say I wasn’t hungry and asked my teacher if I could stay inside and draw during lunch to distract myself,” she said.
Wood said with the bill being signed, she’s scared that there will be more stories similar to hers.
“Children in Alabama deserve the chance to be children and to learn and grow and make their own mistakes,” Wood said. “They should not have to bear the burden of the poor moral compasses of those elected officials whose voting record tells them to tough it out.”
The demonstrators also had a list of ways the bill will negatively impact residents, including:

Death by denial of health care
Hospitals in rural areas face closure
Food assistance will be removed from people
Squeezing states on SNAP
Barring lawfully present immigrants from aid
Separating immigrant families
Tax cuts benefit the wealthiest households
Corporate tax rate remains the same
Higher energy costs
Funding war and enriching war profiteers

Protestors attempted to present the list to Palmer’s staff. The office door was not answered.
In a press release, Carolyn Foster said lawmakers are disconnected from their constituents and often pass laws that will not benefit them.
“Alabama’s poor and low-income population make up 47% of the electorate in this state. To our lawmakers, they are invisible people,” she said. “Our lawmakers are disconnected from the realities of people needing health care and food assistance. It is shameful that they willingly push the sick, the hungry, the elderly and the disabled into suffering and possibly death.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Gary-Palmer-Protest-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 08:02:11.580191

(Courtesy of the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs)Housing advocates are urging New Jersey lawmakers to return to Trenton this summer to replenish a fund intended to help produce affordable housing.
The $58.8 billion budget lawmakers passed on June 30 includes a diversion of $125 million away from that fund, leaving just $5 million — an amount advocates say is insufficient to address the state’s affordable housing shortage.
Edward Bethea is chair of the nonprofit Housing and Community Development Network of New Jersey, a statewide association of community development corporations.
“This could be reversed immediately,” Edward Bethea told reporters Monday. “And it should be reversed immediately so that we can get back to the business of building these units and changing family lives.”
New Jersey faces a deficit of as many as 300,000 affordable housing units, according to Staci Berger, the network’s president and CEO. Matthew Hersh, its vice president of policy and advocacy, said that the decision to redirect funds will have a significant impact on New Jersey.
“The work is about affordable home production, but also about stabilizing neighborhoods and creating other services centered around housing that can help create a community development ecosystem,” Hersh said.
State officials defended the move to divert the funds from the affordable housing fund, noting that the money instead is being used for other housing-related programs, like a down payment assistance program, supportive housing, Medicaid housing assistance, and more. The down payment assistance program will get $40 million in the new budget.
Tyler Jones, a spokeswoman for Gov. Phil Murphy, said the new budget builds on the governor’s prior efforts “with the funding of several initiatives creating pathways to affordable housing.”
“Over the past seven and a half years, the Murphy Administration’s Department of Community Affairs has invested almost $250 million into housing production, supporting the construction of nearly 1,600 affordable housing units. The New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency has also created and preserved more than 30,000 additional affordable housing units,” Jones said.
Criticism remains. Scott Millard, CEO of Passaic County Habitat for Humanity, said the funding diversion will halt previously funded housing development projects, including 144 homes from Habitat for Humanity affiliates across the state.
Berger said affordability will be a central concern for voters as they determine who will become our next governor when Murphy leaves office in January (he cannot seek a third term in November). A new Rutgers-Eagleton poll found that 85% of residents are dissatisfied with the state’s approach to affordability and the cost of living.
“It defies logic and explanation that the Legislature and the governor would take funding that is directly connected to and supportive of creating more affordable homes,” Berger said. “We don’t know why they did this, but we know they are going to hear from us.”

Fulop says that's false.,"A former aide to Jersey City Mayor Steve Fulop says he was fired in part for blowing the whistle on unethical behavior. Fulop says that's false. (Reena Rose Sibayan for New Jersey Monitor)Jersey City attorneys want a judge to dismiss new claims in a lawsuit filed by an employee who was fired last year during a dust-up over his sister’s controversial campaign to become Missouri’s secretary of state.  
Jonathan Gomez Noriega, a former aide to Mayor Steve Fulop, has made new allegations that his firing was in part because he blew the whistle on what Gomez Noriega calls Fulop’s “improper” push to invest retirement funds in cryptocurrency. Attorneys for Fulop and the city called those allegations “entirely threadbare and implausible.”
“Under even the most liberal construction, the activities Plaintiff describes do not constitute protected ‘whistleblowing activity,’” city attorneys wrote in a 65-page brief filed last week.
Fulop, a Democrat, has said Gomez Noriega was fired because he supported his sister’s “controversial political campaign.” Valentina Gomez, who is known for her anti-LGBTQ+ stances and rhetoric attacking undocumented immigrants, lost her election in Missouri last year and now says she is seeking a House seat in Texas. 
The federal judge overseeing Gomez Noriega’s suit in April dismissed four of the original six counts, then allowed Gomez Noriega to amend his complaint over the city’s objections. The new allegations claim Fulop improperly made a “unilateral” announcement to invest city retirement funds with cryptocurrency without informing members of the board overseeing the retirement system.
Gomez Noriega’s new complaint notes that Fulop and a super PAC supporting his failed bid to become governor this year received $77,000 from the vice president of a cryptocurrency trading platform. The campaign donations “might reasonably be expected to impair (Fulop’s) objective or independence of judgment,” the new complaint says, and could constitute a breach of state ethics law.
Fulop’s team calls those allegations “nonsensical.” Fulop’s announcement was simply that the city was updating the paperwork it needed to invest in Bitcoin funds, not that there would be investments in cryptocurrencies, city attorneys say.
They also note that the political contributions were made over an eight-year period, and Gomez Noriega provides no allegations that “might suggest that these donations had a corrupting influence on Mayor Fulop.”
“That is exactly the kind of unsubstantiated logical leap that federal courts routinely object,” attorneys said in the filing.
An attorney for Gomez Noriega did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  John McCormick: Compare Vermont to Kerrville, Texas.","Dear Editor,


Vermont is not preparing fast enough for its changing climate, though there are signals from abnormal precipitation patterns, warmer summers and invasives. 
When is it “too late” for a community that will never return? Perhaps communities have a choice to declare floodplains unsafe for development aside from agriculture and timbering.
Reading accounts of this horrific flood in Texas taking so many children with it, I learned of the several official discussions about installing a flood warning system. It was deemed too expensive. 
Vermont’s government will need to apply measures to adapt to this wetter, warmer future.
I call out the clean heat standard advocates and lobbyists to give time and attention to redesigning where and how we live.
We have time and money to enforce the Global Warming Solutions Act to lower fossil fuel emissions by a few million tons in a world that emits 35 billion.
And, we have time and money to prepare our children and families to adapt to those changes — including more efficient use of energy and agriculture designed to thrive in those changes. 
Housing, education and health care will also succumb to those changes and there is time to adapt.

The Hartland farm store decision highlights a need for Act 250 reform.
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Todd Heyman: Vermont planning commissions should not legislate or litigate.","This commentary is by Todd Heyman of Hartland. He is co-owner of Fat Sheep Farm & Cabins, and an Act 250 permit holder.


The Vermont Supreme Court recently ruled that a Sunnymede Farm store and restaurant could open just off I-91 in an area the town of Hartland had designated as rural in its 2017 town plan. The project was granted an Act 250 permit over the appeals of the Hartland Planning Commission and the Two Rivers Ottauquechee Regional Planning Commission. Notably, the Hartland Selectboard, a body of elected officials, did not appeal the permit.
The Court’s decision was based on the inconsistent language in the town plan. In one section, there was language severely curtailing commercial activity in rural areas and, in another, that particular area by the highway was described as suitable for rural business development. The Court held that the inconsistency did not give fair notice to landowners of what was proscribed.

The decision highlights a need for Act 250 reform.
First, Act 250 should not enforce land use rules in plans that have not been individually warned and voted on by the town’s selectboard.
Second, neither regional nor municipal planning commissions should be afforded party status in Act 250 proceedings.
These reforms would promote transparency, eliminate some appeals, increase efficiency and leave land use decisions in the hands of accountable, elected officials. 
The Legislature’s current approach to Act 250 reform is to determine which projects should be spared the full brunt of Act 250 permitting instead of improving the permitting process for all applicants. It’s an unnecessary surrender to the unspoken consensus that the permitting scheme will never work well, and certain projects, like housing, should be exempted from Act 250. 
The Sunnymede case is just one of dozens where lawyers collected hefty fees squabbling over which plan language was meant to be mandatory. These disputes arise almost exclusively in no-zoning towns because zoning ordinances must be warned and voted on by both planning commissions and selectboards. Accordingly, the intended mandatory effect of the ordinances is obvious.
This is good government. Notice should be given for proposed laws that impair property rights so the public can deliberate prior to any vote on the rule. 
Ironically, no-zoning towns express much less interest in regulating development but can hide new land use regulations in large plan documents that address dozens of issues about the town’s future without ever calling attention to the proposed rules in a meeting warning, let alone warning an individualized vote on each proposed rule. Without such protections, lawyers and courts are kept busy deciding which handful of sentences in a hundred-plus page plan are mandatory.
This is bad government. It is undemocratic. 
The Hartland Planning Commission itself, an unelected body, has buried significant changes in land use rules in past proposed plans. The meeting warnings referenced the plan’s various sections without mentioning the specifics of the new rules.
And plans are approved by both the planning commissions and selectboards with a single vote. No rule is guaranteed an individualized vote or debate before its inclusion in the plan. Those missing democratic protections are needed not just for fairness but also better outcomes.
By requiring individualized warnings and votes on the rules, disputes like Sunnymede would be eliminated because the selectboard would have made clear which plan language was mandatory. Eliminating this uncertainty would make Act 250 work better and reduce its deterrent effect on good projects whose principals are wary of the cost and time constraints of Act 250 permitting.
Indeed, because abutting neighbors are given party status, they can (and do) block projects for years in court based on inconclusive language in enormous planning documents. 
But that’s not the only reform needed. Planning commissions should not be afforded party status in Act 250 proceedings. With just a few municipal exceptions, planning commissions are not elected officials who can be replaced by the voters. Nor is there any independent ethical oversight of commission members who are frequently members of the business community. 
For example, the Two Rivers Planning Commission chair is an angus beef producer who operates a restaurant. How could Sunnymede, also an angus beef producer seeking to open its own restaurant in a neighboring town, raise the ethical conflict without antagonizing the commission and risking the project? 
Even if the chair had recused himself (he did not), the staff’s impartiality could also be fairly questioned. Regional planning commissions are small organizations and the relationships between the staff and board tend to be close and familiar.
In addition, staff answer to their board members, and their continued employment depends on their board’s approval of their work. Act 250 applicants should be concerned about these incentives in the absence of any meaningful ethical oversight.
In short, nothing would be lost by limiting planning commissions to proposing rules for selectboard adoption as mandatory, and letting only selectboards decide whether to enforce them in an Act 250 proceeding.
Taxpayer money, tens of thousands in the case of Hartland, was spent by unelected officials fighting over vague plan language that they themselves drafted. The days of scouring enormous planning documents to identify the “mandatory” rules should have ended long before now.

As of Monday, political committees funded largely by businesses had shelled out $330,000 on mailers, texts and digital ads opposing two appointed Democratic state senators: Deb Krishnadasan and Victoria Hunt. The groups hope Republicans can unseat both this fall.
Krishnadasan, who represents the 26th Legislative District, is up against Rep. Michelle Caldier, a veteran lawmaker. Hunt, who moved from the House to the Senate in the 5th Legislative District after the death of Bill Ramos, is facing former state lawmaker Chad Magendanz.  
Those opposing the senators see the two contests as a barometer of whether voters think Democrats overreached this year with taxes. Democrats pushed through $9.4 billion of tax increases to shore up the state’s general fund and another $3.2 billion of hikes for transportation, anchored by a 6-cent per gallon bump in the gas tax. 
The onslaught of negative campaign pieces — coming weeks ahead of the Aug. 5 primary — aims to highlight how the senators voted on taxes and other high-profile issues.
“We don’t need to wait. We can start changing hearts and minds throughout the summer and fall,” said Jim Walsh, chair of the state Republican Party.

 Primary Election
Ballots will be mailed Friday, July 18 for the Aug. 5 primary election.
Across the state, there are 239 contests including races for nine state legislative offices.
The two top finishers in each primary race will advance to the November general election.
You can find more information on the Secretary of State’s website.


Enterprise Washington, which advocates for pro-business policies in Olympia, is funneling money through its political committee, Jobs PAC, to separate committees in each race. The political committee has raised $305,000 this calendar year on top of $138,000 unspent from last year. 
The largest contributions to Jobs PAC in 2025 have come from the Washington State Dental PAC and the Washington Hospitality Association. Other donors include Puget Sound Energy, Koch Industries, Chevron Corp., Associated General Contractors, the Washington Retail Association and Washington Realtors.
Some of the most significant tax increases legislators approved this year fall on businesses, and some Democrats wanted to go further and impose even heftier levies on large companies. 
“This was a tough session for the business community, so it is not surprising that businesses would be participating aggressively this election cycle,” said Nathan Gorton, CEO of Washington Realtors, one of the larger donors to East King County Jobs, a political committee targeting Hunt.
The leader of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee said the early attacks are needed to overcome negativity toward GOP candidates due to Republican President Donald Trump’s unpopularity in Washington.
“The conservative interests backing Republicans in these races know they’re facing tough headwinds. Which is why they are out early, relentlessly sending spam texts and overflowing mailboxes with negative attacks,” said Katy Ozog, executive director of the Washington Senate Democratic Campaign.
Krishnadasan, of Gig Harbor, is taking the heavier fire thus far, though she did vote against her party’s major tax bills and transportation revenue package. Sound Jobs, backed by Enterprise Washington, had spent $171,311 against her as of Monday.
“My district is the most competitive in the state, and I’m not surprised that Chevron and Koch Industries are spending big to mislead voters,” she said in a statement. “I am the only candidate in this race who will protect against President Trump’s damaging policies, not advocate for them, and that’s why these special interests are attacking me.”
Caldier, also of Gig Harbor, has not been the target of hit pieces. But those will come, she said, as Democrats are determined to hold onto their 30-19 majority in the Senate, 
“I fully assumed I’d be attacked by now,” she said. “I have no intention of being nasty toward Deb at all. I am running to help save our state and that starts with ending the supermajority.”
Hunt, of Issaquah, won her House seat last November with 54% of the vote. She was appointed to the Senate after the session. Unlike her colleague, she did vote for the taxes, and her opponents sent four mailers in four days earlier this month to make that point. East King County Jobs has spent $161,000 against her.
Hunt, in a statement, pushed back on criticism of her tax votes.
“I’m proud of my vote for a budget that balanced billions in difficult cuts with key investments in education and health care. I’ll keep fighting for affordability, opportunity, and to safeguard our rights,” she said.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/money-dollars.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 07:05:31.842807

John Hoffman could have been a mass slaughter. 
Police found five firearms in the shooter’s SUV, including assault rifles with a “large quantity of ammunition organized into loaded magazines.” They recovered close to 50 guns from his home. The shooter had a long list of targets. If Hope Hoffman had not called 911, it’s likely more people –– including more of Minnesota’s top elected officials –– would have been injured or killed.  
This tragedy puts into stark relief a rising threat: Our toxic politics combined with easy access to firearms is increasing the risk of political violence and undermining our democratic system. 
The Minnesota attacks are merely the most recent examples of a surge in political violence, including the mass shooting at a congressional baseball practice, the attack at the U.S. Capitol, the assault of Nancy Pelosi’s husband, and two attempted assassinations of President Trump. Political violence is increasing in the United States, and the American public views it as a major problem. 
This rise in political violence coincides with our increasing negative polarization –– how much Americans dislike the political party opposing their own. Although polarization is not a problem unique to the United States, Americans’ feelings of animosity toward members of the opposing political party have increased faster over time than similar democracies. The social media response to the Minnesota attacks demonstrated the ignominious depths of our affective polarization; posts, many rife with misinformation, were primarily focused on whether the shooter was a Democrat or Republican, rather than condemning the violence itself.
This toxic political environment is taking place in a country with high levels of gun violence and easy access to firearms. Americans are 26 times more likely to be killed by gun homicide than people in other high-income countries. We do not have more violent citizens; rather we have gun laws that make it easy for dangerous people to get a gun. 
In Minnesota, you have to obtain a permit to purchase a firearm and/or a permit to carry, but in many states, there are no such requirements. And while federally licensed dealers must conduct background checks on their gun sales, there’s a loophole in many states where dealers at gun shows and online (who are not federally licensed) conduct no background check whatsoever. 
Hortman worked to close that loophole in Minnesota in 2023, but many states continue to have private sales with no check at all. And there is currently a federal concealed carry bill that would usurp the ability of states to regulate the carrying of firearms in their states, and make it even easier for those with bad intentions to transport firearms across state lines.
When a formerly law-abiding citizen radicalizes without showing outward signs, it is challenging to identify him as a person who should not have access to a firearm. This may or may not be the case with Hortmans’ murderer; law enforcement is just beginning its investigation. But in states with extreme risk protection orders, like Minnesota, law enforcement at least has a tool in situations where someone is spiraling out of control. States with stronger gun laws — like background checks on all gun sales, extreme risk protection orders, and assault weapon bans — have lower rates of gun violence. Conversely, states with the weakest gun laws have some of the highest rates. dd
What happened in Minnesota strikes at the very core of our political system. Elected officials must be able to serve the public without fear that they’re going to be gunned down in their homes. Enacting effective public policy, especially in divided government, is challenging in the best of times, let alone under threat of violence. And if potential leaders fear that threat, they may choose not to run and represent their communities in the first place. 
Lax gun laws make political violence that much easier and more deadly, and accordingly, gun safety reform is an essential tool in combating it.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/gun-rack-1024x678.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 07:05:31.842807

But several critics […],"James Uthmeier visits the Dade-Collier Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport with two Florida Highway Patrol troopers, ahead of construction of an immigrant detention facility, via screengrab from his X account.The Key West City Commission’s vote last week to reverse itself and agree to once again enter into a 287(g) agreement with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) came in response to a threat made by Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier that failure to do so could lead to their removal from office.
But several critics of the agreement told members of the commission in public comment prior to their vote that they should defer any action, saying they were under no legal obligation to authorize the Key West Police Department to work with ICE.
“287(g) agreements are not mandatory in this state,” said Berbeth Foster, senior staff attorney with Community Justice Project, a Miami racial justice and human rights organization.
“Key West and any city in the state of Florida does not have an obligation to enter into this agreement. So instead, what we’re seeing is the governor and the attorney general using fear and intimidation to force cities across the state to engage in conduct that far exceeds Florida state law requirements.”
After Key West commissioners voted to void the previously agreed-upon contract with ICE on June 30, Uthmeier declared in a social media post: “Key West has made itself a sanctuary city,” which are illegal in Florida. He went on to warn that failure to take corrective action would result in the enforcement of “all applicable civil and criminal penalties, including removal of office by the Governor pursuant to section 908.107, Florida Statutes, and the Florida Constitution.”
Uthmeier also threatened members of the Fort Myers City Council with removal earlier this year after they opposed having their police department from cooperate with ICE. Like Key West officials, they promptly turned around and voted to implement a 287(g) agreement.
Cites are not required to sign 287(g) agreements in Florida
However, in dozens of Florida cities, police have not entered into 287(g) agreements. ICE has links on their website showing the number of participating law enforcement agencies in Florida and the U.S. with such agreements, although it is not completely up to date.Among those that have signed on but are not yet listed on the website is Miami, which enacted its agreement with ICE last month.
Alana Greer is director and co-founder of the Community Justice Project in Miami.
“Despite the tremendous pressure exerted by the governor and AG to strong-arm cities into joining ICE’s deportation machine, over 100 agencies have not signed up,” she told the Phoenix. “No federal or state law requires they join. But that legal truth is not enough, we need courage from elected officials to hold the line for their communities.”
Florida banned sanctuary cities in 2019. The law defines a sanctuary policy as “a law, policy, practice, procedure, or custom adopted or allowed by a state entity or local government entity which prohibits or impedes a law enforcement agency from complying with 8 U.S.C. s. 1373 or which prohibits or impedes a law enforcement agency from communicating or cooperating with a federal immigration agency …”
(8 U.S.C. s. 1373 is  a federal statute that prohibits local and state governments and agencies from enacting laws or policies that limit communication with DHS about “information regarding the immigration or citizenship status” of individuals).
Section 908.104 of the law says that “[c]onsistent with all duties created in state and federal law, state and local law enforcement agencies and any official responsible for directing or supervising such agency shall use best efforts to support the enforcement of federal immigration law.”
Another city in Miami-Dade — South Miami — is involved in a lawsuit against the Ron DeSantis administration regarding the legal requirements for municipalities to participate in such agreements. The city seeks a declaration that not executing a 287(g) agreement does not constitute adopting or having in effect a sanctuary policy.
“The fact that the Legislature required county-level agencies to enter into 287(g) agreements shows that it knew how to enact that requirement if it wanted to,” reads the lawsuit, which was filed on March 27.
“As compelled by applicable interpretive canons … the Legislature’s express specification that a failure to enter into a 287(g) agreement by only operators of county facilities can constitute a sanctuary policy, while failing to make any mention or requirement of municipalities, shows a contrary intention as to municipalities.”
South Miami Mayor Javier Fernández says the purpose of the lawsuit is to allow cities “to have an honest conversation without the fear of retribution and without duress.” It’s important, he said, to talk about implications of such agreements from monetary, liability, and policing perspectives.
“Right now, cities aren’t free to have those conversations without running afoul of what is a very vague statute,” he told the Phoenix last week.
Fernández adds that while he was disappointed Key West City Commissioners opted to execute a 287(g) agreement, he hopes that, if the Second Judicial Court rules in favor of his city, “other cities can weigh the choice Key West was forced to consider without fear and free of duress.”
Who is required by Florida law to work with ICE?
Among the multiple immigration bills filed in the first special session that Gov. DeSantis called for in January was a measure by Hernando County Republican Sen. Blaise Ingoglia (SB 14-A) directing that along with each state and county law enforcement agency, “any other law enforcement agency with more than 25 sworn officers or certified law enforcement officers” must enter into agreements with ICE.
However, that particular bill never made it to the floor — it died once House Speaker Daniel Perez and Senate President Ben Albritton immediately gaveled out of that special session.
“That bill language was never reconsidered in the course of any subsequent session,” Fernández said.
What did make it into statute this year was Statute 908.11, which says that the “sheriff or chief correctional officer operating a county detention facility must enter into a written agreement with the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement to participate in the immigration program under s 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. s 1357.”
It’s not clear what the attorney general’s opinion is of the Florida cities whose police departments haven’t signed a 287(g) agreement. His office did not return a request for comment.

(Getty Images)Hoosiers seeking abortions now face another legal barrier following a June Texas ruling — a decision that blocked a Biden administration reproductive privacy rule nationwide. 
“This is another legal blow to reproductive privacy and health care privacy for women, and I’m really concerned,” said Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis.
  Rep. Carey Hamilton, D-Indianapolis, speaks during a news conference on Monday, Jan. 8, 2024. (Leslie Bonilla Muñiz/Indiana Capital Chronicle)
She worries Attorney General Todd Rokita, who has hailed the ruling, will take advantage of it.
The issue started in 2024 when health officials under former President Joe Biden enacted the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act privacy rule to boost protections and  block law enforcement from getting medical records of patients seeking legal abortions or gender-affirming care. 
In June, a federal judge in Texas overturned that rule, finding the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services acted unlawfully when expanding the HIPAA privacy law. 
States Newsroom reported that, without the rule, law enforcement officials in states with abortion bans may issue subpoenas for records related to reproductive health care obtained legally in another state. According to health policy nonprofit KFF, 22 states and the District of Columbia have laws limiting what reproductive health information can be obtained — but others, like Indiana, don’t.
Some states have already attempted to track abortion seekers. 
According to the Associated Press, a suburban Chicago police department allegedly shared data from automatic license-plate readers with a Texas sheriff seeking a woman who had an abortion. The Illinois secretary of state is investigating the police department. 
“Since Roe (v. Wade) was overturned, patients are rightfully afraid that if their state bans abortion, it may attempt to target or prosecute them for obtaining an abortion in other states. Anticipating this situation, the recently vacated rule enhanced health care data privacy protections against disclosure to law enforcement,” said Amy Myrick, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights. “While HIPAA still provides basic protections for your health care data, this openly anti-abortion ruling is yet another blow against the basic freedom to make decisions about your own body and health care.”
Abortion in Indiana 
An Indiana Department of Health report released in April showed a total of 146 abortions occurred in 2024 – a 98% decrease from 2022. 
Indiana’s near-total abortion ban, which took effect in August 2023, outlaws abortion except in cases of fatal fetal anomalies and serious health risks to the mother. Victims of rape or incest are also allowed to access abortion care up to 10 weeks post-fertilization. The law mandates that hospitals perform all abortions. While performing an illegal abortion is a felony for doctors in Indiana, women seeking abortions face no criminal penalties. 
FDA-approved abortion pills remain accessible by mail nationwide. 
Indiana law also requires that providers who perform abortions file terminated pregnancy reports with the state health agency. They’re due within 30 days if the patient is 16 or older, and within three days if younger than 16. Each of the reports should include demographic, medical and procedural information. 
In January, Indiana Gov. Mike Braun signed new executive orders on abortion records to ensure the laws are “fully and faithfully executed,” including for terminated pregnancy report submissions. It also required a new IDOH state report, recommended financial penalties for noncompliant hospitals and greater state oversight by health officials. 
Hoosiers traveling to seek care
Illinois — which has protected abortion access as a fundamental right — is a top destination for Hoosiers seeking the procedures. Since Indiana’s abortion ban went into effect, there has been a five-fold increase in patients traveling to Illinois, according to Planned Parenthood of Illinois.
At Planned Parenthood’s Carbondale Health Center, 90% of patients seen are from another state. 
In 2024, 9,500 Indiana residents traveled to nearby states to obtain abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion-rights research and policy group. Principal Federal Policy Adviser Anna Bernstein said the 2024 rule from the Biden administration strengthened privacy protections for patients seeking reproductive health care. 










“Indiana residents are already being denied abortion care in their state — vacating this rule will likely only mean more infringements on their bodily autonomy.”


– Don't forget to add author


“By vacating this rule, Judge (Matthew) Kacsmaryk has removed critical protections for patients seeking abortion care at a time when criminalization of patients and providers is increasing. The 2024 rule prohibited the use and disclosure of protected health information for care that was lawfully provided,” Bernstein said. “Without this rule, patients like those traveling out of state for care could be at greater risk for law enforcement involvement for seeking necessary health care.”
State lawmaker Hamilton said that, as legal rulings come down, doctors fear providing life saving care to women who are pregnant. And as doctors see health care and reproductive deserts grow in Indiana, she feared that women will struggle even more to find emergency care when something goes wrong during pregnancy. 
Indiana University Associate Professor of Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology Dr. Caroline Rouse said she is concerned about the erosion of reproductive health care privacy laws and thinks it’s important for everyone to spread awareness. She said that a doctor-patient relationship is critical. 
  Dr. Caroline Rouse, medical director of maternity services and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at IU Health (From Indiana University School of Medicine’s website)
“I am very concerned about patients suffering consequences of that and concerned about patients not even seeking the care that they need and suffering the consequences of not getting that care,” she said.
OBGYN Dr. Amy Caldwell said current Indiana law does not give the attorney general grounds to demand records from neighboring states. 
“The intent of overturning laws like this is to scare women,” she said. “Physicians will never turn over a patient’s record unless there is a court order and patients should always feel empowered to access their records.” 
Rokita, meanwhile, has celebrated the ruling and how it impacts Indiana reporting. 
That’s because several doctors performing abortions in Indiana have refused to file terminated pregnancy reports since the federal rule went into effect. Litigation is ongoing. 
“We’re moving forward with our goal to protect life and working to undo the many setbacks created by the Biden administration,” Rokita said in a statement. “We’ve been closely watching the Texas case and updated the Indiana court of the decision there, so we look forward to having a positive outcome in our case. This is a major win for women and for physicians because it would take away an excuse thrown up by abortionists for not complying with state law.

Tom Cotton and Democrat Hallie Shoffner are seeking to represent Arkansas in the U.S. Senate during the 2026 election. (Courtesy photos)Sixth-generation farmer Hallie Shoffner officially launched her campaign against U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton on Tuesday. 
The Democrat and Newport native is challenging the incumbent Republican who’s seeking his third six-year term in the U.S. Senate during the 2026 election. 
Shoffner aims to unseat Cotton and “take on the corrupt political system he’s spent the past ten years rigging against regular people,” according to a press release. 
“As a sixth-generation family farmer, I know what it’s like to have to fight tooth and nail for everything you have, and still get crushed by an economy that’s rigged against you,” Shoffner said.
Noting that Cotton has twice voted against the Farm Bill, Shoffner said she’ll fight for a Farm Bill that gives farmers “room to breathe.” She also argued that Cotton’s tax cuts are for “land barons,” and said the Republican “just blew a massive hole in our national debt.” 
All six members of Arkansas’ federal delegation, including Cotton, voted in favor of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which will make permanent 2017 tax cuts and provide billions to carry out the president’s plans to crack down on immigration and increase defense spending. The bill could add $3.4 trillion to deficits over the next decade, according to estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.   
“I’ll cut taxes for blue-collar workers, fight to restore Medicaid, save Social Security, cut the deficit, and be radically focused on bringing costs down for regular people,” Shoffner said. “I’ll fight this rigged system every day—Tom Cotton’s the guy who did the rigging.”
Shoffner is a graduate of Newport High School, Vanderbilt University and the Clinton School of Public Service. In addition to running her family farm, she is also the founder and CEO of Delta Harvest, which builds local food infrastructure, supports farmers and brings opportunities back to struggling communities, according to the release. 
Shoffner grew up on her family farm in East Arkansas where she started working in the field with her dad at the age of 10. In February, she and her family decided to sell their 2,000-acre farm due to high input costs and inadequate federal assistance, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported. 
“It doesn’t matter if you are a farmer, an auto mechanic, or a single mom taking on a double shift just to make it, if you have to work for a living, you know how hard it is to get by when your own Senator is working against you,” said Shoffner. “I’m not a politician, I’m not much for political parties, and I’ve never run for office in my life—the only thing I ever wanted to do was farm. But if I can’t farm, I’m going to fight.”


Let us know what you think...


 

Cotton officially announced his re-election campaign on Feb. 27, when he asked for support to continue his work “as the conservative voice” for Arkansans. In a campaign video, Cotton acknowledged “times have been tough these last four years.”
“Runaway inflation has pushed Arkansas families to the edge. Prices are too high and paychecks are too small,” he said. “Our southern border was left wide open, our country flooded with more than 10 million illegals, dangerous criminals and deadly drugs.”
With President Donald Trump in the White House and Republicans holding a slim majority in both chambers of Congress, Cotton said “we can turn things around for Arkansas and our nation.” 
“Let’s secure our border, deport criminal illegal aliens and stop the drug traffickers,” he said. “Let’s end wasteful liberal spending, cut your taxes and get inflation under control. Let’s rebuild our military, crackdown on China, stop Iran from getting nukes and always stand with Israel.”
Cotton was born and raised on his family’s cattle farm in Yell County, according to his campaign website. The sixth-generation Arkansan graduated from Dardanelle High School before going to Harvard University and Harvard Law School. 
The Arkansas Republican left law school because of the September 11th attacks and served nearly five years on active duty in the United States Army, according to his Senate website. Cotton completed combat tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. His military decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, Combat Infantry Badge and Ranger Tab. 
Cotton was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2014. Arkansas’ junior senator is chairman of the Intelligence Committee and the third-ranking member in the Senate Republican leadership as chairman of the Senate Republican Conference. 
In his campaign launch video, Cotton promised to “never back down” as an Arkansas congressman. 
“Together we’ll make Arkansas and our nation stronger and safer,” he said. “So let’s go forward together — strong, confident and resolute. In the defense of our glorious past and our limitless future.”    
All members of Arkansas’ congressional delegation and Republican Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders endorsed Cotton in February. Trump also endorsed him earlier this month. 
Cotton has about $8.6 million in his campaign fund, according to the Federal Election Commission. Shoffner’s campaign hasn’t had to file a campaign finance report yet.

A new federal law that would “defund” Planned Parenthood could gut the system people have used to obtain abortions since the fall of Roe v. Wade, disproportionately closing the clinics in states that have become abortion havens for people living under bans.
Backed by President Donald Trump, the spending law prohibits reproductive health clinics from billing services to Medicaid if they provide or are part of health networks that perform abortions, are nonprofits and receive over $800,000 per year from the federal government. Although that part of the law is blocked for now, Planned Parenthood is gearing up for major financial losses that, unless new funds emerge, could shutter health centers across the country, particularly in states where abortion is legal and Medicaid programs more robust.
The move has been framed by politicians across the spectrum, anti-abortion activists and reproductive health providers alike, as an effort to eliminate a major source of funding for Planned Parenthood, specifically. Abortion opponents have claimed this “defunding” as their biggest victory since the 2022 Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and end federal abortion rights.
Currently, about one-third of all of Planned Parenthood’s revenue comes from federal and state funding; Medicaid, the health insurance program for low-income Americans, is the biggest single source. Medicaid insures 1 in 5 Americans, and it does not cover abortion unless states allot their own specific funds to do so. But the program remains a major source of income for Planned Parenthood because it covers other services patients might get at clinics such as testing for sexually transmitted infections, breast exams and contraception. If clinics can’t bill any of those services to Medicaid, patients covered through the program will have to go elsewhere for health care — or simply go without.
A federal judge in Massachusetts blocked that part of the law after a legal challenge by Planned Parenthood, which argued it violates the U.S. Constitution’s free speech and due process protections. A hearing in the case will take place later this month. But across the country, Planned Parenthood representatives expressed worry that this relief is temporary at best. Many clinics have already stopped accepting Medicaid. Others are continuing to see patients covered by the program, but refraining from submitting those insurance claims for payment. All are making contingency plans in case they are unable to reenter the Medicaid program.
Many are scrambling to find alternative sources of revenue to stay afloat. Clinics are particularly vulnerable in places where abortion is legal and Medicaid programs receive more state investment. In many of those states — such as Colorado, Maryland, New Mexico and New York — abortion clinics have seen a dramatic influx in out-of-state patients since the fall of Roe. Clinic closures in those places could force patients to travel even farther for abortions, get care later in pregnancy or drive up what patients have to pay. It could also mean more people stay pregnant.
“This just feels like this could be another huge shock to the system,” said Caitlin Myers, an economist at Middlebury College who has tracked abortion-related travel patterns over the past three years.
Last year alone, 155,000 people traveled to another state for an abortion, according to the Guttmacher Institute, a nonpartisan research organization. About 1 in 4 abortion patients in Colorado came from another state. In New Mexico, it was 69 percent. More than 7,000 patients traveled to New York, the fourth-largest state by population, for an abortion last year. Thousands more made the journey to Maryland.
Clinic closures would likely create new challenges for those patients, including longer waits and more expensive journeys to find abortions.
“In a lot of states that have received a lot of people traveling from out of state that have become critical, there really is a strain on clinic capacity,” said Isaac Maddow-Zimet, a data scientist at Guttmacher who tracks abortion-related travel patterns. “Clinics have learned to scale up capacity to serve those patients. If there were a significant number of clinic closures, it would really have an impact on people’s ability to get in-person care.”
That’s a looming possibility in New York, where the Planned Parenthood affiliate with 23 health centers could lose about $35 million in federal Medicaid dollars. That’s about a third of the $103 million in operating revenue it reported last year.
Organization leaders are hoping the state government could step in — but if not, most of the affiliate’s clinics could shut down, said Robin Chappelle Golston, who heads Planned Parenthood Empire State Acts, the organization’s advocacy arm. That wouldn’t just affect New Yorkers, she said. Clinics in the state see patients from numerous other states, including hundreds from Texas and thousands from Florida last year.
“It’s just going to make it harder for people to get the care they need. We will have to reduce services and put a burden on other providers,” she said. “You clog up the whole system, where people aren’t able to get care in the time they need it.”
Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountain, which operates clinics in New Mexico and Colorado, is already turning away patients covered by Medicaid. Medicaid covers about a fourth of their patients in each state.
“Planned Parenthood Rocky Mountain has been around for over 100 years. We’re not going to go away,” said Jack Teter, the organization’s vice president of government affairs. “We need our state legislatures to step in.”
In the immediate future, he said, the organization may actually have more availability to see out-of-state abortion patients: there are slots now that would otherwise have gone to people covered by Medicaid, who can no longer get treatment. But he wouldn’t say if the organization might have to scale back if New Mexico and Colorado, which are both fully governed by Democrats, don’t or can’t replace those federal funds.
“These are safe haven states with strong reproductive health care access supporting trifecta governments. If they can’t find 3 or 4 million dollars to replace the loss of federal funding, that’s embarrassing,” he said.
While it’s still not clear how many clinics might close across the country, the consequences could be vast, making the journeys patients must make  to travel for care — already hundreds or in some cases thousands of miles — too arduous to complete. With that, more people may be forced to stay pregnant.
One study, published this June in the American Journal of Public Health, found that the average travel time for an abortion after states began putting near-total bans in place jumped from 2.8 hours to 11.3. And 17 percent of people traveling for an abortion had their procedure at 13 weeks of pregnancy or later, compared to only 8 percent before the end of Roe, a development the researchers attributed to the greater challenges they faced in finding care.
Already, patients crossing state lines for care have had to navigate increasing delays in getting abortions, in part because traveling hundreds of miles for an appointment involves logistics: finding child care, taking time off work or raising the funds necessary to finance a trip.
Planned Parenthood Illinois, which receives about $4 million per year in Medicaid funds, does not immediately anticipate many of its clinics closing, said Tonya Tucker, the organization’s interim CEO. But, she added, clinic closures in other states could mean even more patients traveling to Illinois —  resulting in longer wait times and care that comes later in pregnancy, thus costing more. Already, abortion providers there saw more than 35,000 out-of-state patients last year.
“We have an expectation that people may have to travel farther distances, and how we prepare for that is really important,” said Megan Jeyifo, who runs the Chicago Abortion Fund, one of the largest such funds in the country. “If the safety net is going to continue to shrink in this country and people have less resources, that will mean our costs go up.”
In Illinois, she said, abortion providers and reproductive rights activists are brainstorming ways to undercut potential clinic losses. That could mean expanding the capacity of independent clinics, which already provide a large share of abortions, recruiting more health care providers or leaning on options such as telehealth, which does not require travel and is far cheaper than in-clinic abortion. About 1 in 4 abortions are already performed through telehealth, with half of abortion provided for people who live in states with bans and who receive abortion pills from providers in other states.
But building out those alternatives will require time and resources. Separate from their efforts to cut funding for physical clinics, abortion opponents have been pressing for federal restrictions on abortion medication, including a national ban on telehealth.
“As people’s options get more and more constrained you never know what that one additional obstacle is going to be that says someone is not able to obtain an abortion,” Maddow-Zimet said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_6694-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 07:05:31.842807

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
 The feds pull back

Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.

Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
 Disaster declarations

In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

Federal fallout

	
As federal funding and systems dwindle, states are left to decide how and
whether to make up the difference.
Read the latest > 


Wisconsin Attorney General Josh Kaul joined 23 states and the District of Columbia Monday in suing the Trump administration for withholding $6.8 billion meant for six U.S. Department of Education programs, which help support English language learners, migrants, low-income children, adult learners and others. 
The funds, approved in the Full-Year Continuing Appropriations and Extensions Act 2025 and signed into law on March 15, are typically distributed to states by July 1. However, the Department of Education notified the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction as well as other state education agencies on June 30 that they would be withholding the funds. 
“Depriving our schools of critical resources is bad for our schools, bad for students, and bad for Wisconsin,” Attorney General Josh Kaul said in a statement. “This unlawful funding freeze should be stopped.”
The Wisconsin DPI said in a statement that the federal agency gave no specific explanation for the action. Instead, the U.S. Department of Education said that “decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming academic year” and “accordingly, the Department will not be issuing Grant Award Notifications obligating funds for these programs on July 1 prior to completing that review. The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.” 
The withholding of funds comes as the Trump administration continues to pursue closing the Department of Education with a plan to lay off more than 1,000 agency employees and resume drastically cutting the agency after getting the greenlight from the U.S. Supreme Court Monday. The Trump administration has also withheld other funds this year, including for grants for mental health in schools. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget said in a statement about the review of education funding that “initial findings have shown that many of these grant programs have been grossly misused to subsidize a radical leftwing agenda.” 
The multi-state lawsuit argues that the freeze of the $6.8 billion violates federal laws and regulations that authorize and fund the programs, federal laws, including the Antideficiency Act and Impoundment Control Act, that govern the federal budgeting process and the constitutional separation of powers doctrine and the Presentment Clause. 
The coalition of states is requesting that the court provide declaratory relief by finding the freeze is unlawful and offer injunctive relief by requiring the release of the funds. 
Over $72 million is being withheld from Wisconsin. Without the funding, school districts face funding shortfalls for programs that have already been planned, DPI may have to lay off 20 employees and programs at Wisconsin’s technical colleges are in trouble with $7.5 million in adult education grants being withheld.
State Superintendent Jill Underly said in a statement that Wisconsin schools depend on the federal funding distributed through an array of programs to support students. There are five programs affected: Title I-C, which supports migrant education, Title II-A, which goes towards teacher training and retention, Title III-A, which supports education of English language learners, Title IV-A, which is for student enrichment and after-school programs and Title IV-B, which supports community learning centers.
“Make no mistake, stopping this money has had and will continue to harm our families and communities,” Underly said. 
Wisconsin schools have received funding through these federal programs for decades to help carry out related programs. According to DPI, federal funding makes up about 8% of funding for Wisconsin schools with nearly $850 million coming into the state. 
Sen. Tammy Baldwin alongside 31 other U.S. senators penned a letter to Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought and Education Secretary Linda McMahon, calling on them to release the money. 
“This delay not only undermines effective state and local planning for using these funds to address student needs consistent with federal education law, which often takes place months before these funds become available, but also flies in the face of the nation’s education laws which confers state and local educational agency discretion on permissible uses of federal formula grant funds,” the senators wrote. “We are shocked by the continued lack of respect for states and local schools evidenced by this latest action by the administration.”
“It is unacceptable that the administration is picking and choosing what parts of the appropriations law to follow, and you must immediately implement the entire law as Congress intended and as the oaths you swore require you to do,” the lawmakers said. 
The lawmakers also said the “review” being undertaken by the administration appears to be intentional to delay the funding and will result in budget cuts for schools. They said it is happening “with no public information about what the review entails, what data the administration is examining or a timeline for such review.”

An email message from the agency about the tax cut bill that President Donald Trump signed July 4 has drawn sharp criticism. (Photo by Michael Vi/Getty Images)Retired professor Larry White says the email message he got on July 4 from the Social Security Administration was unlike any he’s ever seen from the agency.
“The Social Security Administration (SSA) is celebrating the passage of the One Big, Beautiful Bill,” the email message began — using the official name of the massive legislation signed by President Donald Trump that cuts taxes and also slashes spending on Medicaid and SNAP, along with making numerous other policy changes.
White, 71, who lives in Middleton, Wisconsin, has been getting Social Security Administration email since he retired from the Beloit College psychology faculty in 2019. But until the July 4 message, he said, every single one has been straightforward, factual — and nonpolitical.
The message included a misleading description of one provision in the new law. The Social Security Administration later published a correction.
That alone angered White. But that the message was sent at all was just as irritating, he told the Wisconsin Examiner.
The email, including a quote from Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano, “appeared to value currying favor with the president over telling Americans the truth,” White said. “I want our federal agencies to be independent, nonpartisan offices that act with integrity and serve the public, not the president.”
The Social Security message claims that the legislation “ensures that nearly 90% of Social Security beneficiaries will no longer pay federal income taxes on their benefits…”
“This is a historic step forward for America’s seniors,” Social Security Commissioner Frank Bisignano stated.
  A screenshot of the Social Security Administration message sent to the agency’s email list early July 4, 2025.
As was soon widely reported, however, the message itself was off the mark.
“I was surprised to see SSA send this out as an email to such a large list since this seems more about politics than anything specific to the program,” said J. Michael Collins, a household economics expert at the University of Wisconsin. Collins directed a Social Security research center at the UW until the Trump administration shut it down earlier this year.
The actual change that the message refers to is to income taxes paid by all people 65 or older with incomes $75,000 a year or less for single filers and $150,000 a year or less for couples — regardless of whether they’re collecting Social Security or not, Collins explained.
While the message appears to single out Social Security income, “there is no new exemption of SSA income from federal income taxes, just a new deduction for all people 65+ regardless of income source,” Collins told the Wisconsin Examiner in an email message.
For people who are 64 or younger and who get income from Social Security, there’s no comparable tax cut, he added.
To be sure, the reduction does give some help to taxpayers 65 or older who collect Social Security.
 A 2022 IRS tax tip explains that half of Social Security income is taxable for  a single person whose income is $25,000 to $34,000 and for a married couple filing jointly whose income is $32,000 to $44,000.
For a single person with income over $34,000 or a married couple with income over $44,000, 85% of their Social Security income is taxable.
Social Security beneficiaries with incomes below the $75,000 or $150,000 ceiling will get relief from those tax bills — along with everyone else 65 or older whose income also falls below those limits.
The tax break also lasts just a few years, ending in 2028 — stretching the claim that qualifying beneficiaries “will no longer” pay income taxes.
The email message produced a sharp blowback.
“I was appalled — it was really unprecedented,” Nancy Altman, president of the advocacy group Social Security Works, told the Wisconsin Examiner in a phone interview. “They’ve taken an agency that’s supposed to be above politics and made it an arm of propaganda.”
Altman recalled that when Social Security checks were mailed in October 1972, President Richard Nixon suggested including an insert in which he could take credit for a benefit increase — even though he had initially opposed it. The commissioner at the time, Robert Ball, threatened to resign if Nixon followed through, and Nixon backed off, Altman said.
As originally worded, the email message appeared to suggest two separate tax cut provisions — one for Social Security recipients 65 and older and one for others:
“The new law includes a provision that eliminates federal income taxes on Social Security benefits for most beneficiaries, providing relief to individuals and couples. Additionally, it provides an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older, ensuring that retirees can keep more of what they have earned.”
On July 7, the Social Security Administration added a correction and changed the second sentence in that paragraph to, “It does so by providing an enhanced deduction for taxpayers aged 65 and older…”
The correction was previously reported by HuffPost reporter Arthur Delaney.
The morning that he received the Social Security message, White, the retired Beloit professor, wrote back to Bisignano directly — guessing at a direct email address for the Trump-appointed Social Security Commissioner.
“Commissioner Bisignano, When did the Social Security Administration become so blatantly political? I thought government agencies like the USPS were supposed to just go about their business from one administration to the next, but clearly that’s not the case with the SSA. You have become an unabashed mouthpiece for Trump. Shame on you!”
“I was upset that the head of a major federal agency would act in a way that undermines the public’s trust,” White told the Wisconsin Examiner.
“For years, Trump has expressed contempt for America’s once-revered institutions — courts, universities, the press, medical experts, climate scientists, long-time allies abroad … the list is a long one,” White added. “Trump wants to diminish any group or individual who questions his aims or methods.”
The email message appears to play directly to that characteristic of the president, he said, and White fears that will diminish the agency in the public eye.
“What upsets me is that the commissioner of the SSA foolishly wrote a letter that will prompt millions of Americans to question the integrity of the SSA,” White said. “It takes years for an organization to build up a good reputation, but it can be fatally damaged almost overnight.”

In June, a six-person jury will decide whether a political action committee defamed two Republican legislators in campaign materials. 
The post Jury trial dates set in Wyoming Freedom Caucus PAC defamation case appeared first on WyoFile .","One year after two Sweetwater County lawmakers filed a defamation suit against a Wyoming Freedom Caucus-affiliated political action committee, a jury trial has been scheduled in the case.  
In June, a six-person jury will decide whether WY Freedom PAC defamed Rock Springs Republican Reps. J.T. Larson and Cody Wylie when it sent text messages and mailers to voters calling a vote on a 2024 budget amendment a vote to remove former President Donald Trump from the presidential ballot. 
The PAC launched in 2023 to support the hard-line Wyoming Freedom Caucus, which won control of the Wyoming House in November. Among the PAC’s targets were Rock Springs Republicans Larson and Wylie. In their complaint, the two lawmakers allege that the PAC knew its statements were false and, therefore, made them with actual malice — a legal standard in defamation cases involving public figures or officials. 
While the two lawmakers ultimately fended off Freedom Caucus-backed challengers in the primary election, they argue in the complaint that the PAC’s statements were especially damaging in a conservative state like Wyoming, where “support for Trump is so strong … that whether one supports Trump has become a proxy for whether a person is a true Republican.”
Attorneys for the PAC, meanwhile, have accused Wylie and Larson of “seeking to punish and censor criticism of their records as legislators and to profit from their public services.”
The PAC also argues that the mailers and text messages do not constitute defamation and “were made in the course of political campaigning, where imaginative expressions and hyperbole are at their zenith.” 
Outside of legal proceedings, Freedom Caucus lawmakers have defended the mailers, calling the complaint “lawfare.” 
The lawsuit, filed in July 2024, included a request for a jury trial, which is scheduled to span five days starting on June 15, 2026, according to a scheduling order by District Court Judge Richard L. Lavery.

How we got here
The Wyoming Legislature has never in its history considered, debated, nor voted on any proposal to remove President Donald Trump from the ballot in any election, in any state. 
Campaign mailers and text messages stating otherwise referred to a vote on a budget bill footnote, WY Freedom PAC Chairman Kari Drost previously told WyoFile. 
In recent years, lawmakers have regularly clashed over which elected officials should have the authority to represent the state’s interest in litigation. The debate reignited in the 2024 budget session after Secretary of State Chuck Gray joined Ohio and Missouri’s Republican secretaries of state in filing an amicus brief that advocated overturning a Colorado court’s decision to remove Trump from that state’s ballot because of his role in inciting the Jan. 6, 2021 riots at the U.S. Capitol. 
The Joint Appropriations Committee responded by adding a footnote to the budget limiting the secretary of state’s ability to sue on Wyoming’s behalf. 
“No funds shall be appropriated under this section shall be expended without specific legislative authorization for the secretary of state or the office of the secretary of state to initiate any litigation or participate in any litigation initiated in a court outside of Wyoming in which the state, the secretary of state or the office of the secretary of state is not a named party,” the proposed language read. 
The footnote was motivated by protecting the separation of powers and ensuring the governor — the state’s chief executive — remained the one office with the authority to speak on behalf of Wyoming in a courtroom, some lawmakers argued. That included Clark Stith, who lost his reelection bid in August and is now counsel for Larson and Wylie. 
Freedom Caucus members, however, argued that Gray’s office needed the ability to act quickly. The footnote was ultimately left out of the final budget bill passed by both chambers, but was portrayed by the PAC’s mailers as a vote for or against Trump being on the ballot. 
“[He] voted with the RADICAL LEFT to remove President Trump from the ballot,” a postcard targeting Wylie stated. A similar mailer aimed at Larson accused him of voting “NO to KEEP President Trump on the ballot this fail.” 
What now?
In March, Judge Lavery ruled that the case could continue, rejecting a motion to dismiss the matter entirely, according to reporting by the Rocket Miner. 
“Defendant did not merely misrepresent Plaintiffs’ views or fail to state the whole truth. Defendant fabricated a putative ‘vote’ on an issue that never came before the Legislature and placed it in a list of votes on other topics of legislation,” the ruling stated.
Lavery did, however, dismiss plaintiff’s “false light” claim, which is a more obscure privacy law than defamation. It deals with communications placing someone in a false light, among other things.  
From here, both parties will begin preparing for trial via a formal process known as discovery, which involves exchanging information about witnesses and evidence.

(Photo courtesy of Getty Images)The Idaho Public Safety Communications Commission on July 10 approved a $15 million grant to modernize the state’s emergency response system. 
The money will go toward moving Idaho’s decades-old analog 911 infrastructure to a secure, digital network called Next Generation 911, according to a press release from the Office of Emergency Management. 
“We are proud to have been part of the process in developing a strategy to bring Next Generation 911 to Idaho,” Commission Chairman and Payette County Sheriff Andy Creech said in the release. “This transition will save lives and strengthen the connection between 911 callers and our law enforcement, fire and EMS teams. It’s a major step forward in ensuring every Idahoan has access to fast, reliable emergency response.”
Idaho EMS moves to state military division, under new law

The more-advanced system will allow dispatch centers to receive real-time mobile location data, text messages, photos, videos, and live call transcription, the release said. The system would also include the technology and connectivity needed to route calls based on an exact location, including specific rooms in large buildings. 
The system, called NG911, is built to handle call surges during disasters, the release said. 
The grant will go toward a phased implementation to bring online the 42 of Idaho’s 44 counties that are participating in the grant program. Idaho Public Safety Communications Commission 911 Program Manager Eric Newman told the Idaho Capital Sun that the implementation should take about 18 months. 
The funding comes through the Emergency Communications Grant Fee, a 25-cent surcharge on phone bills. 
The commission also approved a $1.33 million grant to support Geographic Information System projects in communities across Idaho to help integrate with NG911. The funds will help create a four-person team to work directly with counties throughout the state, including the 32 that do not have a GIS professional on staff, the release said. 
The commission and the Idaho Office of Emergency Management “will work closely with counties and emergency response partners to support implementation, training, and public education throughout the rollout process.”

Why not fight for every federal dollar Wyoming can get to help ease the state's K-12 burden, columnist Kerry Drake asks.
The post Trump administration withholding school funding angers districts but not Degenfelder appeared first on WyoFile .","On July 1, the U.S. Department of Education didn’t give Wyoming nearly $25 million in congressionally approved federal funds, which left all 48 school districts in the state scrambling to find money to pay teachers, run programs and buy instructional materials that were already budgeted.

Opinion

But the chaos caused by President Donald Trump’s administration doesn’t seem to have Superintendent of Public Instruction Megan Degenfelder the least bit concerned. Her acceptance of the situation proves she’s a loyal foot soldier in the president’s campaign to abolish the federal Department of Education, but it shouldn’t put her on an automatic path to reelection.
“While we do not yet know the details of this review of funds, President Trump’s education priorities are Wyoming’s priorities, and I continue to support his leadership,” Degenfelder said in a statement to the Wyoming Tribune Eagle.
Degenfelder’s belief that we should accept whatever Trump says is good for Wyoming — even if it’s nothing — isn’t leadership, it’s just political posturing. And we do know many of the details about how these funds were snatched away from states last minute under the guise of a “review,” and how their loss will impact students and educators.
For starters, the $25 million for Wyoming — part of the national $6.2 billion for five educational grant programs — was already in the budget Trump signed. All states will be impacted by this decision. Not delivering those funds and ignoring the will of Congress is a travesty, another blatant attempt by the president to skirt the rules.
States will be expected to find their own funding for grant programs to support professional development of teachers, English learners, academic enrichment and student after-school and summer programs.


These are all successful long-term programs that won congressional approval because they have the backing of educators, parents and communities.
If Degenfelder truly does not realize the impact of this funding loss, especially to the state’s rural schools, she should study several sources that explain it in detail. One is the education policy group New America, which noted red states that have heavily supported Trump are actually more negatively impacted than blue states.
“The loss of these funds will significantly impact school communities, and the impact will be much greater on students and families in certain school districts — particularly high-need districts, often in Republican-leaning areas,” New America concluded.
Of the 100 school districts that would see the most drastic losses per pupil, 91 are heavily concentrated in Republican-represented congressional districts. School districts with high poverty rates above 25% will lose more than five times as much per pupil as low-poverty districts. Districts with a majority of students of color will see 50% bigger cuts than majority-white school districts.
Wyoming has two school districts in the top 100 that stand to lose the most in per-pupil funding if the federal money continues to be withheld for the 2025 fall semester.
One is Fremont County School District 38 in Arapahoe on the Wind River Indian Reservation. It has a 25.5% poverty rate, with 98% students of color. The second is rural Big Horn County School District 4 in Basin.
Why isn’t Degenfelder on the phone with the White House, demanding to know why students at two Wyoming school districts are on a list with 98 others that aren’t being treated fairly by the feds?
Another area of concern for Wyoming is the threat posed to after-school programs like the Boys and Girls Clubs of America, which have 35 chapters operating in Wyoming. The national group’s CEO, Jim Clark, told Axios more than 900 clubs could be forced to shut their doors, and club sites and camps “could shutter mid-season — upending care for working parents and leaving kids without critical safety nets.”
Wyoming has myriad K-12 public school funding woes, including a projected $686 million deficit in the School Foundation Program by the 2029-30 biennium, huge residential property tax breaks that will harm education and a court decision that the state is unconstitutionally underfunding schools. Wyoming voters need confidence that state and federal dollars for education are being wisely spent.
A superintendent of public instruction should fight tooth and nail to make sure Wyoming receives the $24.5 million that school districts were told by the feds was coming. It’s unacceptable to simply act like, because we’re an ultra-red state, we have to bow to Trump’s decision, especially if it means all of that funding goes away. 
Degenfelder has acted like a major part of her job is to compliment Trump at every turn. It’s not what we elected her for. 
What are we to make of Degenfelder putting out a press release on Jan. 20, congratulating Trump on his inauguration?
“Wyoming is ready to partner with his administration to fight for families, protect parental rights, and empower the next generation,” said Degenfelder. “Under President Trump’s leadership, we’re confident America will continue to embrace bold ideas and strong values. Congratulations, Mr. President — Wyoming stands with you!”
In March, as part of her “official duties,” Degenfelder went to the White House to watch Trump sign his executive order to abolish the U.S. Department of Education.
“This restructuring will make sure that funding reaches our classrooms,
benefiting students and educators first, instead of being absorbed by the
bureaucratic layers in Washington, D.C.,” she told the Casper Star-Tribune.
We know Degenfelder can do more than kiss the ring of the Republican president. The last time I recall she really got worked up, it was to announce she’d rejected $2.2 million a year in USDA funds for a program to ensure poor students could eat when they were out of school in the summer.
“I will not let the Biden administration weaponize summer school lunch programs to justify a new welfare program,” she said. “Thanks, but no thanks. We will continue to combat childhood hunger the Wyoming way.”
Arguing against feeding kids because it’s “welfare” was the nadir of Degenfelder’s first term. Still, maybe she could learn from that embarrassing experience and fight for a good cause, like not backing down until the Trump administration explains why it’s short-changing poor school districts in Arapahoe and Basin, and gives Wyoming all the money it promised.

Tony Evers participated in closed-door negotiations to come up with  the 2025-27 state budget.

[…],"As federal aid ran out, advocates called on lawmakers to fund the Child Care Counts program using state dollars, as Evers proposed. (Baylor Spears | Wisconsin Examiner)This summer Democratic  and Republican legislators along with the Gov. Tony Evers participated in closed-door negotiations to come up with  the 2025-27 state budget. All of the  parties involved are touting the budget as a historic advance for children and patting themselves on the back for compromising with each other and the work they accomplished. In other words, they played well in the sandbox together. While yes, the state budget has never included funding for child care in its history, as we were one of only six states that didn’t, crowing about it now is kind of like touting the fact that you’ve just changed a diaper for the first time when your child is 2 years old. It’s not something to brag about, and the new state  budget is nothing to  brag about either.  
On the surface, as you read the claims about historic investments in child care and K-12 schools, you might think the budget really solved some big problems. Take Evers’ statement celebrating “Over $330 million to support Wisconsin’s child care industry and help lower child care costs for working families, a third of which is in direct payments to providers.” That means only $110 million is to continue the direct investment to all 4,700 eligible regulated child care programs. The original amount for this program was $480 million. Child care is receiving less than 25% of the requested amount. You might have  surmised from Evers’ victorious statement that parents will see a decrease in tuition costs with the new budget. However, the opposite is going to be occurring, and tuition increases will start in August. The $110 million will cause child care rates to increase next month because the new state investment  is less than a third of what Child Care Counts, funded through the American Rescue Plan Act, originally provided. 
The purpose of that money was to stabilize a field that had been declining for decades. It  increased teachers’ wages while holding down tuition costs for parents. It worked. The data showed a decline in closures and it raised the average child care educator’s wage from $11 an hour to $13 an hour in Wisconsin. (In our state, over 50% of early child care teachers have some college education or degree, with an average of 10 years experience.)
This month the ARPA funds run out, and for the past few years, knowing the federal funding would be ending, families, child care providers, and businesses have been advocating for the state to fill the gap and to subsidize child care. We know that for every $1 a state invests in early childhood education, the rate of return is between $10-$16.  Not only does quality early child care give children an opportunity for greater success as adults, it also supports our workforce, families and the economy. 
Regardless of the research and well-being of children, the gatekeepers of our tax dollars on the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee deleted Evers’ $480 million direct state investment budget request for child care. Instead, child care funding was determined behind closed doors with Senate Minority Leader Diane Hesselbein and Evers in one corner and Rep. Vos and Senate Majority Leader Devin Lemahieu in the other. It should be noted that no one in that  space is considered an expert in child care policy. What came out of this room was a compromise for the sake of compromise.  
The $110 million for child care won’t come from state dollars. It’s the interest that has accrued on the federal ARPA funds. It will be allocated directly to child care providers over the next 11 months, until June of 2026. It comes to about 70% less than the original amount paid through  CCC. This is why, starting in August, there will be significant closures of child care centers and home daycares in rural areas of the state — already considered a child care desert. Tuition will increase at the child care operations that try to stay open. So no, working families will not “see a decrease in childcare costs” as stated by Evers.  
And when the $110 million ends next year, there is nothing to replace it. The Wisconsin Legislature will gavel out in March and not gavel in until January of 2027, as legislators will be campaigning the rest of 2026. There won’t be an opportunity to pass emergency legislation  funding child care. Rates will increase again and closures will continue. 
The remainder of the $330 million in child care funding in the new state budget is for several new programs. A $66 million state investment for 4-year-olds to access “school readiness” in their child care program. This will help parents as the state will pay for their “preschool” time, but it replaces tuition for part of the school day. Child care programs that have school districts with all-day, free 4K will likely find it almost impossible to compete with public schools when they still need to charge for the remainder of the day plus wrap-around care. 
In addition, there is a $28 million pilot project to deregulate the child care field, which ends in July 2027. This move comes directly from the Republicans’ playbook. The pilot project will incentivize providers to increase their ratios, meaning more children per teacher, lower quality and safety for children and more stress on teachers. 
Another harmful policy in the new budget is that 16-year-olds are now allowed to be assistant teachers and count as adults in the ratio. Coupled with the pilot project mentioned above, this means a classroom of 14 toddlers can be supervised by one 18-year-old and one 16-year-old. This reduces the quality, safety, care and education for the children in our programs. Recall that while these decisions were being made behind closed doors, there were no experts in child care policy in the room. This policy was made without consideration of our state accreditation program, YoungStar, and our national accreditations. Any program that participates in the pilot project will no longer qualify to be accredited. And in Wisconsin, accreditation is not just a certificate to state you are following high safety standards, but our YoungStar program is tethered to our Wisconsin Shares (subsidy for child care). Programs with a five or four-star rating receive a bonus subsidy rate. It can mean a considerable loss of funding for providers to participate in the new pilot project.  
The politicians who wrote the budget deal behind closed doors neglected to consider the increased cost or loss of insurance for providers when we increase the teacher-to-child ratio and when we allow 16-year-olds to count as adults. 
The same group of non-experts also decided to allow policies that, in 2023, were already proposed and had failed to become law due to the overwhelming outcry from families, providers and the medical field against a policy that reduces quality and safety for our children. The state is  throwing millions of dollars in the garbage for these policies, which won’t benefit child care programs and will cause actual harm to Wisconsin children. 
Enacting policies like these without holding hearings raises the question: Who is representing us? The public already overwhelmingly said no to these policies two years ago. Furthermore, funding for child care is one of the top priorities that the JFC heard from voters throughout the state at budget listening sessions. Surveys show that the majority of both Republican and Democratic constituents support funding early child care. The only real compromise made in this budget was the compromise of safety and quality of our youngest children in the state.
Wisconsin’s K-12 budget
So how did school-age children fare in the state budget? Again, we are reading about record-setting investments in schools, along with the biggest investment our state has ever made for children with disabilities. Evers proclaimed that the new budget  “secures the largest increase to special education reimbursement rate in state history.”  You might think, great, finally children with disabilities will receive the support and resources they need. But you would be wrong. Evers’ budget request was for a 90% reimbursement for children with disabilities. After all, 90% reimbursement is the amount that Wisconsin voucher and charter schools have already been receiving for children with special needs. Unfortunately, the new budget allows public schools a maximum of 42% in 2026 and 45% in 2027 reimbursement, which is a far cry from the 90% request or from the 60% rate of the 1980s. Yes, the increase in this budget is technically the largest increase in recent years, but it is still miles away from the finish line. 
To make matters worse, the budget also provided a $0 per-pupil increase in general aid funding to public schools; however, a provision was placed in the budget paperwork that guaranteed voucher and charter schools would receive additional funding for their general aid in the budget. I can’t recall a year when no new general funding was provided in a budget to public schools in Wisconsin. Last year Wisconsin saw a record number of public schools go to referendum to squeeze additional funding from their communities to compensate for the lack of state and federal funding. Under the new budget, we will see another record number of schools going to referendum next year. We will also likely see more schools close, specifically in rural, poorer areas where the communities cannot be squeezed any more than they already have been. As you can imagine, this budget will only continue to widen the education gap in quality between the wealthy and the poor.  
Not to be all doom and gloom, there was one category of children that fared quite well with the new budget: our juvenile offenders. The budget will invest $1 million per juvenile offender. Yes, $1 million per kid. Remember when it was mentioned that investing in our youth early on saves us tenfold later on? The children in our juvenile justice systems are children who were not given the opportunity for quality early child care, children who were raised in poverty, children who have been abused, children who experience trauma, children with mental health issues. 
The children in our juvenile systems are those who have been failed by our state. Their families could not afford child care, so they were shuffled from one person to another. They lived with violence and addiction in their homes. And when they got to school at age 5, they were already on a trajectory of despair; the school systems cannot afford to provide all the services and support these children need, especially for those who have suffered trauma at an early age. 
Our new state budget only prioritizes these children once they are ready to be locked away. 
Unfortunately the hype about Wisconsin making record investments in our children is terribly overblown. Instead, the truth of the matter is that we are putting in the minimum, and this budget keeps us on the lowest tier as a state for investment in our public schools and our young children compared to other states. Meanwhile, we continue to be among the biggest spenders  on our juvenile offenders. 
Our political leaders have misled us.
I don’t think most Wisconsinites care whether their representatives can compromise or not. I think we would all rather have elected politicians who will actually represent us with integrity.  Represent us with values that prioritize our children, families, workforce and our economy. This is our common humanity. We can stop generational poverty. We can stop children from going hungry, we can support children who have been abused and neglected, and we can give children a chance in life. But we just made the choice not to do that.

(Quentin Young/Colorado Newsline)Colorado state leaders and Democratic lawmakers warned of the budgetary impacts from the federal tax break and spending cut bill in the months leading up to its passage, saying it will devastate the state’s Medicaid program, drastically reduce nutritional assistance for families and blow a hole in the budget that the state can not absorb.
The bill, signed by President Donald Trump on July 4, includes trillions of dollars of tax cuts, temporary tax deductions for overtime and tipped income and about $170 billion for increased immigrant detention and deportations.
It also slashes spending for social safety net programs like Medicaid and food stamps — programs that are a cost share between states and the federal government — and rolls back Biden-era clean energy tax incentives.
Now that the bill is law, Colorado leaders are parsing the language to better understand the fallout. It could reduce state revenue by hundreds of millions of dollars per year.

One state lawmaker who helps write the budget says state leaders have no more room to trim around the margins and predicts they will be forced to make cuts in core areas of spending.
“We will have to see to what extent we need changes in our law to be responsive to what we’re seeing coming in that bill. And each of the different agencies (are) going through that bill now trying to figure out exactly the answer to that question,” Rep. Shannon Bird, a Westminster Democrat who sits on the Joint Budget Committee, said.
The goal is to figure out what needs to be addressed now — potentially through a special legislative session or when the Legislature reconvenes next January — and what can wait.
“Governor Polis has been open about the sad reality that the state can’t make up for the funding that President Trump and Republicans are taking away from Coloradans,” Polis spokesperson Shelby Wieman wrote in an email. “The governor has previously indicated we may need to reconvene the General Assembly to deal with the terrible impacts from the bill, and we are still reviewing the impacts of this new law to evaluate next steps, including a potential special session.”
Many of the law’s provisions around Medicaid, such as increased eligibility checks, new work requirements and changes in the provider tax rules, do not go into effect for more than a year. But state officials predict they will need to hire thousands more employees to implement the new bureaucratic processes.
The Kaiser Family Foundation predicts that federal spending on Medicaid in Colorado will drop between $11 billion and $18 billion over the next decade.
In a post to X on Monday, the House Republican caucus rejected the claim that the federal bill has unnecessary cuts to Medicaid.
“The so-called cuts refer to a change in how much the federal government contributes. It does not mean a reduction in the quality of care or access to Medicaid,” the post says. “If the state reprioritized its spending, it could easily fill the gap left by a smaller federal match while avoiding any impact on patients.”
Democrats in the state Legislature control strong majorities in the House and Senate.
The Colorado Fiscal Institute estimates that the Medicaid cuts will cost the state about $660 million, based just on the tally of people who may lose coverage, and not other administrative costs.
“I think it’s really hard for people to see this really big bill and understand that it is not going to immediately have an impact, but when it does, it’s going to be really terrible,” said Caroline Nutter, CFI’s legislative and policy manager.










There will be cuts to real services that people expect.


– Rep. Shannon Bird, member of the Colorado Joint Budget Committee


This year, lawmakers worked to craft and pass a state budget that made up a $1.2 billion hole, largely caused by ballooning costs for Medicaid and other state programs, as well as slowing inflation. They paused or eliminated new programs, shifted spending timelines for transportation projects and restricted new spending. The next budget, which will face the same issues as this year’s compounded with the federal spending bill impact, will be much more difficult to write.
“There will be cuts to real services that people expect,” Bird said. “A lot of what we were able to cut last year were programs that I wouldn’t say were the most crucial for people getting mental health care or access to regular health care. I think that this round of cuts this year will be cutting into key programs that people actually depend upon.”
Bird said there are no obvious places in the state budget to cut.
“If you cut (the Department of) Corrections, that could be devastating. If you cut the courts, then that’s people’s access to justice. That would be devastating. If you cut child welfare, that’s hurting kids,” she said. “But these are the questions we’re going to have to be addressing. And these are the cuts I don’t want to make.”
TABOR limitations
Sen. Barbara Kirkmeyer, a Brighton Republican who also sits on the JBC, said that Colorado’s budgetary challenges predate the federal bill.
“The problem is that Democrat lawmakers and the Governor have been on a spending spree for years with hardworking Coloradans required to pay the bill,” she said. “My strategy remains the same: to protect and fund critical priorities such as health care, public safety and education. In the short term, it’s time to ground the kids and take away the credit cards. In the long term, we need to get a clear understanding of what (the bill) does, instead of just attempting to scare people to death.”
Joshua Mantell, director of government affairs at the left-leaning Bell Policy Center, said there is “very little margin” for the state to pick up costs of federal cuts. He attributed this to the limitations of the Colorado Taxpayer’s Bill of Rights, a constitutional amendment that requires the government to return money to taxpayers when revenue exceeds a cap determined by inflation and population growth and mandates voter approval for new taxes.
“Unlike other states, which have the ability to balance tax revenue and spending, we only have one lever that we can push in Colorado, and that is to cut spending,” Mantell said.
Mantell suggested that lawmakers should consider changing the tax code in Colorado to increase taxes on the wealthy, better situating the state budget. But he added that TABOR limits most revenue-increasing steps that can be taken.
“We really need to be thinking about whether we need to ask the wealthy to pay a little bit more in taxes to be able to manage these cuts that are coming in, and ensure that Colorado is not being dictated to by the federal government and the Trump administration on what to do,” Mantell said. “We need to be able to chart our own path for the people in this state.”

(Amelia Ferrell Knisely | West Virginia Watch)A new Family Treatment Court launched in Cabell County on Monday with the goal of helping parents in child abuse and neglect cases get help for their substance use disorder then safely reunify with their children.
West Virginia’s foster care system is overwhelmed, and most children enter the system due to abuse and neglect and parental substance abuse. 
“Children are separated from their parents. Parents struggle to find the way back, and too often, this cycle repeats,” said Sixth Circuit Judge Sean “Corky” Hammers, who volunteered to preside over the Family Treatment Court.
“But today in Cabell County, we say enough. The Family Treatment Court is here to break that cycle,” he continued. “Keep in mind, this court is not about punishment. It’s about rebuilding.”
The voluntary Family Treatment Court Program offers 24/7 support for parents as they navigate recovery and work towards reunification with their children in the foster care system. It includes intensive case management, parenting services, housing referral assistance and more for a period of typically nine months with continued support.
“It takes strength to admit they need help, and determination to stay the course,” Hammers said. “This court will support that journey every step of the way, with treatment, accountability, guidance and grace.”
Cabell County — previously referred to as “ground zero of the state’s opioid epidemic” — has West Virginia’s second highest number of child abuse and neglect cases.
Cabell Family Treatment Court coordinator Clarissa Mills-Pyles said, “Cabell County needs the services of a Family Treatment Court,” said 
It’s the 14th Family Treatment Court in West Virginia. The courts, which serve 18 counties, have served 635 parents and 887 removed children. They have graduated 280 participants so far, with 418 children reunified with their families.
Children in child abuse and neglect cases typically spend around 18 months in West Virginia foster care; the family treatment programs reduce that time to a little more than 10 months. Twelve percent of the children have re-entered foster care within two years. 
Parents in the Family Treatment Court undergo frequent court monitoring, substance use testing and counseling while participating in the program.
“This program is intense and will be hard work, but these participants will have a full team behind them,” Mills-Pyles said.
The program in the Sixth Judicial Circuit is a cooperative effort of the court, Child Protective Services, substance use disorder treatment providers, Court Appointed Special Advocates (CASA) and others. 
Musician and comedian Cledus T. Judd, who is in recovery for substance use disorder, attended the opening ceremony at the Cabell County Courthouse in Huntington. While Judd did not attend a specialized treatment court, he said he hoped to inspire participants that recovery is possible.
“My love for my child was my recovery,” Judd said. “It’s not a child’s job to save a parent’s life, but it’s a parent’s job to save a child’s life … You can become something, because I did.”
As a result of the foster care crisis, West Virginia’s courts — from circuit courts all the way to the state Supreme Court of Appeals — are inundated by child abuse and cases and appeals. The state’s ongoing shortage of CPS workers has also impacted the court system, causing delays in cases and finding children a permanent home.
The Family Treatment Court often moves the cases along faster, leading to quicker permanency for children in the foster care system. Hammers noted that it was also saving the state money.
According to the state Supreme Court of Appeals, West Virginia has saved $7 million in foster care or kinship subsidy payments through Family Treatment Courts.
The programs have been funded through grant dollars, most commonly from federal grants and McKesson Corporation opioid settlement funds administered by the West Virginia Office of Drug Control Policy. Family Treatment Courts cost around $85,000-$100,000 per year to operate.

(Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)Is Idaho about to fall off the fiscal cliff due to irresponsible budgeting?
No. The Gem State’s current budget has a decent ending fund balance, substantial budget reserves on hand, and many important fiscal tools available should the economic outlook for the state and country change.
Unfortunately, there’s a false narrative going around that Gov. Brad Little’s prudent use of budget planning tools means the state is on the wrong path.
Here are the current details for the state’s budget framework:

2026 adopted spending: $5.62 billion 
Ending fund balance: $345 million (6.2%)
Unrestricted general fund reserves: $880 million (14.8%)
Total reserves: $1.307 billion (22.1%)

Due to a softening of the forecasted revenue growth, the Division of Financial Management sent a memo to state agencies on May 29 requesting they identify potential spending “holdbacks.”
From the memo: “Governor Little will prioritize critical investments in essential areas while ensuring a conservative and balanced budget for Idaho . . . We are asking all state agencies to internally prepare 2%, 4%, and 6% budget holdback scenarios to have in place as we continue to watch economic trends at the national level. This exercise not only helps us be prepared for uncertainty but also allows agencies to look internally at priorities and operations and ensure critical operations are prioritized.”
I recently had the opportunity to talk with Idaho’s Division of Financial Management Administrator Lori Wolff about the state’s budget outlook. She expressed confidence in the budget balance sheet and told me that the governor’s request for agencies to identify possible spending holdbacks isn’t all related to changing revenue growth projections.
  Division of Financial Managment Administrator Lori Wolff answers questions from reporters at a press conference before the annual State of the State address on Jan. 6, 2025, at the Statehouse in Boise. (Pat Sutphin for the Idaho Capital Sun)
“Sometimes holdbacks are not due to revenue but to reduce future spending pressures,” she said.
Some have interpreted the May memo to claim that lawmakers were irresponsible to prioritize tax relief or invest in the new education choice tax credit (House Bill 93) this year. Instead, it shows the governor is taking advantage of a rational budget management tool to provide options if the economic outlook deteriorates in the future.
Remember, revenues are still growing, and there is a $345 million ending fund balance for fiscal year 2025 and $880 million in unrestricted reserves ($1.3 billion in total reserves).
It is because of the state’s strong fiscal management that Fitch recently reaffirmed its top AAA credit rating for Idaho. Fitch noted: “Fitch believes the state is well positioned to absorb multiple rounds of recent tax cuts and dedicated spending allocations from the general fund, given Idaho’s prudently managed budget with significant one-time spending that rolls off to create fiscal capacity.”
Should the economic outlook deteriorate significantly, however, Gov. Little has the option of using the aforementioned holdbacks, budget reserves, or a combination of the two. Realizing that a 10% reserve is considered healthy, Idaho has significant capacity to draw from its nearly 15% unrestricted savings account (22% in total reserves) if needed, without imperiling its budget stability.
As Administrator Wolff noted in June: “Idaho also has 22% of general fund revenues in rainy day funds, greater than almost every other state. While we continue to watch revenue closely, we feel good about the strength of the state budget and our economy.”
State of Idaho ends 2025 fiscal year with approximately $345M ending balance

A July 11 press release from Gov. Little highlighted this positive economic growth for Idaho: “Withholding collections – reflecting job and wage growth – are up 5.9% over last year. Gross sales tax revenues are up 3.7%, and online sales tax collections are tracking 13.2% above last year. Idaho’s GDP has grown 150% in the last five years. Adjusting for inflation, Idaho’s real GDP is up more than 21% in the past five years alone, demonstrating exponential, resilient growth. In addition, Idaho ranks third in the nation for the largest increase in average weekly wages.”
Just to illustrate how prudent Idaho’s budget balance sheet is, let’s compare it with our neighbors in Washington state. Despite imposing the largest tax increase in state history this year, the Evergreen State has only a fraction of the budget discipline Idaho has demonstrated. For example:

Washington’s ending funding balance is only $33 million (or 0.04%) compared to Idaho’s $345 million (or 6.2%).
Washington’s total budget reserves are only 2.7% compared to Idaho’s 22%.

There is no denying that there are economic headwinds facing state budgets across the country, driven primarily by unpredictable fiscal policy at the federal level. The good news for Idaho is that the state’s balance sheet is sound, with a 6.2% ending fund, more than a billion dollars in total reserves, and state revenues are still projected to grow overall.

Republican U.S. Rep. John Rose is reporting more than $6.1 million in fundraising for Tennessee’s 2026 gubernatorial race, calling it an “unprecedented start” for the campaign, though most comes from a personal loan.
The state’s former commissioner of agriculture announced he raised $1.1 million from hundreds of supporters in all 95 of Tennessee’s counties and made an initial loan of $5 million to his campaign after announcing his candidacy in March.
“To receive this level of support in just a few short months from my fellow Tennesseans is huge for our campaign and my mission to protect our shared values,” Rose said in a release. “This is more than just a fundraising number — it’s a clear signal that voters want to defend this state and our freedoms just as badly as I do.”
The Cookeville resident who owns a family farm in rural Temperance Hall put together most of his wealth through an online information technology company he founded in 2000. He is now owner and president of Boson Software.
Campaign chairman Chris Devaney called the initial fundraising total an “unprecedented start” that puts Rose in a “commanding position.” Rose’s campaign had not filed a report with the Tennessee Registry of Election Finance as of Monday.
While Rose’s campaign touts what it calls the largest first filing in Tennessee gubernatorial history, the 2018 Tennessee Republican gubernatorial primary was expensive as well. 
By the end of the campaign, the five candidates — Gov. Bill Lee, University of Tennessee President Randy Boyd, former U.S. Rep. Diane Black, former House Speaker Beth Harwell and former state Sen. Mae Beavers — had spent almost $50 million. 
In the first two months of his initial campaign, Lee raised $1.4 million and loaned his campaign nearly $1.4 million for a total of $2.8 million. Lee, who is wrapping up his second four-year term, still has outstanding loans of $4.58 million.
Boyd, in the first four months of his campaign, raised $4.4 million, about half of which was a personal donation of $2 million. 
U.S. Sen. Marsha Blackburn is expected to enter the Republican primary in the governor’s race but hasn’t made an announcement.
Memphis City Council member Jerri Green said last week she will run in the Democratic primary for the governor’s seat.

One of the primary drinking water sources for the region, the river has high nitrate levels that have led to water restrictions for some 600,000 customers. (Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
 The role of agriculture

As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.


Central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels.


Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
 Citizen action

The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walton League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.










I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.


– Northeast Iowa retired science teacher Birgitta Meade


While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
 Small towns struggle

Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

FEMA announced Monday that Carroll, Houston and Wayne counties are now eligible for public assistance funding, which helps reimburse some local government costs for debris removal and repairs to public infrastructure or facilities.
Local governments and some nonprofit organizations affected by severe storms, straight-line winds, tornadoes and flooding in April can now apply for assistance. 
The counties join a cadre of other Tennessee counties approved for public assistance in June, including: Cheatham, Davidson, Decatur, Dyer, Fayette, Gibson, Grundy, Hardeman, Hardin, Haywood, Henry, Hickman, Lauderdale, Madison, McNairy, Obion, Perry, Stewart and Tipton counties.
Private nonprofit organizations that provide “non-critical services of a governmental nature” — including food kitchens, homeless shelters, museums, libraries, community centers and schools — may also be eligible to apply for low-interest federal disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration.
These loans include business physical disaster loans of up to $2 million to repair or replace buildings, equipment or inventory damaged in the disaster. Economic Injury Disaster Loans can be used for capital needs caused by the disaster, even if the business was not physically damaged.
Businesses and private nonprofits in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties can apply for both types of loans. 
Businesses and nonprofits in adjacent counties — including Cannon, Chester, Crockett, Dekalb, Fayette, Gibson, Hardin, Haywood, Hickman, Houston, Humphreys, Lake, Lauderdale, Madison, Robertson, Rutherford, Smith, Stewart, Sumner, Trousdale, Weakley and Williamson — can apply only for Economic Injury Disaster Loans, according to the SBA.
Homeowners and renters may also be eligible to apply for loans of up to $100,000 to replace or repair vehicles, clothing, furniture, cars and appliances. Homeowners can apply for loans of up to $500,000 to replace or repair their primary residence, according to the SBA.
The deadline for homeowners and renters in Cheatham, Davidson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties to apply for FEMA assistance is Aug. 19.
Individual assistance dispersals reach $3M and counting
President Donald Trump’s administration also approved individual assistance for people affected by the storms in Cheatham, Davidson, Dickson, Dyer, Hardeman, McNairy, Montgomery, Obion and Wilson counties.
Eligible applicants can receive individual grants for temporary housing and home repairs, support services, and low-cost loans for uninsured losses (FEMA doesn’t cover losses already covered by insurance). 
FEMA has approved 438 applications for individual assistance totaling $3.4 million as of July 14. That includes roughly $1.8 million in housing assistance and about $1.6 million in other assistance, according to FEMA’s website.
FEMA recommends affected individuals file a claim with their insurance company immediately, before applying for FEMA aid.
Affected individuals can apply for individual assistance through DisasterAssistance.gov, through FEMA’s mobile app or by calling 800-621-3362. Help with applications is also available at Disaster Recovery Centers set up in each eligible county. Centers offer assistance information from FEMA and the U.S. Small Business Administration. All centers are closed on July 4. Hours for each center as well as additional resources can be found at fema.gov/disaster/4878.

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

(Photo: Getty Images)As a former Metro Nashville Public School teacher, I know firsthand what it is like when children do not get enough time to play.
I still remember my days as a middle school teacher, watching students’ attention spans (and attitudes) deteriorate after hours of sitting in class. The attitudes and attention spans would drastically improve after they came back in from playing. It seemed like a reset button had been pressed. 
That’s why Tennessee’s new bipartisan recess law, which requires 40 minutes of daily unstructured play for K-5 students, is such a victory for our children.
This unstructured time, which the law prioritizes to be taken outside, will truly be beneficial to our Tennessee students. This is a change from the current law, which states that elementary schools must have 130 minutes of recess a week. After revising the original bill from 60 minutes a day to 40 minutes a day, the law was approved by every legislator except one. 
As someone who studies the cognitive development of young children, I am extremely happy about this bill. The benefits range far beyond just offering more time for students to run around; it will also give them the time they need to develop self-regulation, a crucial life skill that will pay dividends far beyond elementary school.
Self-regulation is the ability to manage one’s thoughts, feelings, and actions. It’s what helps a child stick with a tough math problem instead of giving up. It’s what allows them to calm down when a friend hurts their feelings.
Research shows that children with strong self-regulation skills do better academically and have better mental health. While children begin developing this skill prior to kindergarten, the elementary school years are crucial. In fact, a child’s self-regulation in elementary school has been linked to reduced unemployment, mental health concerns, and criminal behavior 30 years later. 
This brings me back to the playground, the kingdom of movement and play. On any given day, it’s where you will see self-regulation in action. When playing freeze tag, a child must stop and no longer run until they are unfrozen. That ability to freeze and follow the rules teaches them impulse control. When playing four-square with others, they learn cooperation and conflict resolution. Self-regulation in children shows up as not having a tantrum after being eliminated and cheering on their friends from the sidelines instead. This shift is connected directly to play and is why recess is such an important component of early childhood education. 
Tennessee’s extended recess is thanks to dedicated parents in Clarksville who first pushed their local school district to expand recess and then decided to head to the state to make a change to benefit all students. 
As parents, they saw firsthand the need for play in their children. They formed the “Say YES to RECESS Tennessee” group to help advocate for more recess across the state. With the passage of the bill, they are already hearing some struggles with schools that have to make changes to a packed daily schedule. Rachel Bush, with the group, says, “We’re not talking about cutting math and reading in half, but really just looking at shaving a little bit here and there to increase recess to then help every other subject in the classroom.”
The group succeeded where teachers have struggled since No Child Left Behind — the law intended to improve education, particularly for students from disadvantaged backgrounds — slashed recess time in 2002. For two decades, we’ve prioritized test scores over play, and our children have paid the price. 
Teachers are speaking out on the behavioral issues that are happening in schools across the country. Many of these issues stem from poor self-regulation — kids who never learned to manage their impulses through play. There’s a chance that this recess bill could shift the state’s focus back to teaching the whole child. As children play more this upcoming school year, I hope legislators are looking for more ways to include play within the school day.
How can parents and community members continue to support extended recess and integration of play-based learning? Contact your school board members to ask for more play in school. Support teachers who incorporate play into lessons. And most importantly, celebrate when your child comes home tired and happy from a full day of learning and playing. It’s good for their health — and yours.

The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
 Musk says America Party will focus on a select few U.S. Senate, House seats

Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

 Unite America executive director: Open primaries could improve political representation in elections

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

At one point, one of the volunteer guides caught an interesting looking individual in his net and held it aloft for the crowd of 30 or so firefly hikers to see. They peppered him with questions. 
One asked why the firefly was blinking so furiously. 
“Desperation,” the guide said. 
This firefly was quickly released to rejoin the dazzling light show among the trees, but over the last few years there’s been increasing concern about a decline in the iconic insect that is a staple of summers in Kentucky and beyond. 
Recent viral social media posts claiming that current generations might be the last to see fireflies have stirred nostalgia and, in some commenters, their own resigned desperation. 
Is it really too late to save the firefly? 
Those who research and follow the populations in Kentucky say no. Still, evidence of a decline is there, and rarer firefly species are especially at risk. 
‘How many species do you want to lose?’
Information on the severity of the overall decline is hard to come by, and experts say that’s due to a lack of data. Data on the rarest strains of the about 2,400 firefly species in the world is even more elusive. 
Darin McNeil, an assistant professor of wildlife ecology and management at the University of Kentucky, participated in a study released last year that endeavored to draw conclusions based on the limited anecdotal data that is available. 
The study found a number of threats could be linked to shrinking firefly numbers, including impervious ground cover like sidewalks, roads and buildings. 
But McNeil said the larger than expected impact of weather and climate on the populations of fireflies in any given location was of particular interest. 
“We have to generalize a bit here because we don’t have data on individual species of fireflies,” McNeil said. “So fireflies in the eastern United States as a broad group, seem to really like cool, moist places.” 
If an area sees changes in overall weather patterns, it could see a decrease or increase in common fireflies depending on the temperature and moisture, McNeil said. 
But not all firefly species might be able to move and adapt.

While it doesn’t seem that most common firefly species are in danger of completely disappearing anytime soon, there are a number of more rare species that are at risk. They’re species that the general public might not ever notice being gone, and it’s likely there wouldn’t be a significant ecological impact in losing them, McNeil said. 
“But the thing is, how many species do you want to lose?” McNeil said. “And at a certain point you’re going to start losing so many species that the ecosystem will eventually collapse.” 
The disappearance of one rare firefly species could be an indicator of conditions that could lead to other species going extinct. 
“So I would argue that while, yeah, probably the ecosystem can function without the blue ghost firefly, it serves as a canary in the coal mine for broader ecological issues,” McNeil said.
The blue ghost firefly, a rare species known to be primarily in Southern Appalachia, was spotted at the recent Firefly Friday event at Bernheim. Behind the scenes, researchers at the privately owned forest are taking a closer look at the peculiar insect. 
The blue ghost
The fireflies most Kentuckians are likely familiar with are known for their rapidly blinking yellow-tone glow. 
The blue ghost firefly has a comparatively dim blue glow that is constant for up to 60 seconds at a time. The males also only fly about a foot off the ground.
The females can’t fly at all, which combines with the species’ low numbers to make them especially vulnerable to threats. 
“They’re stuck on the ground, so when companies come through and they clear the land of trees to build apartments or business, you know, offices, whatever that they’re working on, they’re destroying that land and those fireflies are incapable of just moving to a new patch of forest because they can’t move that quickly,” said Kathleen Kerr, a volunteer naturalist at Bernheim who helped lead the recent hike. 
At least 15 species of firefly are known to be in Kentucky, and 13 of those can be found at Bernheim in Bullitt County about 25 miles south of Louisville.

Kelly Vowels, research coordinator for Bernheim Forest and Arboretum, is heading up a collaboration between Bernheim and a lab at the University of Georgia. Two grad students there are looking into two groups of fireflies — one being the rare blue ghost.
The aim of the research is to use genetics to determine the relationship between blue ghost fireflies across their range in the southeastern United States.
A deeper understanding of the species will help with conservation efforts, Vowels said. 
Bernheim’s Firefly Friday events hope to bring some of that deeper understanding to the general public. 
“When you see something in person and you learn to love it and care about it, you’ll take care of it and protect it in the future,” said Lynette Cox, director of marketing and communications at Bernheim. 
‘Feels like magic’
Bernheim’s firefly hikes take place on Friday nights during the best season to see fireflies – late spring into early summer.
“One of the most important things about these events is that it allows people to engage in what feels like magic,” said Jonathan Shirley, one of Bernheim’s volunteer naturalists. “These fireflies, they tie so deeply to our childhood for most of us.”
The fireflies combined with the song of the whippoorwill and the dark skies free of artificial light allow people to “experience something that you might not have access to anymore at your home,” Shirley said. 
Shirley and the other volunteers enthusiastically led the recent group, the last of the season, lit only occasionally by the less-intrusive glow of red lanterns. The hikers included a wide range of ages, including one child who on multiple occasions exclaimed how cute the fireflies were. 
Whitney Nowicke of Louisville surprised her mom with a trip to Bernheim for a firefly hike. She’d seen the social media posts online claiming that fireflies will disappear. 
“While I think there is some truth to that, I think how everything is online, it’s overly sensationalized to make people be like, ‘oh my god, that’s so sad,’” Nowicke said. “And then, you know, when they’re sitting around having a conversation at a bar or whatever, it’s just a talking point for them, but then they don’t really do anything about it.”
Nowicke said programs like the hike at Bernheim showed that there’s still work that can be done to save fireflies. 
Citizen science and backyard conservation 
At the end of the hike, the volunteers gathered the group on a bridge. In the red lantern light, they spoke over the calls of numerous frogs to tell the group about ways they can help preserve fireflies and other species in their own backyards. 
To simplify, Shirley said they could do the most for native species by doing less. Less manicuring of lawns, less nighttime illumination.

In a separate interview, McNeil said that people can also help with the lack of data that has made tracking firefly populations so difficult. The study he participated in at UK relied entirely on data from a project called Firefly Watch, which gathered information through citizen science.
The Firefly Watch project has since changed hands from Mass Audubon to the Xerces Society, but people can still contribute by providing data. 
“You can sign up tonight and submit data from your backyard, or mom’s house or some park up the street, wherever you want, even downtown, and upload data on how many fireflies you’re seeing and some characteristics of that site at the time you’re visiting,” McNeil said. “Even if you see zero, that’s very valuable data.”
McNeil said it’s also a great way to get kids involved and thinking about science. 
Raking leaf litter to the side of your yard instead of getting rid of it is another way to help fireflies, McNeil said. 
Before fireflies become the flying light-bringers we’re familiar with, they spend up to two or three years in a state that looks quite different. And while they’re in that larval state, they need cover like leaf litter to survive. 
‘Tiny little Bengal tigers’
Fireflies have a long lifespan compared to a lot of insects, and only a few weeks of that lifespan are spent flying around and searching for a mate.
After hatching, the firefly will spend up to a few years as a wingless larva that McNeil compared to an “armored grub.” 
And that armored grub is a tiny vicious predator that uses its ability to inject its digestive enzymes to eat things much bigger than itself, including snails and slugs.

“They’re tiny little Bengal tigers,” McNeil said. 
While vicious, fireflies are most vulnerable in that larval state.
So, in instances of singular extreme weather events — like drought, heat waves or flooding — or an overall climate shift or habitat disruption, any change in the number of fireflies we see lighting the night sky might be delayed by a year or two, McNeil said. 
While not as obvious as they are once they start flying, the firefly larvae can still be spotted by observers. McNeil recommends going to a dark park or natural area around April with no flashlight or light source. Once your eyes adjust to the darkness, you can often see the constant glow of the tiny larvae on the ground.
“These animals, they have the ability to glow that is ingrained in every fiber of their being,” McNeil said. 
For now, information on the populations of fireflies remains sparse. Efforts to track them are made more difficult by the fickle nature of the insect, Vowels said. 
“Some nights, they’re all out, and other nights you might miss them, and sometimes they’re early and sometimes they’re late,” Vowels said. “So they’re extremely difficult.”
Still, the efforts will continue. 
“I think now, more than ever, is the time to begin monitoring fireflies so that if there are declines, they’re noticed,” McNeil said.

The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Texas recently approved $50 million for trials of ibogaine's effectiveness  as a treatment for opioid use disorder. (Getty Images)Kentucky shot itself in the foot by passing up a chance to pioneer a promising opioid treatment — an opportunity that Texas recently seized.
But it’s not too late for the General Assembly to make Kentucky part of an effort to study and legalize ibogaine.
Here is the context: In the late 1990s, Kentucky became ground zero in an emerging opioid epidemic initially fueled by prescription drug fraud and doctor/pharmacy shopping, with much of it paid for by government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare as well as private insurance. 
As an early response in 1999, Kentucky created KASPER, a monitoring system designed to track controlled-substance prescriptions. KASPER is used by both health care providers and as an investigative tool for law enforcement to combat the fraud which had crept into the prescribing of pain-killing medications.
Even with this useful tool, opioid consumption swelled, particularly preying on poorer counties and populations, as well as veterans returning from the new combat zones. Eastern and Southeastern Kentucky were particularly overwhelmed. 
New research and treatment options emerged, including medication-assisted treatments such as Suboxone, and began to be widely used. Drug rehabilitation facilities seemed to be everywhere, advertised on every type of media. 
But nothing seemed to be having an effect, and the epidemic continues to this day. The consequences have been disastrous for Kentucky — from overcrowded prisons and county detention centers to increased unemployment and disability rolls to the serious toll on the state budget and economy.
In a positive turn, state attorneys general banded together to file lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies like Purdue Pharma and chain stores with pharmacies like Kroger. This began under then Attorney General Jack Coleman with major settlements under his successors Attorneys General Andy Beshear, Daniel Cameron and Russell Coleman. 
Woodford County partnered with other Kentucky municipalities to join the wave of litigation. This soon led to hundreds of millions of dollars funneled into state, county and city coffers to be used to fight the epidemic.
The Woodford County Agency for Substance Abuse Policy (ASAP) Opioid Task Force was created to receive and administer the local share of funds by developing local programs.

However, the state’s biggest government player is the Kentucky Opioid Abatement Advisory Commission, created by the legislature in 2021 and tasked with making grants from the state’s portion of the $900 million in settlements with opioid manufacturers and distributors, with half of the money going to the state and half going to local governments
The commission has nine voting and two non-voting members, and is housed in the attorney general’s office. 
Cameron was the attorney general who oversaw the first commission and appointed Bryan Hubbard as its executive director. 
Hubbard developed a plan he described as a “moon shot” focused on an emerging treatment protocol using the plant-based hallucinogenic drug ibogaine. 
Ibogaine was successfully being used in two physician-controlled clinics in Mexico and being studied by researchers at Stanford University and top European medical research institutions. 
After months of investigation, consultations with experts as well as meetings with various veteran groups that were focusing on opioid addiction in combat vets, Hubbard met with Cameron and his deputies in the fall of 2021 to present his proposal.
Research and clinical experience demonstrated that administering ibogaine to someone who has addiction eliminates that person’s mental and physical “switch” for the drug and, significantly, eliminates the horrific withdrawal period, which is, more often than not, the formidable barrier to recovery.
Ibogaine alone does not ensure long-term recovery; the person with the addiction still needs the mental health and spiritual support of the recovery process post-withdrawal, but it turns a heretofore rare road to recovery into a wide door of success.
For a state as crippled as Kentucky is by the opioid epidemic, the ibogaine option presented real hope. 
Cameron was persuaded by Hubbard, and $42 million of the initial tranche of opioid settlement funds were dedicated. After months of public hearings across the state, presentations and testimonials from veterans’ groups and science researchers, Hubbard’s proposal was ready to be presented to and approved by the commission. Hubbard, and other supporters expected it to be passed given the makeup of the commission.  
Success would mean funding research, analyzing and working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Congress, partnering with research universities — though the University of Kentucky, via its representative on the commission and lobbying the Beshear administration, fought the initiative — developing trials, and particularly valuable to the state’s treasury, ensuring ownership of patents and other intellectual property. 
After several meetings and scientific presentations, Hubbard gained the support of the Foundation for a Healthy Kentucky, the preeminent Kentucky health policy foundation, and its then-CEO Ben Chandler, a former state attorney general, who testified and lobbied in support of the ibogaine initiative. (Chandler also is publisher of The Woodford Sun.)
Hubbard spoke to Woodford County’s ASAP opioid commission last year. Nancy Blackford, a board member who lost a son to opioid addiction, told me how impressed she was with Hubbard and the promise ibogaine held.
A sure thing? No. There were legal hurdles yet to overcome given that ibogaine is illegal due to its hallucinogenic properties, as well as posing a serious cardiac clinical side effect that is sometimes seen during its use. 
But Kentucky was with open eyes and an investment of $45 million — a modest amount given the total size of the opioid settlements — ready to step forward.
But that did not happen. Instead, Kentucky shot itself in the foot.
At this point, we don’t yet know all the actors and circumstances that led to the decision, but newly elected Attorney General Coleman fired Hubbard and pulled the plug on the ibogaine program. The proposal was rejected by the commission on Jan. 4, 2024, the first meeting with Coleman as attorney general and his appointee Chris Evans, a former chief operating officer for the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, leading the commission. 
In one of his first major decisions as attorney general, Coleman opted for the safe, same ol’, same ol’. 
But the ibogaine initiative did not die. Hubbard created the American Ibogaine Initiative (AII) and partnered with former Texas Gov. and U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry.
Perry became so convinced this was a miracle opportunity that he  testified to the Kentucky commission and helped fundraise and support Hubbard’s new endeavor. 
The two appeared on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast on Jan. 2, 2025, for two hours explaining and discussing the promise of ibogaine as the new frontier for opioid addiction.
In June, the Texas legislature approved $50 million for ibogaine development trials based on the drug’s “extraordinary promise as a breakthrough treatment for substance use disorder, trauma-related conditions, and traumatic brain injury, according to a new release from the Texas legislature. Gov. Greg Abbott signed the bill on June 11. 
Texas will be partnering with two of its major medical schools and research facilities in Austin and Houston on the project.  
Colorado, Ohio, West Virginia and other states are actively seeking to partner with Hubbard and Perry’s AII to develop programs in their states. And U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert Kennedy Jr. recently announced his agency is ramping up government-run clinical studies of hallucinogenic pharmaceuticals to address opioid addiction and other mental illnesses.
“Ibogaine is the Manhattan Project of our time,” Hubbard said after the Texas law was passed. “We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to change the fabric of this country. And mighty Texas, in all its strength and independence, is the first state to stand up and lead a revolution in the treatment of trauma and addiction.” 
Hubbard, who resides in Lexington but was raised in the Central Appalachian region of Virginia, told me a few weeks ago, “What began in Kentucky will return to Kentucky. Not in the timeline or terms we would have wished, but it is my hope and fervent prayer it is coming.” 
According to Hubbard, the legislature could still become part of a coalition of states to accelerate ibogaine’s pharmacological development and ultimate widespread availability by establishing, with an appropriation, drug trial sites in partnership with the drug companies already involved (what Texas is doing). He says Kentucky could still benefit from some intellectual property rights.
Though Hubbard declined to go into details, the cleanest and best path appears to bypass Gov. Beshear and Attorney General Coleman to get the deal done in the legislature during the 2026 session, which is a long one and well suited to this type of issue.
For the rest of us, let’s hope our political leaders don’t shoot the other foot when the ibogaine boat sails back.

Janet Mills unveiled the state's updated climate action plan. (Photo by Eesha Pendharkar/ Maine Morning Star)Environmental advocates secured several key victories in Maine’s latest legislative session, including the establishment of a state energy department and a new clean power goal. But some priority climate bills were voted down or left unresolved until next year.
Still, advocates said there are several policies to celebrate. 
At the beginning of the legislative session, a statewide alliance of 39 conservation, climate action, and public health organizations known as the Environmental Priorities Coalition highlighted its nine priority areas with corresponding legislation for this year. 
In a post-session look back, Maine Conservation Voters, which is part of the coalition, and the Maine Labor Climate Council also highlighted other key pieces of legislation related to labor, climate action and a responsible transition to clean energy.
“The last six months of advocating in Augusta were not without some nail-biting moments and disappointments, but the overall results for people and nature were positive and a testament to the hard work of legislative champions, strong coalitions, and the advocacy and activism of Maine people who care deeply about protecting the Maine we all love,” said Nick Janzen, director of policy and partnerships for Maine Conservation Voters.
Here’s a closer look at the wins, losses and what’s yet to be determined.
Environmental wins 
Lawmakers approved LD 1270, which will transition the current Governor’s Energy Office into a cabinet-level Department of Energy Resources. The new department will oversee the planning and coordination of state energy policy, as well as gain the authority to conduct competitive energy procurements. 
“Maine families and businesses deserve access to energy they can count on and afford — and establishing the Maine Department of Energy Resources is an important step toward an energy future that works for Maine people,” said Gov. Janet Mills after signing the bill into law.
The department is expected to formally launch later this year and will be led by a commissioner appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Legislature. 
Mills also signed LD 1868, which enshrined a goal she set in 2023 of 100% clean electricity by 2040 into law. 
“These bills passed at a moment when the federal government is actively undermining entire clean energy industries and putting skilled tradespeople out of work,” said Francis Eanes, executive director of the Maine Labor Climate Council. “Together, these ambitious bills put Maine on a pathway to energy independence and affordability, and will create thousands of good-paying Maine jobs.”
President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill” signed into law earlier this month phases out clean energy tax credits while making it cheaper to drill and mine for fossil fuels on federal land.  
As the state works toward its clean energy goal, there may also be a new database of clean energy construction projects to identify trends, improve interagency coordination and increase public transparency. Lawmakers passed LD 1850 directing the Governor’s Energy Office to compile such information, but Mills won’t decide on that legislation until January. 
Though opponents saw another bill as an affront to supporters of a 2021 transmission line referendum, some environmental advocates were pleased Mills signed LD 810 into law. They argue it will streamline the approval process for transmission lines that may be necessary for the buildout of clean energy.
Advocates also celebrated passage of LD 1619, which will establish a commission to look into bringing a thermal energy networks program into Maine. Thermal energy networks use shared underground water-filled pipes to more efficiently distribute heating and cooling across buildings or a community.
Priorities voted down 
There were two key climate priorities that lawmakers voted down.
Though it passed in the Senate, LD 1138 didn’t garner enough votes in the House of Representatives. That bill laid out a series of provisions that sought to reduce air pollution from the state’s transportation sector. 
Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in Maine, with most of it coming from personal vehicles. 
Lawmakers in the lower chamber also rejected LD 1940, despite support from the Senate. That bill was seen as a way to ease the administrative burden on municipalities in growth management and comprehensive land use planning.
Bills carried over 
Since lawmakers were juggling a difficult budget season, there were a number of climate-related bills that went unfunded and will be carried over to the next session, which starts in January. 
This includes LD 646, which seeks to study the effects of stormwater pollution on waterways in the state. Additionally, there were multiple bills that passed but were ultimately not funded by the budget committee to bolster the Land for Maine’s Future program, which keeps forests, farmlands and working waterfronts open for natural and recreational use. 
Advocates will also have to wait until next session to learn the outcome of LD 1870, which would establish a superfund for large fossil fuel companies to pay for infrastructure repairs, resiliency efforts and other costs in the rural and low-income communities disproportionately affected by flooding and other climate-related disasters. 
Since other states have found themselves in a federal legal battle for passing similar legislation, lawmakers opted for more time to see how those pan out. 
LD 1949, which was a late session bill that seeks to address the “twin challenges” of high energy costs and harmful fossil fuel emissions, was also left undecided. It passed the Senate 22-13, but did not receive a vote on the House floor so it was carried over to next year.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)These are fraught times in the United States. Elected leaders are racing headfirst down some treacherous and uncharted paths, and at such a moment, it’s easy to lose perspective and get carried away with “sky is falling” hyperbole.
And yet, it’s also undeniably true that some of the changes coming to the American social contract as a result of President Trump’s so-called “big, beautiful bill” are the most extreme in U.S. history. The new law will, for instance, slash hundreds of billions of dollars in federal appropriations for Medicaid health insurance and SNAP food assistance.
Nearly 12 million people across the nation and hundreds of thousands in North Carolina are projected to lose their health insurance over the coming years. Meanwhile, as North Carolina’s food banks explained in a recent urgent plea, the SNAP food assistance that will be cut by almost $200 billion over the next decade provides more than two billion meals each year to the 1.2 million North Carolinians classified as “food insecure.”
The proponents of the legislation allege that it will merely root our “waste, fraud and abuse” in these programs, but as even North Carolina’s Republican senior senator, Thom Tillis, has made plain, that’s just not so.
A report from his office estimates North Carolina will lose $32 billion in Medicaid funds over the next decade and the notion that the state’s health care system could somehow absorb such a hit without dramatically reducing coverage and care is beyond absurd. As the senator said prior to voting against the bill, “So what do I tell 663,000 people [people who’ve gained Medicaid coverage in recent years as the result of the bipartisan expansion law passed in 2023] in two years or three years, when President Trump breaks his promise by pushing them off of Medicaid because the funding is not there anymore?”
And so it is that a huge number of people are quite understandably terrified about what the future holds – both for their own personal financial wellbeing and, indeed, for their life expectancy as the new law takes effect.
This fact was powerfully exemplified last week at a press event in Raleigh at which Wake County Democratic state Senator Jay Chaudhuri spoke alongside a pair of local women who explained how their lives have been dramatically transformed for the better by Medicaid.
  Wake County mom Maddie Wertenberg praised Medicaid for changing her family’s life by covering costs associated with her son Oliver’s premature birth. (Photo: Rob Schofield)
Maddie Wertenberg is a Wake County mom who told the story of her son Oliver’s premature birth at which he weighed less than a pound. Wertenberg and her husband had private health insurance when Oliver was born, but even with that, they would still have been left with a crippling and life altering share of the $1.2 million bill his five-month hospital stay ran up.
Fortunately for them, Oliver’s tiny size – she described him as a “nano-preemie” – qualified as a disability for Medicaid purposes and their family’s financial future was rescued as a result. “Medicaid changed my family’s life,” Wertenberg said.
Wertenberg’s gratitude for Medicaid was echoed by a lifetime Raleigh resident named Crystal Upchurch. She explained how she was diagnosed with Lupus in 2009 and how that disease ultimately led to a serious renal condition that requires her to receive regular dialysis treatments — treatments that are, thankfully, covered by Medicaid. As she explained, her ability to continue receiving dialysis treatment is quite literally a life and death matter. “I can’t say it more clearly than this: these cuts could cost me my life,” Upchurch observed.

Similar stories will no doubt abound when it comes to hunger and nutrition. Unless state and local governments somehow find hundreds of billions of dollars to fill the gap caused by the SNAP cuts, food assistance will quickly dry up for millions. This is especially worrisome given the fact that huge numbers of children gain eligibility for free school meals by virtue of their family’s enrollment in SNAP.
Of course, many proponents of Trump’s big bill will tell you they have no intention of cutting off people like Maddie, Crystal and hungry school children. Unfortunately, when experts run the numbers, such arguments are quickly exposed as simply not credible.
Like it or not, the massive Medicaid cuts contained in the legislation will, in fact, make it inevitable that vast numbers of people with stories very similar to Maddie’s and Crystal’s will be sentenced to crippling debt, and/or premature death.

Similarly, the SNAP cuts will cause hundreds of thousands of food insecure people to fall deeper into the abyss of hunger and poverty.
Given this reality, it’s no wonder that so many people already living on the edge are experiencing one of the worst immediate impacts of the mega-bill’s passage: simple terror over what their future holds.

Dugan was indicted in May by a federal grand jury and has pleaded not guilty to charges that she impeded the arrest by federal agents of an immigrant who was appearing in her court room.  She was arrested by FBI agents in April.
Critics have condemned the arrest as an example of the Trump administration discouraging pushback to mass deportation efforts and a worrying sign for democracy. Federal and state Republicans have supported the arrest of Dugan, saying those who stand in the way of deportations should be arrested and that Dugan should resign or be removed.
The bill, cosponsored by Sen. Cory Tomczyk (R-Mosinee), Assembly Majority Leader Tyler August (R-Walworth) and Rep. Shae Sortwell (R-Two Rivers), would require that if the state Supreme Court imposes a suspension as proceedings are pending or as a disciplinary sanction due to misconduct, it must be without pay. 
The Wisconsin Supreme Court chose to suspend Dugan in April, saying it was in the public interest to relieve her of her duties for now. Dugan is still being paid her nearly $175,000 annual salary.
The lawmakers noted that Dugan’s trial was postponed from July 21 and may not take place until 2026. They said taxpayers will be paying for “an extended vacation” even as reserve judges have to fill in for her and they argued the bill is needed to stop suspended judges from getting paid in the future.
According to the Wisconsin Judicial Commission, 15 judges have been suspended by the Supreme Court from 1978 to 2024.
“In these rare circumstances, these judges’ actions and alleged misconduct rose to such a level that suspension was warranted,” the lawmakers said in a memo.  “Simply put, Wisconsin taxpayers must be protected from the misconduct and/or commission of a crime by rogue judges.”

(Sarah Vogelsong / Virginia Mercury) Public officials are advising locals to avoid the James River in Hopewell and Richmond, after a weekend water treatment plant malfunction released raw sewage into the waterway. They also said the region’s recent heavy rains play a part in pollution in the river but don’t expect long-term effects. 
On Friday night, Hopewell’s water treatment lost power and deposited about a million gallons of raw sewage into the James River. The most affected areas were Gravely Run Creek and sections of the James from the Old City Point Waterfront Park in Hopewell downstream to the Berkley Plantation — areas local and state officials have advised people and pets to steer clear of for the time being. 
“As long as there is no additional discharge, (Virginia Department of Health) expects to lift the advisory on Friday after the river system has time to flush out the sewage through dilution and degradation,” Brookie Crawford, risk communications manager with VDH, said Monday. 
Crawford also recommended that people practice safe food handling if consuming fish they’ve caught and pointed to VDH’s fish consumption advisory dashboard. As of Monday afternoon, there was no fish consumption advisory in place near Hopewell.
A Hopewell communications worker also confirmed that a permanent repair at the plant is expected to be done by the end of the week. 
WTVR first reported that faulty wiring at the water treatment plant had caused a power outage which led to the overflow. Residential sewage and drinking water were not affected, but untreated sewage flowed unabated into the James River during the incident. The plant was fully operational by Saturday, officials said.
The Department of Environmental Quality is investigating the incident. They visited the facility on Saturday and will be working with the plant to find solutions to ensure another leak won’t happen again.
A DEQ spokesperson said the sewage that entered Gravelly Run and the James River would have mixed in the water, making it impossible to clean up. Bacteria will die off over the next several days.
The swim advisory area is not expected to be expanded as the sewage moves downstream; DEQ believes it will be diluted and degraded. Recent heavy rains have led to more turbulent waters, which can also help with the breakdown of the sewage. If the plant remains operational, the swim advisory is anticipated to be lifted on July 18.
There are no long-term effects expected to impact the waterways. However, DEQ and VDH stress that people should not drink any untreated water, should shower after swimming, and should avoid swimming for three days after any significant rain.
Meanwhile, heavy rain poses additional health risks around Richmond since the city uses a combined sewage-overflow system. This means that heavy rains can allow a mix of stormwater runoff and sewage to become present in the river. Richmond has seen heavy rains most nights in recent weeks. 
“Heavy rain picks up anything it comes in contact with, including germs from overflowing sewage, polluted storm water, and runoff from land,” Crawford said. 
If a river or lake has a green film,  a chemical odor, appears cloudier than usual or has multiple dead fish, Crawford said it’s best not to get in. 
State lawmakers have tried unsuccessfully for years to earmark $50 million in the state budget to overhaul the system, though it survived negotiations earlier this year. 
 Region’s previous water woes

Hopewell’s water treatment incident is the latest central Virginia municipal water issue this year. Richmond faced two water boil advisories in January and May as its water treatment plant also faced a power outage, and later, filter clogs.
Richmond issues boil water advisory after storm disrupts water system

Richmond residents were without safe drinking water for nearly a week in early January following a power failure that signaled overdue maintenance repairs for the plant’s infrastructure. Residents in Richmond and Henrico County had to boil their water before consuming it, while those without pressure took advantage of a recent snowfall to melt and boil snow for use. Some residents also sought out natural springs in the area. The state penalized the city for the crisis.
By April, the installation of a new pump led to increased fluoride levels in local drinking water, but officials said it was still safe for consumption. Then in May, clogged filters prompted a water boil advisory for parts of the city and requests for conservation in others. 
In late June, officials from Richmond and Henrico County, which taps into part of Richmond’s water, held a water summit to dissect what went wrong and brainstorm plans for future collaboration on water infrastructure.

(NBC12)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.	
The National Center for Education Statistics’ data shows that public school enrollment in Virginia decreased 2.9% from fall 2019 to fall 2023.

According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.

A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Stock photo from Getty Images.)The Appalachian region in Ohio and elsewhere is bracing for a big hit as President Donald Trump proposed a 93% cut to funding for the Appalachian Regional Commission.
The proposal is included in a discretionary budget, a year-to-year funding proposal that is different than the mandatory funding included in the recently passed Trump-Republican megabill.
In the discretionary budget, Trump proposed a cut of 93% for the regional commission, from $200 million to $14 million in the 2026 fiscal year, according to the commission.
Local and state officials and organizations from around the region sent a letter to members of Congress asking that the funding the commission has received in the past be maintained.
“The ARC has been instrumental in driving forward (the region’s) potential,” the letter stated. “Reductions to its programs pose a risk to innovative initiatives in workforce development, community revitalization and American-made resilient energy.”

Residents of the Appalachian region spoke out against the funding cuts, saying the commission is part of the momentum that is bringing growth to the region, from skilled trades and leadership development to technical support and grants for local programs.
“The ARC is a critical organization to those of us in Appalachian Ohio,” said Amesville mayor Gary Goosman in a statement. “Funding for infrastructure, broadband and informational services is key to our success.”
According to the commission, a partnership between the ARC and the Ohio Governor’s Office of Appalachia for fiscal year 2024 created $12.5 million in investments for “affordable broadband, clean water and updated wastewater systems, highways and more,” along with $6.8 million in investment toward the Appalachian workforce.
In a report of the most recent data for the region, the commission found positive trends in unemployment rates and labor force participation, but also found that the growth in population in the area is happening at a slower rate than the nation as a whole, and the population is older than the national population, with 1 in 5 Appalachian residents ages 65 or older, according to the report.
The number of Appalachian residents living in poverty or “deep poverty,” according to the commission, stands at more than 14%. The median household income in the region is just under $65,000, which is $14,000 less than the national average.

“The data shows that Appalachian’s rural areas continue to be at increased risk for economic distress compared to its urban areas,” a release on the report stated, adding that those counties fall behind on “educational attainment and household income.”
Ohio’s 32 Appalachian counties wrap from the southwestern edge of the state, all the way around the eastern border, from Clermont County up to Ashtabula County.
Of those, Scioto, Athens, and Noble County are considered by the commission to be economically “distressed,” with 15 other counties considered “at risk,” including Highland, Adams, Pike, Vinton, Jackson, Lawrence, Gallia, Morgan, Monroe, Guernsey, Coshocton, Jefferson, Mahoning, Trumbull, and Ashtabula.
The commission report found that 90% of Appalachian adults between ages 25 and 64 have a high school diploma, but only 28.8% have a bachelor’s degree.
A separate report by the Appalachia Funders Network said the region faces “stark philanthropic inequities” as well, with a lack of nonprofit presence and “chronic underinvestment” in many areas, and 66 counties in Central Appalachia holding less than $1 per person in philanthropic assets, according to the May report.
“The findings make clear that philanthropy must do more to show up equitably in places like Central Appalachia – but it cannot do this work alone,” the report stated. “Public systems and civic infrastructure are critical to sustained, long-term impact.”
Ryan Eller, executive director of the network, said because of generations of “underinvestment and extraction,” the Appalachian Regional Commission is “one of the only consistent partners helping communities rebuild and thrive.”
“The region that helped power this nation’s growth deserves more than to be sidelined,” Eller said in response to the potential cuts. “Maintaining robust support for ARC is not only sound policy – it’s a smart investment in the resilience and prosperity of America’s heartland.”
Congress has a deadline of Sept. 30 to finalize the discretionary funding, and appropriations committees are currently working on the legislation to lay out the funding for 2026.

(Photo by Kevin Trimmer/Getty Images)A number of new laws enacted in New Hampshire this year will alter the state’s notoriously restrictive bar and liquor laws. Here’s a look at some of the legislation that could affect the hospitality landscape in the months to come.
Tightened brewpub regulations
House Bill 242, signed into law Friday by Gov. Kelly Ayotte, tightens how brewpubs are allowed to operate in New Hampshire. Under the law, which is set to take effect at the end of August, brewpubs that want to sell their beer at other restaurants and businesses will be allowed to do so only at one other establishment.
“This is what we call a very inside baseball bill,” said state Rep. John Hunt, sponsor of the bill and chair of the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee.
Hunt said HB 242 was about keeping the brewpub industry small to maintain the status quo in the state’s regulatory framework.
“We have this fantasy that we are a three-tier state,” Hunt, a Rindge Republican, said. “And a three-tier state means that you’re either a beverage manufacturer or you’re a distributor or you’re the retailer.”
Hunt said the bill is about protecting the beer distributors’ “monopoly” on the middle tier of this three-tier system.
“The brew pub is a total, total trashing of the three-tier system,” he said. “Because now you have one location and he is the bottler, he’s the distributor, and he’s the retailer.”
The new law is a follow-up to one Hunt sponsored in 2024 — which limited the amount of beer brewpubs are allowed to sell and allowed the ownership of both a pub and a restaurant at the same time. (It had previously been illegal for the owner of a restaurant to also hold a brewpub liquor license.) He said that legislation, which is now law, was a compromise between the beer distributors and retailers. However, a provision about how many other businesses brewpubs can sell to was cut from the final version. This year’s bill revived and enacted the provision that was removed last year.
Asked why it’s important for the state to protect distributors’ monopoly and the three-tier system, Hunt said: “Frankly, I think the relationship between the distributors and the licensees (retailers) is pretty sacred, and it works well, and there’s no reason to upset them.”
Mike Somers, president and CEO of the New Hampshire Lodging and Restaurant Association, which represents hotels and restaurants in the state, said the industry was unfazed by the restriction.
“You have to understand, in order for one of these brewpubs to make enough beer to self distribute to more than one additional location, they would have to make an enormous amount of beer,” Somers said. “And frankly, most of the folks in the industry that I’ve talked to didn’t really feel that the restriction was much of a restriction, because they could now own multiple brewpubs and restaurants. They could have different brands going in different places. It’s just that each one of them could only just self distribute to one other location, and frankly, most of them didn’t think they could make enough beer to even distribute to another location.”
Social districts
Another new law, House Bill 467, allows cities and towns to create “social districts,” areas in which people are allowed to purchase alcohol at restaurants and bring the drinks outside. It goes into effect in September.
Cities and towns will have to opt into the program in order to create a social district, which they would do by passing an ordinance and submitting a plan to the liquor commission. That plan would include boundaries and time limits, and the new law outlines rules they’d have to follow. Those rules include requiring all alcohol to be in the same kind of container and signage requirements.
Somers said his organization is in support of social districts. Still, he predicts it will be a sort of niche thing.
“I’ll be perfectly honest with you: I really don’t think it’s going to get huge, widespread, year-round or at least season-long adoption,” Somers said. “And the reason I say that is these areas would have to essentially be roped off. They would have to have some sort of police or monitoring at the entrances and exits to these areas. And so I think that with the sheer cost of setting it up and monitoring it on a regular basis, I suspect this is essentially going to become more for large events.”
He pointed to Manchester’s annual “Cruising Down Manchester” antique car show or Concord’s “Market Days” festival as examples.
Alcohol in the restroom
House Bill 81, which goes into effect in August, allows patrons to bring alcoholic beverages into a restroom at a bar or restaurant — an act that is currently forbidden. While the bill had bipartisan support, it became law without Ayotte’s signature. Because she didn’t sign it within five days (excluding Sundays) of it arriving on her desk, it entered law without her signature, per the rules of the New Hampshire Constitution. HB 81 was pitched as an effort to allow patrons to protect themselves from date rape drugs being placed in their drinks while they’re using the restroom.
However, Somers said the industry is concerned about the law.
“We are required to monitor the consumption of our customers to make sure they’re not overserved and those kinds of things,” he said. “And when they go into the bathroom, they are not monitored. And so we don’t know what they’re consuming in there. We don’t know who they’re giving their drink to while they’re in there. So there was a concern for underage consumption, those kinds of things. There was also the concern that, you know, once you bring a drink into the bathroom, what is the bottom of your drink picking up in the bathroom, and then bringing back out into the dining room, from a sanitary standpoint. There are just a lot of unknowns about the various things that could happen.”
He said his organization and its members “certainly appreciate the intent of the bill,” but “think that there is a much smarter way to do this.”
“I’d be shocked if there was a bar in New Hampshire or a restaurant in New Hampshire that wouldn’t basically take somebody’s drink for safe keeping as somebody went to the restroom,” Somers said.
A failed attempt to end New Hampshire’s ban on true bars
One bill that didn’t become law would’ve done away with New Hampshire’s ban on bars that don’t serve food. New Hampshire law has long required bars to serve food as a condition of their liquor license. House Bill 276 sought to create a new liquor license in the state called a “tavern license” that would allow bars to sell hard liquor, beer, and wine without serving food. The proposal was tabled by the state Senate.
Somers said his organization was glad the bill failed because many of those he represents felt it was unfair that they were subject to the requirement for so long and now new entrepreneurs would get a leg up.
“In New Hampshire, we don’t have bars. We have restaurants,” he said. “And those restaurants have to have the ability to cook and produce food. They have to have an ANSUL (fire safety) system, cooking equipment, refrigeration systems, trained staff, food safety, all of that kind of stuff. So you have all of that overhead to get your license currently.”
He said new bars wouldn’t have had those overhead expenses.
“So the concern was that that would then allow those businesses to have a competitive advantage, because they don’t have any of the overhead for the kitchen equipment, staff, product storage, etc. And so therefore they could sell their drinks to a cheaper price, which would siphon off all of the profitable business away from the restaurants.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/cocktailbar-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 06:01:30.872981

For 30 years, Askins said she and her wife have lived where the military told them to live. She grew up in Toledo, Ohio, but her wife, Alison, grew up in Omaha and Lincoln, and now they get to live “back home.” 
They moved to Omaha after Askins’ wife retired from the Marine Corps in the fall.
Askins said she wants to run for the House seat because she wants to serve something greater than herself and fight for people who “deserve strong, steady leadership” and continue her 35 years of service. 
Askins said her focus in Congress would be on improving health care, affordable housing, education and national security. She said people in the 2nd District are concerned about the recent GOP mega bill, the one President Donald Trump called the “big beautiful bill” and its “cuts” to the social safety net. 
She said she would “translate” those concerns to national policy that make access to health care more “fair and equitable.”

In a launch video her campaign shared, Askins said, “Nebraskans are yearning for leaders who can work through our differences, find common ground and wage a selfless fight for a better future.” 
The video highlights her military experiences as she responded to an attack on a U.S. naval destroyer in 2000 and her deployment to Iraq, as well as her service during the nation’s longest war, in Afghanistan. The video also says she helped pass a bill that expanded military mental health care. 
She was appointed to the VA role in 2022. 
Earlier this year, State Sen. John Cavanaugh, the son of a former Democratic congressman from Omaha, formally announced his candidacy. Denise Powell, the co-founder of a political action committee and a business owner, announced her bid in May. Besides the two highest-profile Democratic candidates, Mark Johnston and Evangelos Argyrakis have confirmed they are running. And Douglas County District Court Clerk Crystal Rhoades is considering a bid.
Askins says she “loves” that it will be a large primary, because it gives Democratic voters in the district a lot of options and a chance to pick the best qualified candidate who can also win the general election.
The district, which includes all of Douglas and Saunders Counties and a slice of western Sarpy County, is typically a target of both national parties, as one of the rare remaining districts that is politically split. It retains a slight GOP lean. 
With five-term U.S. Rep. Don Bacon retiring, the open-seat race is drawing a politically diverse and competitive field. Observers expect it to prove one of the costlier races in Congress for the 2026 midterms.  
Omaha City Council Vice President Brinker Harding and former State Sen. Brett Lindstrom of Omaha have announced bids to be the Republican nominee. 
Askins took a centrist tone. She said it’s important to approach Congress with the goal of building coalitions, because nothing can get done without building relationships. 
“​​If I’m elected, I will represent all Nebraskans and not just a certain party,” Askins said.

(Photo courtesy of Western Dairyland EOC)A new Trump administration federal rule would bar immigrants without legal status from a range of public programs, canceling a policy that was implemented nearly three decades ago.
The change bars the children of those immigrants from the Head Start child care program. It also closes the door to immigrants lacking legal status for various programs that provide mental health and substance abuse treatment, job training and other assistance.
Head Start, which provides early education and child care for low-income families, has never been required to ascertain the immigration status of its families, said Jennie Mauer, executive director of the Wisconsin Head Start Association.
Families enrolling in the program have to provide a variety of pieces of information to verify they are eligible, Mauer told the Wisconsin Examiner Monday, and the programs are “very compliance oriented” and collect “exactly what they have to collect.”
Mauer said a trusting relationship between Head Start programs and the families they serve is important.
“We’re serving some of the neediest families in our community,” she said. Some have had “challenging relationships” in the past with schools and other government agencies — making nurturing that trust even more critical, she added.
The federal Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued a notice July 10 that declared Head Start and a list of other federally funded programs would now be considered “public benefits” that exclude immigrants without legal status under a law enacted in 1996. The notice revokes a policy enacted in 1998 that had exempted the affected programs from the 1996 law.
The federal announcement said that the policy change was instituted to “ensure that taxpayer-funded program benefits intended for the American people are not diverted to subsidize illegal aliens.”
Mauer said there has been no implementation guidance from HHS since the notice.
The Wisconsin Head Start Association is among the plaintiffs in a lawsuit filed in April by the American Civil Liberties Union opposing Trump administration actions against Head Start. The other plaintiffs include parent groups in Oregon and in Oakland, California, along with state Head Start associations in Washington, Illinois and Pennsylvania.
In a statement Friday the plaintiffs said they will amend the lawsuit if the administration follows through with the limits in the July 10 announcement.
Mauer said that the Wisconsin association is advising Head Start providers to “refrain from making any immediate changes to enrollment policy until they have an opportunity to fully evaluate their legal obligations.”
She said the notice has heightened concern about the safety of children whose families might be targeted by the new federal stance. But it will affect the entire program, she said.
Mauer said a second concern is that the policy could lead some families to take their children out of the program despite their need for it. If enrollment falls below the federally prescribed level of 97% of capacity, she’s concerned that the federal government might then take back grant money — creating “a negative feedback loop,” she said.  
“I am so afraid for our families,” Mauer said. “This is fracturing the safety of all of our children. This will hurt all of the children in Head Start.”

Jill Nolin/Georgia RecorderGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger has joined a growing chorus of voices calling for the return of political contributions from the now-defunct First Liberty Building and Loan, a Newnan-based lending firm with longstanding ties to the Republican Party.
The company has come under fire after federal officials filed a lawsuit accusing First Liberty’s founder, Brant Frost IV, of running a Ponzi scheme that defrauded 300 investors out of at least $140 million. According to the complaint, Frost misled investors about the nature of his business while funneling over $5 million to himself and his family members. He also improperly used investor funds to make more than $570,000 in political contributions, the complaint alleged, all of which went to Republican candidates and committees.
“I take full responsibility for my actions and am resolved to spend the rest of my life trying to repay as much as I can to the many people I misled and let down,” Frost said in a statement issued through his lawyer. “I will be cooperating with the receiver and federal authorities and ask that everyone allow the receiver time to sort things out and do his best to repair the damage I created.” 
The allegations have shocked Georgia’s Republican political network, of which the Frost family has long been a part. In 1988, Frost served as Georgia state director for Pat Robertson, a conservative televangelist-turned-Republican presidential candidate. His son, Brant Frost V, worked as a principal at First Liberty and also served as a former vice-chair of the Georgia GOP. His daughter, Katie Frost, chairs a regional committee for the state party. Until last month, both siblings held leadership roles in the Georgia Republican Assembly, a far-right wing of the Georgia Republican Party.
Past recipients of Frost’s political contributions include Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp — who last received a donation from Frost in 2019 — as well as state Sen. Colton Moore and state Rep. Charlice Byrd, according to data from the Georgia State Ethics Commission. Other out-of-state candidates who have received major contributions from Frost include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and U.S. Rep. Lauren Boebert, a Republican from Colorado.

Raffensperger, whose office is investigating First Liberty alongside the Securities and Exchange Commission, urged recipients to return political contributions they have received from the company or from the Frost family.
“Now is the time for every elected official, candidate, or political action committee who received financial support from this entity currently under investigation to stand up and help the victims,” Raffensperger said. “Ill-gotten gains do not belong in the State Capitol.”
The Democratic Party of Georgia has also urged Republican officials to return the funds.
“We have just learned that numerous Republican elected representatives are funded by money defrauded from unsuspecting Georgians,” said DPG Chair Charlie Bailey. “Now the question is whether Brian Kemp, the Georgia Republican Party, and all the electeds who received this money will do the right thing and return it to the hardworking Georgians from whom it was stolen.”

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday it has approved its fourth naturally derived color ingredient in the past two months.
The latest color is gardenia blue, or genipin, which comes from the fruit of gardenia flowers. The announcement was billed as another step in the Make America Healthy Again initiative headed by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
“Every day, children are exposed to synthetic chemicals in food that serve no purpose and threaten their health,” Kennedy said in a statement. “The FDA’s approval of gardenia blue shows we’re finally putting kids first.”
Per the announcement, the gardenia dye can be used in sports drinks, flavored or enhanced noncarbonated water, fruit drinks, ready-to-drink teas, hard candy, and soft candy.
FDA previously approved two naturally derived blue dyes, galdieria extract and butterfly pea flower extract, which can also make green and purple hues. It also approved calcium phosphate as a naturally derived white dye to be used in ready-to-eat chicken, candy melts and sugars.
HHS and FDA announced plans in April to “phase out all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply,” and to fast track the four natural color additives that are now approved, along with other natural dyes.


SC legislation
Legislation introduced in the House and Senate this spring would ban dyes from meals served at South Carolina’s public schools.
Neither got a hearing before the 2025 session ended. But they could be taken up next year.


The announcement set a goal for the industry to “eliminate” food, drug and cosmetic synthetic dyes, including Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, and Blue No. 2 by the end of next year.
FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, said in the announcement about gardenia approval that the “expedited timeline” the administration has taken shows its “serious intent” to move away from petroleum-derived dyes.
“Now, by expanding the palette of available colors derived from natural sources, food manufacturers have a variety of options available that will make it easier to end their use of petroleum-based dyes,” Makary said in the release.
The administration also urged manufacturers to expedite their phaseout of Red No. 3 dye. FDA revoked authorization of it in January and called for a phaseout by January 2027.
According to the release, about 40% of the food industry has committed to a voluntary phaseout by 2027 of the petroleum-based food dyes.
The industry group Consumer Brands Association announced Friday its plans to voluntarily phase out synthetically derived dyes from products served at schools by the start of the 2026-2027 school year.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Eric Vryn/Getty Images)With hurricane and wildfire season well underway across much of the country, state and local emergency managers say they have little idea how much support the federal government will provide if disaster strikes. And the recent deadly floods in Texas have shown just how dire the need can be.
President Donald Trump has imposed severe cuts on the Federal Emergency Management Agency and denied some states’ requests for disaster recovery funds. FEMA also has failed to issue grants that many emergency managers rely on to fund their agencies — or to communicate its plans.
Wyoming’s Office of Homeland Security, which responds to disasters, relies on the feds for 92% of its money, said Director Lynn Budd. With that federal support in question, the state could face a precarious situation when the current grants expire at the end of September.
“If we don’t get this funding, what are we going to do?” Budd said. “You’re taking our capability away.”
Budd serves as president of the National Emergency Management Association, a nonprofit focused on public safety. She said state officials have been told by Trump that they’ve become too dependent on federal support.
Trump and officials in his administration have repeatedly talked of scaling back FEMA and pushing states to take the lead in disaster response. But in the wake of this month’s devastating flooding in Texas, administration officials have backed off Trump’s claims that he would eliminate the agency altogether.
Trump denies disaster aid, tells states to do more

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson did not grant an interview request, but issued a statement calling on states to play a larger role in disaster response.
State and local officials say Trump has provided no clarity about which disasters will qualify for federal recovery funds. He has denied support for disasters that met the existing criteria. At the same time, FEMA has yet to issue federal grants that provide much of the funding for local emergency management agencies.
As local leaders in rural Saluda County, South Carolina, work to rebuild from last year’s Hurricane Helene, they say the recovery process has been slowed by Trump administration policies making it more difficult to access disaster aid. Worse, the county’s Emergency Management Division has no idea whether the feds will release the grant funding that makes up most of its budget.
“Are we going to see the help we need arriving?” said Josh Morton, director of Saluda County’s Emergency Management Division. “I don’t know. When we pick up the phone, is there gonna be anybody there to answer?”
Aside from the cuts to state funding, FEMA under Trump’s administration has lost about a quarter of its full-time staff, according to The New York Times. The agency also cut hundreds of contractors at call centers, The Times reported, resulting in thousands of missed calls in the days following the Texas flood.
Meanwhile, emergency managers say that Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service could further impair their ability to respond to fast-moving disasters.
The feds pull back
Trump and his administration have frequently said states should take on more responsibility for responding to disasters.
Brian Hughes, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said in an April statement to Stateline that the federal government would provide support only for “truly catastrophic disasters,” adding that states should have “an appetite to own the problem.”
Emergency management experts say it would be inefficient for all 50 states to stockpile the resources, staff and recovery funding to handle disasters on their own. Having a national agency that can deploy where it’s needed is far less wasteful.
“There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has,” said Michael Coen, who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations.
He noted that FEMA also plays a key coordinating role with other federal agencies during disasters.











There’s no reason for every state to have all the resources that FEMA has.


– Michael Coen, chief of staff at FEMA during the Obama and Biden administrations



Morton, the Saluda County official, echoed that concern. He also serves as first vice president with the International Association of Emergency Managers, a nonprofit representing professionals in the field.
“It would be impossible for every county in the U.S. to maintain an adequate disaster recovery fund on their own,” he said. “Right now, we have a disaster fund at the federal level, and that money is able to be moved around to where it’s needed in the moment. That really is the best bang for the buck for the American people.”
But that federal support is no longer a sure thing. Morton said recovery funds for Hurricane Helene — which walloped states from Florida to North Carolina — have been slower to materialize than for previous disasters. FEMA officials have required more paperwork, he said, and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem’s insistence that she personally approve any expenditure over $100,000 has also slowed the process.
Disaster declarations
In other parts of the country, state officials have petitioned Trump for disaster declarations, only to be rejected altogether. Washington state’s request for disaster aid following storms last November that caused at least $34 million in damages met all the “very clear criteria to qualify,” said Democratic Gov. Bob Ferguson, but was denied by FEMA.
While Trump administration officials have proposed limiting the events that qualify for federal relief, they have yet to issue new criteria. State leaders say they have gotten no clarity from the feds about whether they can count on support.
“We really need some communication on what to expect,” said Budd, the Wyoming official. “If we know there’s no federal funding coming, that would be an awful situation, but at least we can plan for that.”
Some experts say states should prepare for disaster relief to be approved along partisan lines.
“We just have to be honest that this White House is going to spend more resources, time and effort on people who live in red states than in blue states,” said Juliette Kayyem, faculty chair of the Homeland Security Project at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government and a former Obama administration official.
“It’s a hard thing for me to admit, and I don’t know how to solve it, but if you look at his reaction to [the Los Angeles wildfires in] California as compared to Texas, it’s very clear.”
Since February, Trump has denied six of the 10 major-disaster requests he has received from Democratic governors, according to an analysis from Seattle National Public Radio affiliate KUOW. He has approved 14 of 15 requests he has received from Republican governors during that same period.
Meanwhile, FEMA has yet to release the preparedness grants that many state and local governments depend on to fund their emergency management agencies and conduct projects to prepare for disasters. Those grants were set to be issued in May under a spending bill passed by Congress.
Trump wants states to handle disasters without FEMA. They say they can’t.

Coen, the former FEMA official, noted that the Texas Division of Emergency Management received nearly $20 million in federal funding last year to support day-to-day operations.
“Texas hasn’t been able to apply for that grant this year,” he said. “If they never get that grant, are they going to have to lay off staff or cancel contracts?”
FEMA has also revoked another set of grants, totaling $3.6 billion, that was intended to help communities prepare their infrastructure to withstand disasters.
Weather agency cuts
Amid the uncertainty at FEMA, emergency managers are also alarmed by Trump’s cuts to the National Weather Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. NOAA has lost nearly 2,000 employees, The New York Times reported, 600 of whom worked for the weather service.
The cuts have left many forecasting offices understaffed, with some no longer able to operate overnight.
“The National Weather Service plays as big of a role in protecting lives as anyone else in government,” said Morton, the Saluda County official. “It would be very hard for emergency managers to do our jobs effectively without the National Weather Service. But if these cuts keep coming, you’re going to start to see deficiencies.”
Budd, the Wyoming official, said the weather agency is crucial during wildfires.
“That’s how we know when it’s time to alert our communities or evacuate an area,” she said. “You can put firefighters’ lives on the line very quickly if they don’t have notification that those winds are changing.”
She added that Trump’s cuts to the U.S. Forest Service and other land management agencies have added another layer of concern as wildfires begin cropping up throughout the West. With the loss of federal support, Budd said officials are likely to become increasingly reliant on state-to-state resource-sharing compacts that allow them to call on one another during emergency situations.

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

 
There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-15 09:00:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Lawmakers carve a new path around CT budget cap,Keith M. Phaneuf,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/15/ct-budget-cap-underfunding/,Conservatives say the move is a push toward irresponsible spending. But progressives counter it’s the only way to protect core services.,"State officials have underfunded key contractual obligations in Connecticut’s budget by hundreds of millions of dollars for the second consecutive year, knowing the rest of the plan will generate more than enough surplus to cover the problem.
This underfunding allows legislators to assign more dollars to education, municipal aid and other core programs without violating budget caps.
And then, once the budget is in force — and those seemingly intentional shortfalls have been certified officially — legislators have the emergency authority to order extra spending and meet all legal obligations, also without violating the caps.
Conservatives say the latest underfunding problem, identified two weeks into the new fiscal year, represents a push toward deceptive, irresponsible spending. But progressives counter it’s the only way to protect core services from hyper-aggressive budget caps that mandate excessive savings.
“The least we could do is provide the taxpayers with an honest budget, and we haven’t even done that,” said Senate Minority Leader Stephen Harding, R-Brookfield. “It’s eventually going to lead us to a [problem] when we’re not going to be able to solve it.”
Officials learned this week that projected health benefit costs for state employees and retirees will exceed budgeted levels by $66 million. The gap grows to $144 million in 2026-27.
Though relatively small given the overall budget’s $27.2 billion bottom line, the problem isn’t insignificant, given that the fiscal year is barely underway.
“It’s certainly something that we’re going to have to figure out,” House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, said Monday, adding that it could be addressed this fall when legislators meet in special session to review the impact of federal budget cuts on state revenues.
The health care shortfall confirmed by Comptroller Sean Scanlon would be larger had he not negotiated savings worth almost $77 million across two years with insurance carriers earlier this summer.
The comptroller added that “we are very conservative with our estimates” and that his office would continue to search for efficiencies. “We try to get the best cost that we can.”
Lamont’s budget spokesman, Chris Collibee, said only that the administration “continuously monitors spending and revenue on a monthly basis and advises the governor and legislature on potential actions that may be necessary in response.”
But a solution won’t be that hard to find.
This fiscal year, the first of the new biennial budget, has a built-in operating surplus of $309 million, and the cushion grows to $557 million next year. 
And a second savings program, which bars legislators from spending a portion of income and business tax receipts, will capture more than $1.3 billion in the first year of the biennium and $1.25 billion in the second, according to state analysts.
The combined budgetary safety net is 24 times the size of this year’s projected health care cost overrun, and 12 1/2 times larger than the second year’s estimated problem.
In other words, state government has more than enough money to adequately fund employee and retiree health care.
Adding to the confusion, Scanlon warned Lamont and the General Assembly about these health care cost challenges months before the new budget was adopted.
Connecticut faced a similar situation one year ago.
Despite early warnings from Lamont, legislators opted not to adjust a preliminary budget to avert likely shortfalls tied to Medicaid and retirement benefits.
But within a few weeks after that fiscal year had begun, about $170 million in projected cost overruns were reported in these areas. Officials brushed them off, as overall state finances were on pace for yet another massive surplus. 
Final numbers from the just-completed fiscal year won’t be reported until September, but Lamont’s budget office pegs that windfall at almost $2.2 billion. That’s about 10% of last year’s General Fund and the second-largest surplus in Connecticut history.
COVID grants had offered a path around spending cap
So why didn’t legislators and Lamont budget more for problem areas over the past two years?
The answer lies chiefly within budget controls and particularly within a spending cap that tries to keep program growth in line with household income and inflation.
Critics have argued for years that the spending cap, which dates to 1991, is flawed, particularly because it doesn’t recognize that certain large budget accounts, such as Medicaid, often grow faster than do household income or inflation. The same was true in the 2000s and much of the 2010s for contractually mandated contributions to pensions for state employees and municipal teachers.
Other budget caps, including the program that captures a portion of income and business taxes, have cooperated with the spending cap to force overall surpluses averaging more than $1.8 million, or roughly 8% of the General Fund, since 2017.
That’s a huge number, given that about three-quarters of the entire state budget largely is fixed by contract or other legal obligations.
State officials were able to craft budgets, despite those savings rules, between 2020 and 2024 largely because Connecticut had received billions of dollars in emergency federal COVID grants. That assistance could be spent outside of normal fiscal cap rules on nearly all programs. So if the spending cap blocked more funding, for example, for social services, federal grants picked up the slack.
But those funds largely had been exhausted by the close of last fiscal year on June 30.
So the conscious underfunding of certain accounts becomes another method to work around the spending cap. By paying less into worker health care or Medicaid accounts, legislators can dedicate more money for education, municipal aid or other core services without, officially, exceeding the spending cap.
And because those worker health care and Medicaid expenses ultimately must be covered because of contracts or other legal agreements, the legislature then has emergency authority to appropriate extra funds. This usually is done many months later, long after the shortfall has officially been reported.
“This is federal government-style budgeting,” said House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford. “Sadly, the Connecticut residents are the ones that are going to pay for it.”
Candelora noted his caucus fully funded worker health care benefits in a biennial plan it offered back in early May. 
But all officials — not just progressive Democratic legislators — have found it hard to live within these budget caps as federal COVID grants have been exhausted.
Lamont, a fiscally moderate Democrat, underfunded contractually mandated health care benefits for state workers and retirees by almost $230 million in the biennial budget proposal he submitted to lawmakers last February, despite warnings from Scanlon.
The governor also convinced legislators to use an accounting gimmick to shift hundreds of millions of dollars outside of the traditional state budget to launch his new initiative to dramatically expand affordable child care program slots by the early 2030s.
House Republicans also used an off-budget account to support a similar child care program expansion effort in a biennial plan they pitched in early May.
And while Senate Republicans called many of these initiatives “gimmicks,” their caucus didn’t even propose a new two-year budget.
CT For All, a coalition of more than 60 faith, labor and other civic organizations, has joined other progressive organizations in calling for these savings rules to be eased and for greater investments in core services.
“We cannot continue to excuse the sufferings of our communities in order to irresponsibly manage our long-term liabilities,” said Norma Martinez HoSang, director of CT For All.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/2025_0602_SR_Session_039-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 06:01:30.872981

At a time in which our nation continues to experience the regular horror of school shootings, it’s understandable that everyone grasps for ideas – anything – that seems like it might prevent or reduce the terrifying carnage.
The gruesome notion of a disturbed killer gunning down innocent children is enough to make anyone wish that they could be present with a weapon of their own to stop them.
Unfortunately, as understandable as that instinct is, it simply can’t be the basis of public policy. That should be based on a dispassionate assessment of the facts and data, and it’s for that reason that Gov. Josh Stein did the right thing last week by vetoing a bill that would allow private school personnel and volunteers to carry loaded firearms on campus while children are present.
The bottom line: As the Governor rightfully noted, it’s one thing to have armed law enforcement officers with hundreds of hours of training on campus. Turning security over to volunteers with just a few hours as the bill permits would be much more likely to compromise school safety than enhance it.

Jon Husted. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)The office of Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted has deleted a social media post after being asked about the message it sent. The post on X claimed that President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act is a “pro-family” bill” for “working class families.” 
The law will take health insurance and food support away from thousands of low-income, working Ohioans. The post touting it pictured Husted laughing it up with two men who appear to be prominent special-interest lobbyists.
Husted’s office hasn’t responded to a request for comment.
Gov. Mike DeWine earlier this year appointed Husted — who was then lieutenant governor — to fill the Senate seat vacated by JD Vance when Vance became Trump’s vice president. 
Husted, who will run next year in a special election, has since supported Trump’s appointments and his legislative agenda. 
That includes Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a controversial piece of legislation that squeaked through with Republican majorities in both chambers of Congress, and Vance casting a tie-breaking vote in the U.S. Senate. 
On Thursday in a 9:10 a.m. post on X, Husted lauded the bill and attacked Democrats who opposed it.
“Democrats want this president to fail,” it said. “And, if that means Americans fail, too, Democrats are OK with that. That’s not acceptable. Republicans just led by passing a pro-family, pro-business, pro-growth, pro-America bill for working class families.”
  A screen grab of a post by U.S. Sen. Jon Husted, R-Ohio, that his office later deleted.
One of the reasons that the bill is so controversial is that it provides giant tax cuts that will increase deficits by $3.8 trillion, the nonpartisan Tax Foundation reports. 
Husted’s office didn’t respond when asked whether he agreed with that estimate and to explain how ballooning the national debt was pro-business, pro-America, or pro-growth.
Of the tax cuts in the bill, $1 trillion will go to the richest 1% of Americans over the next decade, according to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.
Proposed SNAP changes could swamp Ohio’s overburdened system

Meanwhile, it will cut more than $1 trillion from Medicaid and $186 billion from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.
In sum, the Yale Budget Lab concluded, the bill will give the richest 1% — about 3 million Americans — $30,000 more a year on average. Meanwhile, the poorest 20% — 68 million Americans — will get $700 less, the analysis said. 
The legislation delayed the deepest pain from the cuts until the beginning of 2027 — just after the 2026 midterm elections in which Husted must run.
Ohio food bank officials said that when the food cuts take effect, they’ll be overwhelmed. 
And emergency doctors say the Medicaid cuts will explode wait times and degrade care for all Ohioans. That’s because the cuts threaten to take health coverage away from hundreds of thousands of Ohioans and swamp providers with patients who can’t pay.
Husted’s office also didn’t respond to questions asking how those policies are pro-family or good for the working class. 
And it took down the post on X after being asked by the Capital Journal about the men Husted was pictured with in it. 
They weren’t identified in the post, but one appears to be Tom Balzer, CEO of the Ohio Trucking Association. His web bio boasts “significant legislative wins. Including a 1,400% increase in assets, greater transparency and membership engagement, increased donations to the Political Action Committee and a heightened presence in Ohio politics.”
He’s listed as an agent for the Trucking Association and the Ohio Chapter of International Warehouse and Logistics Association on a database maintained by the Ohio Joint Legislative Ethics Committee.
The other man pictured laughing with Husted appears to be Victor Hipsley of the Governmental Policy Group. He’s registered as lobbying for dozens of special interests, including the Ohio Coal Association, Koch Government Affairs, and Duke Energy Business Services.
Neither lobbyist responded when asked whether they agreed with Husted’s support for Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

(Photo by Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images)Cincinnati-area imam and hospital chaplain Ayman Soliman is currently being held at the Butler County jail. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him at a routine check-in last week.
Soliman fled Egypt in 2014 and was granted asylum status in the U.S. in 2018. Since then, he’s applied for a green card, and worked as a chaplain, including at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.
Soliman has no criminal record in the U.S., but in June, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services revoked Soliman’s asylum status. He’s currently challenging the move in court.
Attorneys for Soliman have also filed a habeas corpus petition to keep Soliman in the Butler County jail. They worry the government might move him a different facility, potentially putting him in a less favorable jurisdiction while cutting him off from legal counsel.
“We have witnessed numerous incidents of detainees being removed under the cover of darkness and hastily shuffled from one location to another without legal contact,” Muslim Legal Fund of American Attorney Kate Brady said. “This filing is an attempt to shield Mr. Soliman from these detrimental tactics, and we urge the Court to fulfill our request.”
Cincinnati’s Democratic U.S. Rep. Greg Landsman said on Facebook he’d gotten commitments that ICE would not move Soliman.
On Monday, District Court Judge Michael Barrett directed parties in the case to figure out timing for an immediate conference, but as of Monday afternoon there’s been no official decision on the habeas petition.
In an email, an ACLU of Ohio spokeswoman said they expect Soliman to have a bond hearing July 23.
In a written statement a Department of Homeland Security spokesman stressed that a pending application or lawful status don’t shield a person from immigration enforcement action.
“USCIS is responsible for administering America’s lawful immigration system, ensuring the integrity of the immigration process, and protecting the interests of the American people by screening and vetting aliens,” the statement continued. “But generally speaking, and as a matter of practice, USCIS does not discuss the details of individual immigration cases and adjudication decisions.”
How we got here
According to Soliman’s habeas petition, federal authorities informed him last December that they would begin the process of revoking his asylum status. On June 3, his asylum status was officially terminated.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
According to an affidavit, Soliman challenged his revocation and initially got a July 3 court date. The court date got pushed back and ICE asked him to show up for a regular check-in.
Instead, when he showed up July 9, Soliman was met by an ICE and FBI agents who subsequently interrogated him for more than two hours.
They asked about his “views on Egyptian politicians and well known organizations in Egypt and in the surrounding Middle East area,” Soliman’s affidavit described. They also asked about Soliman’s time in the U.S. and his family’s political affiliations.
At the end of the interview, the agents placed Soliman under arrest. His attorney argued Soliman is not a flight risk or a threat to the community, and offered to have him wear an ankle monitor or check in regularly on a phone app. The agents turned her down.
In a press release, Soliman’s attorney Nazly Mamedova argued, “Mr. Soliman overcame hurdles to create a home in the United States, following every rule and process along the way. We remain steadfast in our commitment to securing his safety and release.”
Soliman’s case has prompted pushback from local leaders and state lawmakers who argue federal officials aren’t being transparent.
State Rep. Rachel Baker, D-Cincinnati, called Soliman “a man of peace and empathy — a caregiver, a faith leader, and a bridge-builder in our community.”
“It is deeply disturbing that we are now detaining non-criminal religious leaders who are following the legal process,” she added. “We are calling for answers and accountability following his unexpected detention. The America I believe in prioritizes compassion, common sense, and due process.”
The problems came to light in 2021, when Soliman was offered a job as a chaplain with the Oregon Department of Corrections. Soliman’s job offer was eventually rescinded because he was unable to clear up an FBI flag in his background check.
Looking for answers, Soliman filed record requests with federal agencies and eventually took them to court.
“The Department of Corrections could not fully clear him to begin his position because of an unresolved ‘FBI flag’ on his background check,” his complaint states. “That, combined with the numerous “SSSS” designations on his boarding passes when he travels, give him reason to believe he is included in the Terrorist Screening Database.”
The Ohio Capital Journal reached out to the FBI about Soliman’s status.
“The FBI does not confirm or deny an individual’s watchlist status,” a spokesperson wrote back. “The Threat Screening Center (TSC) is dedicated to ensuring watchlisting and screening activities are conducted in a manner consistent with protecting privacy and civil liberties.”

If Musk is to go through with his plan to develop his new America Party, he’ll have to navigate a patchwork of state-level ballot rules. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party, and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Ashley Murray/States Newsroom)Legal battles over President Donald Trump’s executive order to end birthright citizenship continued on July 10, 2025, after a New Hampshire federal district judge issued a preliminary injunction that will, if it’s not reversed, prevent federal officials from enforcing the order nationally.

The ruling by U.S. District Judge Joseph Laplante, a George W. Bush appointee, asserts that this policy of “highly questionable constitutionality … constitutes irreparable harm.”
In its ruling in late June, the Supreme Court allowed the Trump administration to deny citizenship to infants born to undocumented parents in many parts of the nation where individuals or states had not successfully sued to prevent implementation – including a number of mid-Atlantic, Midwest and Southern states.
Trump’s executive order limits U.S. citizenship by birth to those who have at least one parent who is a U.S. citizen or legal permanent resident. It denies citizenship to those born to undocumented people within the U.S. and to the children of those on student, work, tourist and certain other types of visas.
The preliminary injunction is on hold for seven days to allow the Trump administration to appeal.
The June 27 Supreme Court decision on birthright citizenship limited the ability of lower-court judges to issue universal injunctions to block such executive orders nationwide.
Laplante was able to avoid that limit on issuing a nationwide injunction by certifying the case as a class action lawsuit encompassing all children affected by the birthright order, following a pathway suggested by the Supreme Court’s ruling.
Pathways beyond universal injunctions
In its recent birthright citizenship ruling, Trump v. CASA, the Supreme Court noted that plaintiffs could still seek broad relief by filing such class action lawsuits that would join together large groups of individuals facing the same injury from the law they were challenging.
And that’s what happened.
Litigants filed suit in New Hampshire’s district court the same day that the Supreme Court decided CASA. They asked the court to certify a class consisting of infants born on or after Feb. 20, 2025, who would be covered by the order and their parents or prospective parents. The court allowed the suit to proceed as a class action for these infants.
What if this injunction doesn’t stick?

If the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit or the Supreme Court invalidates the New Hampshire court’s newest national injunction and another injunction is not issued in a different venue, the order will then go into effect anywhere it is not currently barred from doing so. Implementation could begin in as many as 28 states where state attorneys general have not challenged the Trump birthright citizenship policy if no other individuals or groups secure relief.
As political science scholars who study race and immigration policy, we believe that, if implemented piecemeal, Trump’s birthright citizenship order would create administrative chaos for states determining the citizenship status of infants born in the United States. And it could lead to the first instances since the 1860s of infants being born in the U.S. being denied citizenship categorically.
States’ role in establishing citizenship
Almost all U.S.-born children are issued birth certificates by the state in which they are born.
The federal government’s standardized form, the U.S. standard certificate of live birth, collects data on parents’ birthplaces and their Social Security numbers, if available, and provides the information states need to issue birth certificates.
But it does not ask questions about their citizenship or immigration status. And no national standard exists for the format for state birth certificates, which traditionally have been the simplest way for people born in the U.S. to establish citizenship.
If Trump’s executive order goes into effect, birth certificates issued by local hospitals would be insufficient evidence of eligibility for federal government documents acknowledging citizenship. The order would require new efforts, including identification of parents’ citizenship status, before authorizing the issuance of any federal document acknowledging citizenship.
Since states control the process of issuing birth certificates, they will respond differently to implementation efforts. Several states filed a lawsuit on Jan. 21 to block the birthright citizenship order. And they will likely pursue an arsenal of strategies to resist, delay and complicate implementation.
While the Supreme Court has not yet confirmed that these states have standing to challenge the order, successful litigation could bar implementation in up to 18 states and the District of Columbia if injunctions are narrowly framed, or nationally if lawyers can persuade judges that disentangling the effects on a state-by-state basis will be too difficult.
Other states will likely collaborate with the administration to deny citizenship to some infants. Some, like Texas, had earlier attempted to make it particularly hard for undocumented parents to obtain birth certificates for their children.
Potential for chaos

If the Supreme Court rejects attempts to block the executive order nationally again, implementation will be complicated.
That’s because it would operate in some places and toward some individuals while being legally blocked in other places and toward others, as Justice Sonia Sotomayor warned in her Trump v. CASA dissent.
Children born to plaintiffs anywhere in the nation who have successfully sued would have access to citizenship, while other children possibly born in the same hospitals – but not among the groups named in the suits – would not.
Babies born in the days before implementation would have substantially different rights than those born the day after. Parents’ ethnicity and countries of origin would likely influence which infants are ultimately granted or denied citizenship.
That’s because some infants and parents would be more likely to generate scrutiny from hospital employees and officials than others, including Hispanics, women giving birth near the border, and women giving birth in states such as Florida where officials are likely to collaborate enthusiastically with enforcement.
The consequences could be profound.
Some infants would become stateless, having no right to citizenship in another nation. Many people born in the U.S. would be denied government benefits, Social Security numbers and the ability to work legally in the U.S.
With the constitutionality of the executive order still unresolved, it’s unclear when, if ever, some infants born in the U.S. will be the first in the modern era to be denied citizenship.

The Central Ohio Poison Center reported 582 marijuana exposures to children under six in 2024 — compared to 79 in 2019 and 11 back in 2015, said Natalie Rine, director of the Central Ohio Poison Center, which covers 64 of Ohio’s 88 counties and receives more than 42,000 poison exposure calls annually.

“There’s been a pretty significant increase in exposures in that age group since legalization,” she said. “It’s odd for us to go a day without having a call about a kid getting into one of these products. … As access to something increases, it’s not surprising that the exposures increase with it.” 
Ohioans passed a citizen-initiated law to legalize recreational marijuana in 2023 with 57% of the vote, and sales started in August 2024. Ohio medical marijuana sales started in 2019. 
Children
Children who have ingested marijuana tend to be drowsy, sleepy, confused and, in some cases, have trouble breathing, Rine said. It can take hours after a child has consumed marijuana until the symptoms appear. 
“These kids can have seizures sometimes as well,” she said. “… We don’t really have an antidote or anything that we can really reach for. A lot of the care that they’re going to receive when they go to the hospital is going to be direct monitoring.” 
Although it’s not common, there have been times — depending on the amount of  marijuana ingested — where doctors have to put a child on a ventilator for a day or two until the drug gets out of their system, Rine said.
She recommends parents keep their marijuana products out of sight and out of reach in lock boxes. 
“We don’t recommend using them in front of children because children like to mimic what their parents do,” she said. “Don’t store these products where they can be confused with other snacks.”
It’s not just the youngest children who have seen an uptick in marijuana exposures. Children ages 6-12 had 192 marijuana exposures and teenagers 13-19 had 254 in 2024, according to the Central Ohio Poison Center. In 2019, there were 20 exposures to children 6-12 years old and 119 to teenagers 13-19.
 Pets

Marijuana is listed as ninth most common toxin for pets in Ohio, according to Pet Poison Helpline. 
Dr. Edward Cooper, professor of small animal emergency at Ohio State University’s College of Veterinary Medicine, said he has seen a bit of an increase of pets accidentally ingesting marijuana after recreational sales started last summer, but was expecting more of an uptick. 
“In fairness, part of it may be we’re college campus adjacent, so we’ve always had a, we’ll say, a decent measure of patients presenting with suspected or confirmed THC or marijuana exposure,” he said. 
Sometimes pet owners would be a bit hesitant to admit their pet ingested marijuana before it was legal in Ohio, Cooper said. 
“We’d have to do a little bit of sleuthing … versus people being a little bit more forthcoming,” he said. 
Pets that have ingested marijuana tend to wobble on their feet, stumble when they walk, dribble urine, have smaller than normal pupils, be sleepy and quiet, but tend to overreact when stimulated, Cooper said. 
Pet owners should seek veterinary care if their pet has ingested a significant amount of marijuana or THC products, Cooper said. 
“If smaller dogs get exposed to some of the higher concentration THC containing products then it can be a medical emergency,” he said. “They can progress to loss of consciousness. It can affect their breathing, and that’s something that we definitely would need to intervene on.” 
There are medications that can bind up the THC in their blood, Cooper said. 
He said it’s more of a gray area if the pet has ingested a mild to moderate amount of THC, but “erring on the side of caution (and) seeking some veterinary care … would be a very reasonable thing to do.”

Ohio House Republicans plan to override Gov. Mike DeWine’s vetoes on provisions they say would provide property tax relief but that public school advocates say come at the expense of education.
It is expected to be a tight vote.
Many teachers were relieved when DeWine vetoed several school-related provisions in the state budget, ones that Cleveland Heights School Board Member Dan Heintz said would harm public education.
“It would have been a race to the bottom,” Heintz said. “It would have put school districts around the state in a constant levy cycle.”
DeWine vetoed restrictions on the ability to put emergency levies on the ballot or request an increase to a current levy. That provision would have eliminated levy replacements on property taxes for all political subdivisions.
For schools, it would have prohibited them from imposing a fixed-sum emergency levy, a substitute emergency levy, and a combined school district income tax and fixed-sum property tax levy.
He also removed a provision that would have allowed county budget commissions to unilaterally take money away from passed school levies if they find it “reasonably necessary.”
The governor vetoed another that would have required that emergency and substitute tax levies, incremental growth levies, conversion levies, and the property tax portion of combined income tax and property tax levies be included in the 20-mill floor calculation for school funding purposes.
But the relief that educators felt didn’t last long, as Ohio House Republicans announced their intention to override the governor.
“To make sure that our taxpayers across Ohio see some type of decrease or prevention of the spikes that will happen, we have to override the governor’s veto to essentially be effective for Nov. 1,” state Rep. David Thomas, R-Jefferson, said Friday.
Thomas and House GOP leaders have asked lawmakers to come back from their summer recess and override the three school-specific vetoes.
“What I’m hearing constantly from my taxpayers is that they need decreases and they need tax reform now,” Thomas said.
But not every Republican is on board, like former House Speaker Jason Stephens, R-Kitts Hill, who said this will hurt schools more than it will help.
“An override — it’s a big deal,” Stephens said. “My concern is if the legislature overrides these particular vetoes, it’s really not going to do that much to lower people’s property taxes.”
Stephens isn’t coming back for the override session. We’ve confirmed that at least three other GOP lawmakers aren’t returning or are voting no.
Several others who had previously told OCJ/WEWS they were no votes could not be reached on Friday.
“The summer is busy,” Stephens said.
To override the governor takes 60 votes. With only 65 Republicans, Thomas can only afford to lose six people.
“I would say that members who are saying they’re not coming back — it’s our job, it’s our duty as elected representatives of the taxpayers of Ohio to make these votes and to do what’s in the best interests of our residents,” Thomas said.
On Thursday, we asked the governor for his thoughts.
“They have every right to come back and make their decision,” DeWine said.
In an attempt to prevent an override, the governor created a new property tax working group to evaluate the best solutions.
“We have to give them some relief, at the same time, we have to balance this so that we continue or able to fund our schools,” DeWine said.
The working group will be run by former Cincinnati Republican lawmaker Bill Seitz and Ohio Business Roundtable CEO Pat Tiberi.
Seitz said that he is helping to point out to lawmakers that the vetoed provisions could be improved by changing their language.
Heintz said he hopes that the lawmakers will listen to the governor, Seitz, and Tiberi.
“We stretch every dollar we have,” Cleveland Heights School Board Member Heintz said. “This can be done without the micromanagement of Mr. Thomas and the Ohio legislature.”
The vote is set to take place on July 21, with the Ohio Senate following that day or later that week.

(Getty Images)During a recent conversation with folks from across Kansas, someone shared a story about a child speaking disrespectfully to a parent in public.
As they told the story, their body language shifted, their tone tightened, and it was clear they were reliving the moment with visible intolerance. The story was presented as evidence of a parent who simply didn’t care about how their child spoke to them. That moment opened a broader discussion on parenting, “out of control” kids, and the belief that today’s parents need to do better.
As a child trauma therapist, I’ve seen those moments play out more times than I can count. As a single mother many years ago, I was that parent. And every time I found myself on the receiving end of glares, unsolicited advice, or outright judgment, I hoped the people watching wouldn’t break their ankles jumping to conclusions. Instead, I prayed they’d walk, carefully, intentionally, down the path of empathy, if only for a few steps.
If they had asked (and most didn’t), they would have learned that I was a single mom working full time, going to school full time, and raising a child with undiagnosed autism. Meltdowns, yelling, boundary-testing — those were daily experiences in our home. Sometimes the goal was just to make it to bedtime without either of us breaking. I didn’t forget how I was raised. I just had to decide which battles were worth fighting.
“Pick your battles” wasn’t a parenting strategy. It was survival. I needed to save my energy for the moments that felt like life or death, not for preserving the comfort of onlookers.
There’s a kind of disconnect I often see, especially from those who’ve never had to live in survival mode, or who didn’t even realize they were in survival mode because someone else was shielding them from it. At some point, that child becomes an adult, and hopefully, they begin asking uncomfortable questions. Why did we only eat rice for dinner every night? Why did we play “indoor camping” with candles and flashlights when it was not storming outside?
Those realizations matter. They are the first cracks in the lens of innocence. And while childhood protection is necessary, it allows our children to hold onto wonder just a little longer. It also can unintentionally create a bubble that limits compassion.
When that bubble stays intact too long, it can create adults who ignore a mother begging for her child to use a locked restroom because she hasn’t bought a drink yet. A child who needs to use the bathroom urgently shouldn’t be up for a policy debate. But when policy is prioritized over people, we become complicit in inflicting pain. The question is: Do we want to be right, or do we want to be human?
Empathy is not about perfection. It is not always convenient. But it is powerful. It pauses judgment. It redirects the impulse to react and replaces it with a willingness to listen. It opens the door for the kind of response that stings the eyes and chokes the throat, not out of guilt, but out of the realization that there’s a world we’ve been blind to.
Nicole Price, my mentor and a leadership strategist with a doctorate in education, recently posted about the shift in the Black vote from Republican to Democratic. There is plenty of debate about what the actual turning point was. But the part we often miss is this: Coretta Scott King was desperate for her husband to be released from jail. She appealed to John F. Kennedy. As a result of his response, her father-in-law, Rev. Martin Luther King Sr., changed the course of an entire voting population with his voice.
Regardless of where you fall on the politics of that moment, the focus here is empathy. Empathy moved her. It moved him. And in that moment, empathy moved a nation.
Empathy is not a weakness or passivity. It is a radical, active force that demands courage, humility, and perspective. It is time for an empathy revolution.
In our families, in our communities, and in our politics, it is not enough to observe, we must choose to understand. The next time you see a human being reaching their limit, pause without mocking or questioning their struggle. Listen to their story, and then act with compassion. Because when we choose empathy, we don’t just change outcomes, we change the world.

(Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images)Minutes before the surreal show of force by masked, heavily armed federal agents, kids were playing on the soccer field in MacArthur Park in Los Angeles, and a children’s summer camp in the historic immigrant neighborhood was having fun.
“Better get used to us now because this is gonna be normal very soon,” said Customs Border Chief Gregory Bovino after ICE agents and military units arrived at the local park carrying rifles and traveling on foot, horseback, and in armored vehicles.
Children and families scattered in terror.
Mission accomplished?
Faceless federal law enforcement moved, unprovoked, on a city park in a major American city in the middle of the day to conduct an apparent immigration sweep with weapons mounted on tanks.
 I cannot get the video out of my head. It should rattle every one of us to our core. Boots on the ground in the land of the free? You okay with that? 
The armed occupation scene in LA that went viral is not a one-off, people. 
Expect the camouflaged army of state police — deployed in full tactical gear to a mostly empty urban park — to greatly expand its militaristic campaign against the racially suspicious in the U.S., citizens or not, following a massive budget infusion from congressional Republicans. 
Unlimited funding has evidently convinced heady enforcers of state-sponsored intimidation and cruelty tactics that they’re untouchable. 
When a rightly livid LA mayor demanded the outrageous ICE assaults on her city stop, the democratically elected leader of over 3,770,000 Angelenos was simply dismissed by the top border official. 
“The federal government doesn’t work for Karen Bass,” huffed Bovino. (So, who does it work for?) 
Moreover, he declared, the veiled federal agents dressed for war weren’t leaving LA until they were good and ready. 
Until their indiscriminate dragnet of people with brown skin met an indefinite quota of no mercy, i.e., prolonged detention without due process and deportation to third countries where the human cargo lacks citizenship, family ties, and protection.

By now you know the vast majority of people being grabbed off the streets, slammed up against walls, ripped from their children, ambushed outside courtrooms, chased down farm fields, and generally terrorized by tough guys who hide behind neck gaiters, are not hardened criminals who threaten anybody. 
They are not even close to being the “worst of the worst” that Trump pledged to deport, according to the government’s own data. 
The besieged populations are the present-day huddled masses whose only crime is working hard and paying taxes in the United States without legal status. 
Some are parents and grandparents with first- and second-generation progeny. 
Many have been on the spectrum of regular ICE check-ins to asylum-seekers and those on the long path to citizenship for years, if not decades. 
They are fixtures in their communities, neighbors, friends. Today they are hunted as prey. Deprived of dignity. Treated as less than human. Wrestled into submission and stuffed into unmarked vehicles bound for unknown destinations. 
Are you ready for armed occupation on steroids in Ohio tearing immigrant communities apart for sadistic spectacle? It is coming. Every single Ohio Republican member of Congress voted for it, while showering billionaires with tax handouts.
With a three-fold increase in its budget, ICE is poised explode its militarized immigration enforcement and detention operation to a level never seen before. Picture thousands of new agents deployed throughout the country. Double the detention centers.
Immigration-related arrests across Ohio have already tripled across the state under Trump. (Imagine it six months from today.) 
A New York Times analysis of the pattern and pace of immigration enforcement from Jan. 20 to June 10 showed raw arrest numbers in Ohio spiked by 209% since Inauguration Day. 
The state’s ICE detention capacity also shot up significantly from two facilities and roughly 120 beds to half a dozen county jails with 1,450 beds.
Ohio’s Geauga County continues its fight to keep ICE contract secret

Housing ICE inmates is a money-maker for counties with struggling budgets and some zealously guard their contractual arrangements with ICE from the public.  
Meanwhile, hundreds of Ohio migrants have been incarcerated, cut off from family and work not for criminal conduct — they pose zero threat according to even ICE metrics — but for navigating a civil immigration system replete with problems. 
Yet for weeks that can stretch into months, prisoners with no criminal histories sit behind bars denied bond and hope. 
Human beings who have been a rich part of the fabric of Ohio, who have filled acute labor shortages in the state and revitalized declining economies are left to rot in cramped cages before, with little notice, they’re shipped back to their origin country or some distant place they’ve never been.
Adding to the depravity that paralyzes Ohio immigrants with fear are Republican state lawmakers pushing several bills through the legislature to enhance the arrest and detention of “any person who is, or is suspected of being unlawfully present in the U.S.”  
They are, in effect, setting the stage for something Ohioans are wholly unprepared to process — the expansive overreach of militarized ICE operations moving, unprovoked, on Ohio cities and towns to seize and disappear even any person suspected of being unlawfully present in the state. 
Get used to a police state and tanks in the road, border chief? Normalize gut-wrenching inhumanity on a mass scale in America?
Never. Never. Never.

Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.

A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

Photos contributed by the candidatesIt’s election day again in Georgia and voters will decide which candidate in the Democratic primary runoff will advance to November’s general election for a chance to win the District 3 seat on the Georgia Public Service Commission.

For more information about the candidates and where they stand on the big issues, read our previous coverage here. 

Keisha Waites, a former Atlanta City Councilwoman and ex-state representative, joins Peter Hubbard, a clean energy advocate, on Tuesday’s ballot. Waites was the frontrunner in the special primary election with a 16,110-vote advantage over Hubbard. Waites was just shy of the 50% vote threshold needed to avoid a runoff. 
Robert Jones and Daniel Blackman were also competitors vying for the District 3 seat last month. Jones received just over 20% of the vote, and Blackman’s votes were not counted after a residency-based disqualification. District 3 includes Clayton, DeKalb and Fulton counties. Commissioners are elected statewide but must live in the district they hope to represent. 
Tuesday’s runoff comes after a week of early voting where polls across the state saw a limited number of Georgians cast their ballots, with less than 33,000 cast ballots last week. 
With only a 0.4% turnout so far, underwhelming voter participation is expected to continue through election day. Critics have warned that low turnout could be costly for several counties across the state. The cost to hold the election could exceed $100 per voter, according to the Associated Press.
The runoff winner will face GOP incumbent Commissioner Fitz Johnson in November’s general election. Johnson was appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp in 2021. 
If the election stays on track this year, it will be the first time in years since voters have elected commissioners to the regulatory panel. The commission oversees utilities like Georgia Power and helps decide what Georgians pay for those services. 
A 2020 lawsuit argued that a statewide election for regional districts dilutes the voting strength of Black Georgians, noting that only one Black commissioner has ever been elected under that system. The lawsuit ultimately delayed regularly scheduled PSC elections and is currently pending with the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
Registered Georgia voters who did not cast Republican ballots in the June 17 primary are eligible to vote Tuesday through 7 p.m. Registration and polling place information can be checked at the Georgia Secretary of State’s My Voter Page.

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/07/15/supreme-court-clears-the-way-for-sweeping-cuts-at-education-department/,The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the Trump administration to make deep cuts to U.S. Department of Education personnel after it lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked the cuts.,"The Lyndon Baines Johnson Department of Education Building in Washington, D.C., in a file photo from November. (Photo by Shauneen Miranda/States Newsroom)The Supreme Court on Monday cleared the way for the Trump administration to make deep cuts to U.S. Department of Education personnel after it lifted lower court injunctions that had blocked the cuts.
The court granted the emergency relief sought by the administration without comment, as is typical in its orders.
But in a dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said the cuts — firing more than half the department’s staff — amounted to shutting down the agency by crippling its ability to do its job, a step that only Congress can take. She called the majority’s decision to lift the injunction “indefensible.”
“It hands the Executive the power to repeal statutes by firing all those necessary to carry them out,” wrote Sotomayor, who was joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. “The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive, but either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave.”
The Trump administration argued that its plan to slash staffing at the department fell within the president’s authority to streamline operations at executive agencies and eliminating “discretionary functions” that it thought were best left to the states.
Despite what critics claimed, the administration said it its emergency appeal to the Supreme Court that it “has been crystal clear in acknowledging that only Congress can eliminate the Department of Education,” and the planned cuts kept enough staff to “continue fulfilling statutorily mandated functions … [that] in its judgment, are necessary for those tasks.”

U.S. Education Secretary Linda McMahon welcomed the ruling, which she said allows the department to “carry out the reduction in force to promote efficiency and accountability and to ensure resources are directed where they matter most – to students, parents, and teachers.”
But Sen. Angela Alsobrooks (D-Maryland) called the court’s decision “disastrous.”
“It allows mass layoffs of the dedicated civil servants at the Department of Education and puts our children’s future in jeopardy,” Alsobrooks said in a text message. “The investments we make in education now impact the future of our country — we must keep fighting for our children to get the education they deserve.”
President Donald Trump (R) had campaigned on a promise of eliminating the department, and Secretary Linda McMahon called the job cuts the “first step on the road to total shutdown” of the department.
Those cuts, announced on March 11, “eliminated whole offices and teams within the Department” without notice, according to Sotomayor, and the more than 1,378 employees targeted were immediately denied access to their work files, prohibiting any handoff of responsibilities to the remaining workers.
The job cuts were quickly challenged by Democratic attorneys general Maryland and 19 other states —  Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin — as well as the District of Columbia.
A second lawsuit was subsequently filed by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts.
The two lawsuits were combined, and on May 22 U.S. District Judge Myong J. Joun of Massachusetts granted a preliminary injunction. Joun agreed with the plaintiffs that the action amounted to dismantling the department without congressional approval, violating the separation of powers.
He ordered the reinstatement of the fired workers and other efforts to return the department “to the status quo prior to January 20, 2025,” the date of Trump’s inauguration. He also prohibited Trump and McMahon from taking any actions to enact a March 20 Trump executive order on “Closing the Department of Education and Returning Authority to the States.”
The government appealed, but the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Joun’s order, saying the government had done little to defend itself. The prompted the emergency request that the Supreme Court granted Monday.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Maryland House Speaker Adrienne Jones (D-Baltimore County) said in a text message Monday evening that the ruling “to allow Trump to continue to gut the Department of Education is truly indefensible.”
“Working families — and particularly our Black and brown students — will suffer the most to benefit those who need it least,” Jones’ text said.
Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) noted the that majority did not explain its ruling, that he called a “cavalier and callous approach [that] represents a total disregard for our students and the public education system.”
Paul Lemle, president of the Maryland State Education Association, said in an emailed statement students who receive federal support for special education services, are multilingual learners, or come from “backgrounds of poverty” will hurt by the ruling.
“This is a deeply disappointing decision that will cause more chaos and make it harder for educators, parents, and students to get the support that they need and deserve,” his stement said. “This redoubles the importance of doing all we can in Maryland to strengthen and protect our commitment to our students.”
Sotomayor said the majority’s ruling clears the way for the administration to break the law.
“When the Executive publicly announces its intent to break the law, and then executes on that promise, it is the Judiciary’s duty to check that lawlessness, not expedite it,” she wrote. “Rather than maintain the status quo, however, this Court now intervenes, lifting the injunction and permitting the Government to proceed with dismantling the Department. That decision is indefensible.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/educationdepartment2-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-15 01:58:44.741034

(Photo by Danielle J. Brown/Maryland Matters)Baltimore’s federal delegation gathered in City Hall Monday to highlight progress on some of the city’s longest-running struggles, such as lowered crime rates, fewer vacant properties and reductions in overdose deaths.
But the successes were overshadowed by recognition that actions from the Trump administration could disrupt future progress in those areas.
“It’s great to be here with the best federal delegation in the country,” Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott told reporters after a meeting with some of Maryland’s top Democrats. “Especially right now as congressmen across the country are voting to raise costs and strip them of their basic rights and needs, and we are grateful to have this team fighting for us.”
The conversation was part of an annual check-in by members of Congress on how the city is faring and how the federal delegation can help further the city’s goals. Scott was joined by Sens. Chris Van Hollen and Angela Alsobrooks, both Democrats, and Reps. Kweisi Mfume (D-7th) and Johnny Olszewski (D-2nd).
Scott highlighted continuing declines in the city’s homicides and nonfatal gun injuries in recent years.  Recently, the mayor’s office announced that Baltimore has recorded a 22.7% decrease in homicides and a 19.6% decline in nonfatal shootings since last July.

Other crime statistics have also come down. Compared to last year, auto thefts have dropped 34%, robberies are down 22%, arson is down 10% and carjackings are down 15%, according to recent data from city officials.
“Today is not a cause for celebration – (it is) for recognition of where we are and where we have come and the work that remains for us to go further,” Scott said.
Scott also noted recent progress made on reducing the number of vacant properties throughout the city, noting there are now fewer than “13,000 vacant properties citywide … after two decades of being stuck at around 20,000.”
The members of Congress who joined him each praised Scott for his part in helping to make progress in those areas, but they warned that broad federal cuts and other decisions from the Trump administration pose a threat to those efforts.
“Baltimore is a strong, resilient and caring city,” Olszewski said. “And it is one of the many cities across this country that are deeply under attack by an administration who seems to relish heartless, cruel and often illegal activity in its assault on the people of this country.”
Olszewski referenced the recently approved budget reconciliation legislation that will usher in more than $1 trillion in cuts to Medicaid and food-assistance programs nationwide over the next 10 years.
Mfume added that those cuts will “affect all of us, but it’s particularly going to affect people here in Baltimore.”
“It’s going to affect children, small children, and pregnant mothers and others who are trying to feed their children — this is where I draw the line with this administration,” Mfume said. “We can’t punish children who are hungry because we don’t like the politics of the city or the people or the parents.”
Scott said that those cuts to Medicaid and other health-based programs could impede intervention efforts to help people struggling with addiction and overdoses, such as in the recent mass overdose event that occurred in Baltimore last week.
He said that investigations on what caused the mass overdose event that led to 27 people needing medical services to recover are still on going.
“All these cuts that are coming to Medicaid, to Medicare, all these things … it’s going to impact every single part of the medical system,” he said, “when you talk about treatment for addiction, behavioral health and substance abuse treatment, specifically.”

(File photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Ben Jealous, the former Maryland gubernatorial candidate turned Sierra Club executive director, is “on leave” from his post at the national environmental advocacy group.
The move comes after significant turmoil during Jealous’ tenure, which began in early 2023.
The Progressive Workers Union, which represents Sierra Club employees, has slammed Jealous for his management of the organization, citing several rounds of layoffs over the past few years, and other labor disputes. They argue he has placed the nonprofit on unsure footing at a time when President Donald Trump’s (R) administration is loosening environmental regulations and targeting clean-energy projects.
Jonathon Berman, a spokesperson for the Sierra Club, confirmed Jealous’s leave but declined to comment further, calling it a “personnel matter.” It remains unclear why Jealous is on leave or for how long he will be absent.
In an email sent to Sierra Club staff Friday, Michael Parrish, the club’s chief operating officer, said that a longtime Sierra Club higher-up, Loren Blackford, would serve as acting executive director in Jealous’ absence.
Erica Dodt, president of the Progressive Workers Union, cited recent layoffs in a news release Monday.
“When facing budget challenges, we have been told and believe that Jealous’ executive team increased its size and salaries all while laying off staff critical to Sierra Club’s success,” Dodt said.

	With Jealous on leave the union looks forward to “working with managers and the Sierra Club Board of Directors to right the ship, and to rebuild trust between the union, non-represented staff, and volunteers,” said Dylan Plummer, unit representative for the Sierra Club Unit of PWU.
The union issued a vote of “no confidence” in Jealous last year, and nonunionized Sierra Club managers and certain chapters took the same step.
Between January 2023 and April 2025, the union estimates that Sierra Club cut 97 staff positions. More recent announcements of upcoming layoffs would bring the total to 140, according to a June news release from the union, which represents 364 Sierra Club staff.
“The Sierra Club must be a strong leader against the Trump administration’s attempts to eliminate bedrock environmental policies and protections,” Plummer said. “It’s incomprehensible that the Sierra Club Board and executive leadership would again discard the very people who stand on the front lines every single day to carry out this work.”
Jealous, 52, was the Democratic nominee for governor in 2018, but lost overwhelmingly to incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan (R), despite running in a blue state. Hogan, who became only the second Republican governor in Maryland to win a second term, won 55.4% of the vote to Jealous’ 43.5% in the general election.
Before his run with the environmental organization, Jealous made a name for himself as a civil rights leader, serving as the youngest-ever president and CEO of the NAACP from 2008 to 2013. After his gubernatorial run, Jealous led the civil rights organization People For the American Way, beginning in 2020.
But the Progressive Workers Union has charged Jealous, the first person of color to lead the Sierra Club, with laying off disproportionate numbers of staffers of color during his tenure. A 2023 layoff was almost half “Black, Indigenous, People of Color,” according to PWU, though BIPOC staff were about 28% of the organization.
The union has also filed charges with the National Labor Relations Board, including one arguing that its bargaining team leaders were being targeted for layoffs because of their union activity amid contentious negotiations for a new contract.
“Ben Jealous’s tenure at the Sierra Club has been defined by unprecedented union busting, never-ending layoffs, and the demoralization of staff at the organization,” said CJ Garcia-Linz, a Sierra Club employee and former PWU President, in the June news release.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/IMG_3110-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-15 00:59:05.106347

(Photo by Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)Maryland joined 23 other states and the District of Columbia Monday in a lawsuit against the Trump administration, two weeks after the U.S. Department of Education abruptly froze $6.8 billion in funds for summer programs, adult learning and more.
The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the Education Department, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. It was sparked by a three-sentence June 30 email to states that said previously approved federal funds, due to be released the next day, were instead being held for review to ensure that they align with “the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”
The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multistate lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January.
They also say it comes at the worst possible time for school systems.
“This reckless funding freeze is directly harming Maryland’s students by taking more than $110 million from Maryland K–12 schools and adult education programs, which has jeopardized teacher training, thrown essential special needs services into chaos, and left families scrambling to find child care before the start of a new school year,” Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said in a statement on the suit.
“Maryland’s students are not pawns in political games over government spending — they need and deserve the educational resources that the Trump administration is threatening to cancel,” Brown said.
A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments were paused on June 30, the last day of fiscal 2025.
Federal freeze on funds could cost Maryland schools $125 million this year

The timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha said during a virtual news conference Monday with the attorneys general of California, Colorado, and ksuit.
“It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year … when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said.
The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. It also funded education for English-language learners and subsidized education for children of migrant workers.
Other states on the lawsuit are Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin, along with the District of Columbia.
The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement from the Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.”
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted Monday’s news conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration’s “little regard for the law.”
“In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said.
The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. A pair of court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.”
Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island’s case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state’s part-time legislature having just wrapped up its legislative session three weeks prior.
“It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state’s many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure.
But Neronha said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January.
Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green, who denounced the funding freeze at a July 9 news conference, said Monday that the funding freeze “harms Rhode Island’s students, families, and teachers.” The loss of $29 million in congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said.
“Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk.”
Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Democratic attorneys general. Neronha’s office has co-led or joined  26 lawsuits against the Trump administration since March. Maryland also has a hand in 26 suits, according to Brown’s office.
Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome.
“I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and I don’t obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record … we’ve seen this story before. We’ve been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we’ve had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.”

(Photo by Danielle E. Gaines/Maryland Matters)Maryland Gov. Wes Moore (D) has tapped a Republican Carroll County commissioner and former Fort Meade commander to be the next head of the Department of Veterans and Military Families.
Ed Rothstein takes over as secretary on Aug. 1 from Acting Secretary Ross Cohen, who has been serving since the May departure of former Secretary Anthony C. “Tony” Woods.
Moore said in statement announcing the appiontment that Rothstein “has dedicated his career to serving this country and the people of Maryland,” and that he was honored Rothstein stepped forward to be the next secretary of Veterans and Military Families.
“Ed’s track record as a distinguished Army veteran and a devoted public servant demonstrates his commitment to live mission first, people always. During this next critical phase of our work, he will help lead our efforts to build a state that is safer, more affordable, more competitive – and one that leaves no one behind.”

Moore also thanked Cohen for stepping up to serve as acting secretary during the interim. Cohen is expected to return to his previous role as deputy secretary once Rothstein comes on board, Moore said.
Rothstein’s appointment drew praise from local and federal officials.
“He is a mission-driven strong leader who puts people first over bureaucracy,” former U.S. Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D) said in a statement. “Having served in the military for over 30 years, he knows military life and its impact on families. In my experience he knows how to make the policy and projects to ensure our military and veterans have what they need to lead their best lives.”
In addition to his assignment as a military intelligence officer, Rothstein served two years as garrison commander at Fort Meade.
“Ed Rothstein’s background to include his service to both this nation and Maryland make him the quintessential secretary to lead DVMF forward, serving Maryland veterans and families,” Del. Mike Rogers (D-Anne Arundel) said in a statement.
Following his departure from the military, Rothstein was president and CEO of the Anne Arundel County Economic Development Corporation. Later he was the executive director of the BWI Partnership.
Rothstein was elected to the Carroll County Board of Commissioners in 2018 and re-elected in 2022.
Carroll County Administrator Roberta Windham praised the appointment in a statement.
“His dedication to veterans and his passion for service is evident in everything he does. Carroll County’s Commissioners and I wish him all the best in his new role,” Windham said.
If confirmed by the Senate next year, Rothstein would become Moore’s second secretary for the agency, after Woods, who left the job in May to take a position with a private-sector technology startup.

(Photo by Aristide Economopoulos/New Jersey Monitor)The Trump administration has agreed to not distribute devices that turn semiautomatic rifles into machine guns in Maryland and 15 other states where they are illegal under state law.
Maryland led the lawsuit last month against the administration plan to return nearly 12,000 previously confiscated devices like forced-reset triggers installed on rifles that allow them to shoot up to 900 rounds per minute.
The planned return of the devices followed a federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives settlement of a Biden-era lawsuit that claimed forced-reset were illegal. But in a court filing late last month, after the states sued, the ATF agreed it would not directly return the triggers to their owners in states where they’re illegal.
“It is unfortunate that litigation was necessary when the federal government could have made these commitments much earlier,” Washington Attorney General Nick Brown said in a statement Friday. “But I will do everything possible to keep Washingtonians safe from dangerous machine-gun conversion devices.”
Maryland Attorney General Anthony Brown said that when the states filed their suit, in U.S. District Court for Maryland, his office “warned that thousands of forced reset triggers would flood our streets and leave Marylanders vulnerable to more senseless gun violence.”
Maryland gets one court win, joins two more suits against Trump administration

“Our case led the federal government to block their redistribution into Maryland and other states where they’re banned,” Brown said in a statement Friday. “This victory protects Maryland families from the devastation these dangerous devices have been used to inflict in our communities.”
The other states on the lawsuit were California, Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont. The District of Columbia is also a plaintiff. Most of the states have laws banning forced reset triggers.
They argued the proliferation of these conversion devices in recent years has led to an increase in crimes committed with machine guns.
The Biden administration filed lawsuits against manufacturers and gun sellers and seized the devices from gun stores and individuals. The administration decided forced reset triggers were basically machine guns that are prohibited under federal law.
But last year, a federal judge in Texas disagreed, and ordered the Biden administration to return some of the conversion devices. The administration was complying but declined to send the triggers back to states where they’re illegal.
President Donald Trump accelerated that work, settling with manufacturers and agreeing to return the seized or surrendered devices to their owners across the country, including those convicted of felonies, the states’ lawsuit filed last month noted.
The states argued this would lead to more gun violence and force them to expend resources to confiscate the devices again. This would result in added costs for police and health care. Gun violence killed 737 Marylanders in 2023, according to federal data.
In a court filing, an ATF official wrote that there would be two notices for device owners. One will go to those in states where forced reset triggers are legal explaining how to get them returned.
The second, for those in states like Washington where they’re illegal, will give owners three options. They could request the ATF make the transfer to them in a state where it’s legal, request transfer to a third-party in a legal state or abandon the device. If an owner does not want a device returned, the federal government would destroy it.

The triggers also won’t be returned to people prohibited from possessing firearms.
Rare Breed Triggers, a main manufacturer and seller of forced reset triggers, also committed in court papers not to sell or ship its returned products into states where they’re illegal. The company’s president estimated the ATF took custody of at least $2.5 million worth of Rare Breed products.
Because of these commitments, on Friday, the states dropped their request in Maryland federal court for a preliminary injunction blocking the Trump administration’s return plans.

It doesn’t always look like force or desperation. Anyone can be a victim.,"When sex trafficking charges were brought against Sean “Diddy” Combs, it marked a rare and significant moment. Many advocates saw it as a step forward that prosecutors were willing to pursue trafficking charges—a move that’s still uncommon when there’s a romantic relationship involved.
Ultimately, the jury did not convict him on sex trafficking. They did, however, convict him under the Mann Act—a law related to transporting someone for commercial sex. While we don’t know exactly what the jury wrestled with, many legal experts believe the challenge came down to proving force, fraud, or coercion beyond a reasonable doubt. Especially when the survivor had a relationship with the perpetrator.
And that’s why I feel compelled to say this: The Diddy trial—and others like it before—have stirred up a lot of thoughts for me. And maybe for some of you, too. What strikes me most is that this basic truth still isn’t understood by everyone: 
You don’t have to be kicking and screaming (literally or metaphorically) to be a victim.
You can feel affection for the person who’s victimizing you. You can be in a relationship with them. You can even (believe you) love them. That doesn’t make the harm okay. It doesn’t make it any less of a crime.
In my daily work at Love146, an organization dedicated to ending child trafficking and supporting survivors, I know that most of the youth we serve in our Survivor Care have been victimized by someone they knew. Oftentimes by someone they trusted. And yes, sometimes even by someone they loved.
The presence of affection or consent at moments does not mean the whole story is clear of abusive and criminal components. And consent for some actions does not imply universal consent for all of them.
If you’re reading this and that feels obvious, I’m glad. It means we have a foundation in society (you!) to build on. At Love146, I’ve learned that this basic fact — that not all victimization is a situation of unceasing physical force — is obvious to most people when it comes to toddlers and young children. But do we understand it for all survivors?
I was victimized before starting kindergarten (my own experience wasn’t trafficking, but it was abuse). And even for that circumstance, the lie that I “didn’t fight back enough” has had power. The shame of not resisting more. The fear that I was complicit. Those are the lies many survivors carry.
So yes, we tend to get this when the child is five, six, eight. But do we get it when the victim is a teen? Do we understand this for adults? For boys and men?
Anyone can be a victim.
Victimization doesn’t always look how we think it will. It doesn’t always look like force or desperation. Survival often means trying to manage what feels inevitable. And deciding how to manage that can depend on whether someone believes you—whether they’ll understand that it wasn’t okay and if they’ll back you up.
If we want a better world, we have to grow in our understanding. I believe we can.
And to survivors reading this—especially those whose perpetrators weren’t tried or convicted, or were convicted of lesser charges: that verdict doesn’t define what happened to you.
Cassie and Jane Doe both testified for multiple days, sharing painful and detailed accounts. So many youth in Love146’s Survivor Care have opened up in ways that cost them dearly—emotionally, socially, and legally—only to watch their experience be minimized.
You know your story. You know what happened, and your experience is real, whether or not a courtroom called it trafficking.
We see you. We believe you. And we will keep walking forward, together.

Rebecca Woods, University of Toronto

In just the last several months, de-extinction — bringing back extinct species by recreating them or organisms that resemble them — has moved closer from science fiction to science fact. Colossal Biosciences — an American for-profit de-extinction startup headed by geneticists George Church and Beth Shapiro — announced two major achievements almost back-to-back.
In the first, scientists spliced part of the woolly mammoth’s genome into mice to create “woolly mice,” incredibly cute pom-pom like rodents sporting coats that express the genes of long-extinct woolly mammoths.

Just a few weeks later, Colossal announced an even bigger achievement, claiming to have brought back the dire wolf, a contemporary of the woolly mammoth who, like their Ice Age proboscidean co-travellers, last roamed the Earth roughly 10,000 years ago.
Mammoth popularity
Woolly mammoths are at the forefront of these controversial de-extinction efforts. Despite a deep bench of more recently extinct species — the dodo, the moa, passenger pigeons, the bucardo, quagga, thylacine, aurochs and a whole host of others — readily available to take centre stage in de-extinction efforts, woolly mammoths figure prominently in de-extinction stories, both scientific and popular.
Woolly mammoths featured prominently in the imagery of Revive & Restore, a “genetic rescue” conglomerate of scientists and futurists headed by tech-guru Steward Brand; in 2021, Colossal “established ownership” over woolly mammoth revival. Colossal’s own logo visualizes CRISP-R, the gene-splicing technology that facilitates de-extinction, and the signature spiralled tusks of Mammuthus primigenius.
In popular culture, woolly mammoths have been a source of fascination for the last several centuries. Thomas Jefferson famously held out hope that live mammoths would be found beyond the frontier of American colonialism in the late-1700s, while early excavations of American mastodons were major events in the early 1800s. American painter Charles Willson Peale captured the first such excavation in oils, and later capitalized on that mastadon’s skeleton in his Philadelphia museum.
More recently, Manny the mammoth featured in the ongoing Ice Age animated film franchise, first launched in 2002.
Climate icons
At the same time, woolly mammoths have also become an emblem of the contemporary climate crisis. During the recent wave of defacing famous artwork in order to draw attention to the climate crisis, environmental activists painted the (fortunately artificial) tusks of the Royal B.C. Museum’s woolly mammoth model bright pink.
In a 2023 publicity stunt, the Australian cultured-meat startup, Vow, unveiled a mammoth meatball produced out of the woolly mammoth’s genome with sheep DNA as filler. Not for sale, the mammoth meatball was scorched before an audience at the Dutch science museum, Nemo.
The stunt was intended to call attention, again, to the plight of the Earth’s climate, the unsustainability of industrialized food systems and the potential for lab-grown meat to square this particular circle.
Model animals
For a creature that no human being has ever seen live and in the flesh, woolly mammoths certainly get a lot of media exposure. How did this long-extinct species become the emblem of contemporary extinction and de-extinction?
People have been interacting with the remains of woolly mammoths for hundreds of years. Dig a hole deep enough almost anywhere in the northern hemisphere, and you are apt to come across the bones or maybe the tusks of extinct mammoths or mastodons.
In early modern Europe, mammoth fossils were famously interpreted as the bones of unicorns and giants before being recognized as belonging to elephant-like creatures around 1700. Only around 1800 were mammoths recognized as a distinct and extinct species of proboscidea.
Elsewhere in Arctic regions, especially Siberia, Indigenous Peoples were familiar with mammoth remains preserved by permafrost. As rivers and their tributaries surged during annual thaws, whole carcasses of mammoths (and woolly rhinos) were sometimes exposed.
Local peoples who came across these remains, apparently recently dead but belonging to creatures they never saw walking the Earth’s surface, surmised that they were great burrowing rodent-like animals that tunnelled through the ground and perished if they accidentally came into contact with atmosphere.
Around the Arctic, including in Alaska, permafrost prevented the fossilization of mammoth tusks as well as bodies, and this ice ivory was — and remains — an important element of Arctic economies, carved locally and exchanged into historically regional, and now global, markets.
Continued relevance
Despite their association with the distant past, woolly mammoths have long resonated with modern human cultures as their fossilized or preserved body parts entered economic practices and knowledge systems alike. But as the extinction of once numerous species like the passenger pigeon, the American bison and African elephant began to loom over the late 19th century, woolly mammoths took on new meanings in the context of modern extinction and emergent understandings of human evolution.

	Revolutions in geology, archeology, paleontology and related disciplines were changing long-held assumptions about the origin of humankind.
Narratives of the rise of “man the hunter” arose in natural history institutions such as the American Museum of Natural History and the Field Museum in Chicago. These origin stories were explicitly connected to the presumed extinction of woolly mammoths and their evolutionary relatives, the mastodons.
These led to some of the most powerful expressions of mammoths in visual form, like the frescoes and paintings produced by renowned paleoartist Charles R. Knight.
At the same time, cave paintings in France, Spain and elsewhere came to light in the early 20th century. For example, the 40,000-year-old frescoes at Rouffignac, France clearly depicting woolly mammoths were interpreted as further evidence of this deep and powerful historical connection.
It is this connection — the association of the rise of modern humankind with the decline and extinction of the woolly mammoth — that feeds today’s continued fascination. Notions of human complicity in extinction stories have long been embedded in modern scientific understandings of woolly mammoths. It is no accident that woolly mammoths are so central to de-extinction projects and climate activism alike.

(Photo by Jake Goldstein-Street/Washington State Standard)The Trump administration must allow refugees to enter the United States from countries covered by the president’s travel ban, a federal judge in Seattle ruled Monday.
U.S. District Court Judge Jamal Whitehead’s decision opens the door for around 80 refugees to immediately arrive from countries whose citizens are banned from traveling here. 
Whitehead also ruled the Trump administration needs to potentially allow refugees to enter the United States even if their planned travel was postponed before the president took office. 
Affected individuals and resettlement organizations, including Lutheran Community Services Northwest in Tacoma, brought the lawsuit after President Donald Trump halted refugee admissions via executive order on his first day in office.
In February, Whitehead, a Biden appointee, ruled the president’s order likely “crossed the line” of separation of powers. 
But the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals later narrowed Whitehead’s ruling to only allow the entry of refugees whose applications were approved before Trump signed the executive order. For refugees to enter the country under the appeals court ruling, they also needed clearance from U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and travel plans arranged at the time Trump issued his ban on refugee admissions. 
That decision from a three-judge 9th Circuit panel didn’t stop Trump from otherwise halting the United States Refugee Admissions Program.
Whitehead ordered the federal government to facilitate entry for refugees who met the appeals court’s three-prong test and had travel scheduled within two weeks of Trump’s order. The feds reported 160 people met those criteria. 
Magistrate Judge Michelle Peterson, of Seattle, will review the cases of others whose scheduled arrival date was after Feb. 3. This includes more than 4,000 cases comprising upward of 12,000 potential refugees.
The question before the district court was whether the Trump administration still needed to admit refugees from countries targeted in Trump’s early June travel ban. Refugees from these countries make up two-thirds of those who met the appeals court’s criteria but haven’t been admitted to the U.S. yet. 
One of the plaintiffs in the litigation is a Bellevue woman who filed an application to sponsor a refugee family from Afghanistan before the federal government suspended their case. Afghanistan is included in the president’s travel ban.
The organizations involved in the case also fear the Trump administration is undercounting the number of impacted refugees. They say the federal government isn’t including people whose travel plans were postponed for reasons other than the refugee ban, like application processing delays. And some plans may have been canceled in anticipation of the president’s actions.
The Trump administration countered in court documents that those refugees aren’t covered by the appeals court’s order. Department of Justice attorney Joseph McCarter called the request a “baseless and unrestrained expansion” of the ruling.
Whitehead ruled refugees whose travel plans were canceled between Dec. 1 and Jan. 20 are also covered by his order, paving a path for more to arrive in the United States. 
Within a week from Monday, the federal government must identify all cases meeting the appellate court’s three-part test, Whitehead ordered.
The government must also expedite the entry of unaccompanied refugee children and Afghan refugees temporarily staying at a camp in Qatar.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/refugee-resettlement-injunction-hearing-2048x1536-2-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 23:00:08.135341

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Josh Shapiro speaks to reporters Monday, July 14, 2025, before the state House voted on a budget bill. (Peter Hall/Capital-Star)Two weeks after the state budget deadline, lawmakers and Gov. Josh Shapiro said they’ve made progress in negotiations as the Democratic-controlled House advanced a $50.6 billion proposal to the GOP-led Senate.
It represents about a $900 million reduction in overall spending compared to Shapiro’s $51.5 billion proposal in February, but Republican House leaders said the bill is a largely procedural document and that more work remains to be done.
“This is not agreed to, but we are pleased that talks are continuing, moving in a direction that while it may seem slow and in fact is slow and frustrating for many of us, we do believe that there is some positive momentum,” House Minority Leader Jesse Topper (R-Bedford) said.
The Democratic majority’s lead budget negotiator, Appropriations Committee Chair Jordan Harris (D-Philadelphia), said lawmakers owed their constituents progress.
“The folks have already waited too long,” Harris said, noting that school districts across the commonwealth were forced to pass their budgets without knowing how much state funding they will get. “It is our responsibility to take a step forward, to show them that we’re not only working, but that we are ready to do what is necessary to get them a spending plan.”
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The general appropriations bill passed the House in a 105-97 vote with the support of Republican Reps. Thomas Mehaffie of Dauphin County, Kathleen Tomlinson of Bucks County, and Craig Williams of Delaware County.
A spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Joe Pittman (R-Indiana) echoed the House Republicans’ view that the vote was primarily procedural and said the bill is not “a finished product.”
“Senator Pittman remains very upbeat and is actively engaged in discussions, however there is still much work to do,” spokesperson Kate Flessner said.
After meeting with House Democrats, Shapiro told reporters he had met Pittman and House Majority Leader Matt Bradford (D-Montgomery) and said they had made good progress. He repeatedly declined to discuss specifics of the negotiations or how long it would take to reach a final agreement. 
“We all have an understanding of where we need to be on an overall spend, where we can make important investments we all want to make and also be cognizant of our fiscal situation,” Shapiro said.
Asked whether Democrats and Republicans had reached agreements on new revenue proposals, which include taxes on legal recreational marijuana and slot machine-like skill games, Topper demurred, saying his caucus is focused on strengthening the state’s economy.

“We’ve made it very clear that even if we didn’t increase spending a dime moving forward, our budgets in the future are unsustainable without economic growth,” he said.
According to a spreadsheet provided by Harris’ office, the House proposal makes cuts to line items throughout the budget while increasing spending on priorities such as K-12 education, the state university system, the Department of Transportation and state police. 
It also would increase Department of Human Services funding by nearly $4.5 billion in the face of federal cuts to Medicaid, which Shapiro said could devastate rural hospitals and nursing homes. The state would be unable to make up the loss in Medicaid funding.
The state Department of Human Services says cuts could result in more than 310,000 Pennsylvanians losing Medicaid coverage over the next decade. Some 270,000 could lose access to marketplace plans or face steep premium increases.
The House proposal would also increase public education funding by $930 million. The General Assembly last year committed to closing what it had identified as a $4.5 billion “adequacy gap” between the state’s wealthiest and highest performing school districts and about 370 under-funded districts.
The Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education would receive a $40.4 million increase, about 6.5% more than last year’s budget. The Department of Environmental Protection would get a $130 million funding increase, or about 5.1% over last year.
The state police would see a $118 million increase. The proposal also includes a $16.3 million increase or 6.5% increase for PennDOT. Shapiro’s budget proposal called to continue a process of reducing the amount of fuel tax and license fees dedicated to the state police to make more money available for highways. That money is not reflected in the general appropriations bill.

The House also passed legislation to increase funding for public transportation by nearly $300 million by increasing the share of state sales tax dedicated to the state’s transportation trust fund. That money is also not reflected in the bill passed Monday.
Departments that would see an overall reduction in funding include: 

The governor’s office at $41 million or 7.4%
Agriculture at $5.9 million or 1.6%Drug and Alcohol Programs by $1.6 million or 0.4%
General Services at $16.1 million or 9%

But, he has always steered clear of what sits just below it: the trailhead of one of the most popular, yet challenging hikes in the Pocono Mountains — Glen Onoko Falls trail. 
While tourists and locals have attempted and completed the hike, others like Bogin have avoided its 800 foot cliff along a series of waterfalls. “It was never safe,” even before they closed it down, he said. 
Glen Onoko has a reputation around Carbon County for its majestic views and steep incline, which draw experienced and inexperienced hikers alike. But, the trail frequently overwhelmed county emergency medical service agencies, who are largely staffed by volunteers.
  Neil Bogin said he’s steered clear of the Glen Onoko Falls trail because it’s not safe. (Elena Eisenstadt/Captial-Star)
On any given day, upwards of 50 volunteers would go to rescue people on the mountain.  Even after it was closed in 2019, some people continued walking the trail. In one instance in 2022,  a 72-year-old woman died. Rep. Doyle Heffley, (R-Carbon) said rescue missions have proven dangerous for emergency responders, as well as hikers stuck on the trail.
Now, Pennsylvania is one step closer to reopening the Glen Onoko Falls Trail after Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a bill in late June to incorporate the trail into Lehigh Gorge State Park. While the move provides the necessary land to the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources (DCNR), funding in the state’s 2025-26 budget will ultimately determine the specific plans to improve the trail. 
“After a planning process and improvements, DCNR would reopen the Glen Onoko Falls Trail, increasing safe access to waterfalls and scenic views,” Wesley Robinson, DCNR press secretary, wrote in a statement to the Capital-Star.
The Pennsylvania Game Commission controlled the property, but the measure finalizes a land transfer to DCNR, which has more leeway to secure and maintain the trail.
As a result of this year’s land conveyance bill, the DCNR will transfer roughly 368 acres of land in Lehigh Township, Carbon County, to the Game Commission, in exchange for 495 acres of land that includes Glen Onoko in Nesquehoning Borough and Lehigh Township, Carbon County.
The Game Commission wrote in an April statement that it was unable to improve or reopen the trail, since its focus is on wildlife management and not natural resource management.
The land swap is fruitful for both parties, according to the agency, since the property that the commission will receive in exchange will offer better hunting opportunities than the steep land around Glen Onoko.

The community of Jim Thorpe has gained a reputation for its old-world charm and easy access to outdoor activities and people in the town are cautiously optimistic about the possibility of Glen Onoko Falls reopening. Shop owners and tourism advocates are looking forward to the economic gains, while they also stress the need for safety measures, given its grave history.
Neil Bogin, who has lived in Jim Thorpe for 20 years, is also excited about the potential reopening, but only, he said, “if it’s done right.”
Investing in tourism through state parks has been a priority for Shapiro throughout his first term as governor. His proposed 2025-2026 state budget includes $5 million in new funding for expanding and improving public lands, including Glen Onoko.

DCNR spokesperson Wesley Robinson declined to comment further about how the budget impasse will affect the proposed funding.
Pennsylvania’s outdoor recreation industry provided nearly $19 billion to the state’s economy in 2023, representing a two percent share of its gross domestic product, according to 2023 data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. The industry sustains more than 168,000 jobs, which provide nearly $9 billion in salaries, according to the analysis. 
Outdoor recreational tourism has a significant impact on Carbon County alone, since it accounts for nearly 12% of the Pocono’s annual 30 million tourists visiting the area, according to Chris Barron, president of the Pocono Mountains Visitors Bureau.
Glen Onoko first became a popular tourist destination in the 1800s, when the Lehigh Valley Railroad offered train service to the falls. The Wahnetah Hotel — originally known as the Glen Onoko Tavern — provided a popular summer vacation spot nearby.
After decades as a quiet coal shipping community, Jim Thorpe, the closest neighboring town to Glen Onoko, began to see another tourism boom after the 1980s, said Beth Beers, owner of Everything Nice Gift Shop, which has been open for 40 years.

Beers has seen tourism reshape Jim Thorpe over the decades. She remembers how most of Broadway, the main thoroughfare in town, was boarded up and empty. Now, tourism supports the economy with many mom-and-pop shops, like her own, she said.
Jim Thorpe has been chasing the tourism industry for decades. In 1954, the town renamed itself from Mauch Chunk to Jim Thorpe after the legendary Native American athlete who was laid to rest in the community with the hope of attracting more visitors.Thorpe, originally of the Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma, was sent to the Carlisle Indians Industrial School, which was designed to assimilate Native American children into society. According to the National Park Service, its mission was to “kill the Indian” to “save the Man.” A 2010 lawsuit challenged his burial site, arguing that his remains should have been returned to the Sac and Fox Nation.
Despite the economic benefit of outdoor tourism in the area, Glen Onoko’s natural gems have become off-limits in recent years because of the safety risks they pose.
“It’s been a major issue for quite some time. It’s a wonderful piece of property, and many people hike it,” Rep. Heffley said during the land conveyance bill’s final passage on the House floor in late June.
Heffley told the House about one incident where two people had died falling off the falls, but there were only enough EMS volunteers to recover one body. Another crew went back the next day for the second one.

“It got to the point where people were leaving the first responder service, because every weekend they would spend their whole weekend up there at this trail,” he said.
According to Heffley, the land transfer will allow more and safer access to the facility, which will in turn promote local tourism and relieve a burden on volunteer first responders.
“What we want to do is take this property, which is a liability right now to the Game  Commission, a liability to the residents in Carbon County, and turn it into an asset,” he said.
Shop owners and tourism advocates agree.
Brooke Lenker, executive director of the Keystone Trails Association, agrees. “Reopening a trail brings people, which brings dollars nearby,” she said.
James Lambert, assistant manager at Pocono Biking, says he thinks more people would visit if they had the chance to hike Glen Onoko. Even in its disrepair, “we definitely get people [who] ask about the trail and don’t even know it’s closed yet,” he said.
But from experience, he also knows it’s not an easy hike. “It’s sketchy,” Lambert said. “There’s definitely some parts that an experienced hiker is gonna have to really take their time and, like, work for it, but the views on it are awesome.”
According to Karen Bly, general manager of the Broadway Grille and Pub in Jim Thorpe, far too many amateur hikers attempt Glen Onoko without proper training or gear, she said.
If it did reopen, Bly hopes to see a park ranger stationed near the trail and a canteen to rent or buy gear at the base of the hike, borrowing an idea from some of the national parks she’s visited out west.

Josh Shapiro announced his administration has filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) over its cancellation of millions of dollars in federal funding to farmers who supply food banks throughout the state.

Speaking at the Share Food Program in Philadelphia, the Governor was joined by Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding and local farmers to announce the legal challenge and reaffirm his Administration’s commitment to defending Pennsylvania’s agricultural producers and ensuring continued access to healthy food for families in need.Two weeks after the Trump administration decided to pause $230 million in congressionally-approved funding for Pennsylvania’s schools, Gov. Josh Shapiro has joined a lawsuit to challenge the move.
Along with Pennsylvania, 24 states and the District of Columbia are challenging what they call the federal government’s unlawful withholding of funding for after-school programs, teacher training, literacy, and education for migrant and non-English speaking students.
“Every Pennsylvania child deserves the freedom to chart their own course and the opportunity to succeed,” Shapiro said. “Once again, the Trump Administration is trying to take away dollars that were committed to Pennsylvania — this time from our schools.”
The announcement came one day before the money was supposed to be made available to schools on July 1.

There was no advance warning, according to Shapiro’s office. It also occurred days after the deadline for school districts in the commonwealth to approve their budgets.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the Education Department wrote to states. The notice did not provide any timeline — noting the funds are under review.
A total of $7 billion in funding earmarked for seven federal programs  is being withheld from schools across the country.
Pennsylvania’s share – $230 million – ranks sixth among the states after California, Texas, New York, Florida and Illinois, according to an analysis by Education Week.
The state Education Department estimated the impact on commonwealth schools and other organizations that expected to receive the funds:

Title I-C, Migrant Education: $11 million
Title II-A, Supporting Effective Instruction: $70 million
Title III-A, English Language Acquisition: $20 million
Title IV-B, 21st Century Community Learning Centers: $54 million
Adult Education Basic Grants to States: $20 million

The federal dollars normally would go toward programs that benefit children affected by poverty through summer school and after-school tutoring and enrichment programs; immigrant students and English learners, children of migrant workers; youth in the foster care system and juvenile justice system; and adults seeking basic education as a pathway to post-secondary education and employment, according to the Shapiro administration.
Other states joining the lawsuit California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin, as well as Washington, D.C.
NC Newsline reports North Carolina joined the suit because it was out $165 million.
“Congress created these programs and authorized this funding,” North Carolina Attorney General Jeff Jackson said. “The Department of Education does not have the authority to now withhold those funds, certainly not the night before they were set to arrive.”

Nicole Mitchell’s trial began on Monday July 14, 2025, in Detroit Lakes, Minnesota, at the Becker County District Courthouse. (Photo by Jerry Holt/Minnesota Star Tribune pool photo.)DETROIT LAKES — During jury selection for the felony burglary trial of Sen. Nicole Mitchell, DFL-Woodbury, the Becker County prosecutor asked just a few questions of the 23 potential jurors as he sought to forecast who might be most receptive to his arguments.
Among them: “Would you agree that how the person was dressed is relevant to their intentions?” Brian McDonald asked. Many of the potential jurors nodded.
On the night she was arrested at her stepmother’s home for an alleged botched burglary, Mitchell was dressed in black clothing and a black hat, police say.
The detailed questions from McDonald — and Mitchell’s attorney Bruce Ringstrom, Jr. — underscored the importance both sides place on jury selection, which can often determine the outcome of a case before it even starts.
First, though, Seventh Judicial District Chief Judge Michael Fritz, presiding over the first floor courtroom, sought to determine if the prospective jurors could rule fairly.
In a move befitting a case that’s been widely covered across the state, Fritz asked the prospective jurors to raise their hands if they have heard of the case against Mitchell. Of the 23 prospective jurors sitting in the jury box who were being questioned, 15 raised their hands in the affirmative.
The case has garnered statewide media coverage since Mitchell’s arrest in April 22, 2024, after police say they found her in the basement of her stepmother’s Detroit Lakes home at about 4:45 a.m. Police say she told them during her arrest that she was attempting to retrieve some of her late father’s possessions, including his ashes, according to the amended criminal complaint.
Fritz conducted his own questioning to determine what the potential jurors had heard of the case and whether that would bias them for or against Mitchell. Fritz called each of the 15 jurors who raised their hands into the courtroom to face individual questioning, asking whether they could issue a verdict based on evidence in the case, not what they’ve watched on the news or read on social media.
“You understand that the news isn’t evidence and you understand you must rule based on what you hear in trial?” Fritz asked each of the 15 jurors. All said they understood, and they could do that.
“It’s been on the news a lot,” one juror told the judge.
Ringstrom, Mitchell’s attorney, asked in a follow-up question whether the juror believed Mitchell could receive a fair trial in Becker County or whether she would hold it against the defense that they didn’t attempt to move the trial.
“Given the news coverage, I’m not sure anywhere in Minnesota would be better than Becker County,” she responded.
The trial could test jurors’ ability to set aside partisan identities. Mitchell, a suburban Democrat, is being tried in a county that went for President Donald Trump last year by 33 percentage points.
Ringstrom spent nearly four hours questioning the jurors. He asked whether they’ve been the victim of a burglary, what burglary meant to them and whether they knew anyone with dementia or Alzheimer’s.
The defense plans to argue that Carol Mitchell, Nicole Mitchell’s stepmother, has a deteriorating memory and is an unreliable witness. In the days following her arrest, Nicole Mitchell said she drove up to Detroit Lakes to conduct a welfare check on Carol Mitchell, but she startled her stepmother, who she says has Alzheimer’s and related paranoia.
“Have you ever had the experience of someone very convinced of a memory that wasn’t true?” Ringstrom asked one juror who said she worked with dementia patients.
He also asked whether the prospective jurors would look unfavorably upon Ringstrom if he aggressively cross-examined a person who “does have or probably does have dementia,” alluding to the fact that he intends to ask tough questions of Carol Mitchell and her memory of the alleged break-in.
“I’m afraid you’re going to hold it against Nicole Mitchell if I ask questions too aggressively,” Ringstrom told the prospective jurors. Multiple prospective jurors said that it depends on the circumstances.
During the questioning, Ringstrom asked the jurors to raise their hand to indicate whether they believe politicians should be held to a higher standard compared to regular citizens.
“Is there any reason that someone facing a criminal accusation should have a higher burden on them if they’re a politician rather than a citizen facing the same charge?” Ringstrom asked.
Multiple jurors said “no,” and that they believe the law should apply to everyone uniformly.
McDonald, the Becker County Attorney asked the potential jurors fewer questions, including whether anyone had been involved in a disagreement over an inheritance.
Roderick Mitchell, Nicole Mitchell’s father, died without a will in 2023, according to the criminal complaint. A probate court awarded Carol Mitchell 100% of Roderick Mitchell’s estate.
McDonald, building upon Ringstrom’s questioning about whether politicians should be held to a higher standard, asked the jurors whether they believed lawyers were in a better position to know the law. Multiple jurors nodded their heads.
This is relevant because Nicole Mitchell herself is an attorney. McDonald asked jurors whether the time or day or night is relevant as to why a person allegedly broke into a home. Multiple jurors said yes.
Finally, he asked about Mitchell’s black garb, which internet cutups have compared to that of a cat burglar.
At the end of the day Monday, the prosecution and defense seated 15 jurors — 10 men and five women. Only 12 jurors are going to deliberate a verdict; the remaining three are alternates.
Mitchell has pleaded not guilty to first-degree burglary and possession of burglary tools. If convicted, Mitchell faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. If found guilty of possession of burglary tools she faces a maximum sentence of three years in prison.

According to Curt Lindberg, chair of the Waitsfield Conservation Commission, the project spans a cumulative 260 worksites across the region.

MAD RIVER VALLEY — For the past seven years, volunteers have been pulling and clipping Japanese knotweed from riverbanks, open fields, roadsides and plenty of places in between.
They’re part of a joint effort between conservation commissions in three towns — Waitsfield, Warren and Fayston — to fight the invasive plant, which has taken hold along the Mad River Valley.
More recently, project leaders have enlisted a helping hoof: goats that can eat the knotweed up.    
Goat grazing is a known method to control invasive plants without machinery. Goats feed on the plants, weakening or killing them entirely. In 2024, the Mad River Valley effort hired Mary Beth Herbert to do the job. This year, she’s funded by a grant from the Lake Champlain Basin Program.

According to Curt Lindberg, chair of the Waitsfield Conservation Commission, the project spans a cumulative 260 worksites across the region. Interns from the University of Vermont as well as local volunteers have been working, along with the goats, to control knotweed across the locations.
Herbert got her start with keeping goats in 2018 while working as a trail crew leader on the Appalachian Trail in the south of the state. She got interested in working with goats because of frequent machine failures on the job that set the crew behind.
She spent around five years camping on the trail with her goats, half the time as a volunteer, the other half paid.
In the same year she and her three goats — Ruth, Bader and Ginsberg, after the former U.S. Supreme Court justice — were hired by the city of Montpelier to remove poison ivy.
In the winter of 2023, Herbert gave away her then 23-strong herd and moved to Arizona to study with Navajo shepherds.

That spring, she was contacted by the Mad River knotweed operation to help rid the area of the invasive.
When efforts to remove knotweed first started out, locals found it challenging and had thought, “‘Why even bother,’” said Lindberg.
But in the past few years there has been a shift in perspective.
“With good persistent effort, you can make progress,” Lindberg said.
This year, Herbert has a herd of 18 goats, 14 of which she owns and four she has rented from Villa Villekulla Farm in Barnard.
The knotweed is extensive and dense, especially along the river.
On a recent day near the Mad River Exchange in Waitsfield, Herbert walked along a wooded trail toward the riverside clearing where her crew has been stationed this summer. Unlike the land around it, the field hasn’t been overwhelmed by knotweed; the patches are shorter and more spread out.

She’s been rotating the herd around the perimeter to prevent the invasive from growing any further.   
“I already see a difference from last year to this year,” she said.
Around the field, knotweed grazed on four weeks ago had grown back to chest height while further away, ungrazed plants stood at least 6 feet high. 
Unlike poison ivy, which can be grazed heavily one time, Knotweed needs more regular maintenance to suppress the spread. 
“Knotweed needs to be grazed many, many times, over and over,” Herbert said.
Increased flooding in Vermont is worrisome to both her and Linberg for how it could fuel the spread of the invasive.

That’s because when floodwaters pass over riverbanks with a population of Japanese knotweed, they can carry rhizomes — the part of the plant that grows new roots and shoots — downstream, where the invasives can replant themselves into the soil and spread the network further. 
The field where Herbert is working is public land that could turn entirely into knotweed if left unmanaged. 
“The goal is to work where people used to go and can’t anymore because of the knotweed and reclaim” those spots, Herbert said. 
The goats will be spending all summer eating knotweed around the field. They are moved every two or three days from one spot to another and cycle to previously grazed spots around every four weeks. On that recent afternoon, goats followed Herbert around as she kicked knotweed down to make it easier for them to reach.
“I’m happy because the goats absolutely love the knotweed,” Herbert said.

She sees animal husbandry as the most important part of her job. She trims the goats’ hooves, makes sure they get enough nutrition in their diet and sets up electric fences every time they are moved to keep them from wandering away or encountering coyotes.
Each year the knotweed is getting weaker in places the volunteers are working, Lindberg said. In some roadside spots, where the weed can’t spread as easily as by water, volunteers have eradicated the plant, he said.
Interns and volunteers are set to fight the knotweed into September. In October, volunteers will plant native plants. 
“The goal is to restore healthy, native habitat,” Lindberg said.

(Photo: Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Speeding-related traffic fatalities have increased in Louisiana, and younger male drivers have accounted for most of the deaths, according to a new federal traffic study.
The Louisiana Highway Safety Commission announced Monday the latest findings of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration’s report on speeding-involved wrecks for 2023. It determined the state is now above the national average for its rate of fatal crashes involving speeding. The study comes out annually and compiles each state’s vehicle accident statistics from two years prior, the latest data available. 
The NHTSA study found speeding was involved in 30% of all motor vehicle fatalities in Louisiana in 2023, a seven percentage point jump from the prior year’s rate. Louisiana’s rate was 29% in 2021, 23% in 2020 and 13% in 2019.
The latest increase pushed the state slightly above the national average of 29%, which has held since 2020. 
“We have a message for speeding drivers: Chill out and slow down!” Louisiana Highway Safety Commission Executive Director Lisa Freeman said in a news release.
Louisiana plays a ‘wait-and-see game’ after approving a slate of bills to lower insurance rates

Officials reported 240 traffic deaths in Louisiana that involved speeding. Nearly 83% of those fatalities occurred on non-interstate roads, the study found.
Young male drivers in the 15-20 age group are significantly more likely to be involved in speeding-related fatalities than other drivers. Accounting for 37% of speeding deaths, they are more than twice as likely to die in a speeding incident than females in the same age group, according to the report.
The risk of death becomes more pronounced when a motorcycle is involved. According to the NHTSA, 36% of all motorcycle riders involved in fatal crashes in 2023 were speeding, compared with 22% of all passenger automobile drivers in deadly wrecks. Motorcycle riders 21-24 years old were speeding in 54% of their fatal crashes.
Freeman also noted state and national statistics consistently show speeding drivers killed in crashes often were not wearing seat belts.
“It is a deadly combination,” Freeman said. “Just taking a few extra seconds to buckle up and driving the speed limit can make a world of difference.”

(Delilah Brumer/Colorado Newsline)FRISCO, Colo. – U.S. Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado was headed out of a fundraiser here Friday evening, on his way to a town hall with U.S. Rep. Joe Neguse, when he was asked by Newsline to respond to criticism that he has not been tough enough on the Trump administration.
“Anybody who has watched me lead the fight against (Health and Human Services Secretary) Bobby Kennedy, lead the fight against (Director of National Intelligence) Tulsi Gabbard, lead the fight against the Secretary of Defense (Pete Hegseth’s) insane use of Signal for battle plans, would know that I’ve been fighting this administration incredibly hard and will continue to fight them incredibly hard,” Bennet said.
Term-limited Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser, Bennet’s leading challenger in the 2026 Democratic primary race for Colorado governor, told Newsline before a fundraiser in Edwards on July 5 that his more than two dozen lawsuits challenging Trump make him uniquely qualified to stand up for the state as governor.
“Having been very supportive of a lot of the (Trump) nominees and having said when he announced that he thinks a winning strategy is to make nice with the Doug Burgums of the world is not going to look great in a primary where people believe this administration is lawless, reckless and harmful,” Weiser said of Bennet, referring to the secretary of the Interior Department. “(Voters are) going to look at who’s actually standing up to this administration and who’s essentially trying to make nice.”
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Bennet was first appointed to the Senate in 2009 to replace former Sen. Ken Salazar, who was chosen by the Obama administration to serve as Interior secretary. Bennet has since won reelection twice and is slated to serve in the upper chamber of Congress until early 2029. If he wins the June 2026 Democratic primary, Bennet would be a heavy favorite against a crowded Republican field.
If Bennet wins in November of 2026, he would have to resign his seat in the U.S. Senate to occupy the Colorado governor’s office, where current Democratic Gov. Jared Polis is term-limited. At that point, Bennet would then select his replacement in the Senate.
It’s the economy
Bennet on Friday pushed back on the notion that opposing President Donald Trump is the biggest key to winning in Colorado.
“I think fighting the administration is only part of what we need to do,” Bennet said. “We need to have a positive vision for what this country is going to be. And the way we’re going to get there is by building an economy that works for everybody — not just the people at the very top – but especially the next generation of Coloradans.”
Bennet says young voters turned on Democrats across the country in 2024 — at least enough to swing the election to Trump for a second term — because of the economy.
“There’s not a county in Colorado where people feel like their kids are going to be able to afford to live there,” Bennet said. “That’s where the seeds of Trumpism are sown, is in an economy where people feel like no matter how hard they work they don’t have economic opportunities.”
Weiser, who announced his campaign for governor right out of the gate in January, argues Bennet is needed more in the Senate and that he should serve out the term he was elected to because his seniority there makes him an invaluable asset for Colorado in Washington.
“I know our state government inside and out, from every agency to every issue,” Weiser said. “I can hit the ground running. Michael Bennet will have a huge learning curve if he’s to do this job.”
Bennet counters that he brings considerable experience in the private sector, where he was managing director of Anschutz Investment Company; experience in the public sector, as the superintendent of Denver Public Schools and three terms in the Senate; and relationships with leaders in and out of government all over the state — all of which will help him “make big changes” in housing, health care and education in Colorado.
As for picking his replacement in the Senate, Bennet did not name names, although he had high praise for House Assistant Minority Leader Neguse, who stopped into Bennet’s fundraiser before heading off to his nearby town hall.
‘They’re going to be bullies‘
Asked about the suggestion that he clear the primary field in exchange for a nomination to the U.S. Senate, Weiser said that does not interest him.
“I don’t want to be in the Senate,” Weiser said. “I’ve said publicly that if that situation arises, I’m not the right person. They’re better people for the job. Pick one of them. Don’t pick me.”
Weiser is adamant, nearly a year from the primary, about the right order of things in the state of Colorado: “Michael Bennet staying in the Senate, me serving as our next governor. That’s the best move for Colorado. I don’t think Michael Bennet’s the right person to be governor. That’s why I’m in this race.”
Bennet is not taking Weiser lightly in the primary contest.
“I’m today more than 30 points ahead in the primary, but I’m fighting like I’m 30 points behind, which is what I always do,” Bennet said. 
Referring to an internal Bennet campaign poll released last month and showing the senator with a more than 30-point lead over the attorney general as “a static, one-point-in-time, year-before-an-election” snapshot, Weiser said, “What it’s not capturing is the building energy and momentum that is going to drive our campaign.”
The Bennet campaign on Monday reported raising more than $1.7 million in the second quarter, setting an off-year record in Colorado and ending the quarter with more than $1.3 million in cash on hand. The Weiser campaign on July 2 reported raising more than $1 million in the second quarter, which it ended with nearly $2.5 million cash on hand.
For now, Weiser not only wants to see Bennet stay in the Senate, he also wants all of the Democrats in the upper chamber, including Colorado’s junior U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper, to fight harder against the “lawless” Trump administration.
“I would definitely urge senators to be more combative and not try to be accommodating with this administration,” Weiser said. “Accommodation is not a strategy that’s going to work. This administration has shown time and again, they’re going to be lawless. They’re going to be bullies. We’ve got to stand strong and fight back, and senators have to find all the best ways to do that.”
Bennet says he’s up for that fight but can more effectively wage it in Denver.
“I am extremely well-situated to be able to provide the leadership that Colorado needs right now at a moment when we are painting against a canvas that is what Donald Trump represents and the future that he represents,” Bennet said. “In Colorado, we can not only make sure that this place is a place that every one of our kids can call home and can thrive in and build their own lives here, but we can set an example for the rest of the country.

TOPEKA — Mickel Cherry interrupted his confession to smothering and sexually assaulting a child to ask a Topeka police detective to execute him.
Video of that October 2023 interrogation and a series of letters written by the defendant while in custody at the Shawnee County Jail were presented Monday by the district attorney to build the foundation of a case for sentencing Cherry to consecutive 25-year-to-life terms for the murder of 5-year-old Zoey Felix.
“Shoot me in my head,” Cherry urged Detective Cory Deedrick, hours after law enforcement descended on the Topeka crime scene and began undermining Cherry’s false allegation that a Hispanic man in black clothing attacked the girl.
“I never wanted to hurt her,” said Cherry, who tapped his forehead on a desk. “I wasn’t myself when it happened. I just want to f***ing die.”
In the jailhouse letters placed into evidence, Cherry asserted his mind was slipping deeper into a dark void. He sought family forgiveness for his actions. In hard-to-read script, he said he was preparing for his own death. He wrote that he was haunted by the voice of a child who had started referring to her part-time babysitter as an “uncle.”
“I still hear her voice calling me, ‘Why uncle?’ ” one of Cherry’s letters said.
Cherry, 27, avoided capital punishment by entering guilty pleas in late 2024 to first-degree felony murder and rape of the 63-pound child with a bubbly personality.
The remaining legal battle in the prosecution of Cherry centers on what minimum length of time must elapse before he could be considered for parole from a Kansas prison. The answer could come Tuesday from District Judge Jessica Heinen on the hearing’s second day.
 
The legal battle
The judge must decide whether Cherry received concurrent or consecutive “hard 25” sentences.
District Attorney Mike Kagay’s sentencing brief said there was no rigid blueprint for determining when consecutive sentencing was appropriate, but case law suggested it was acceptable when “not arbitrary or based on an error.”
“Kansas courts defer heavily to the sentencing judge’s discretion, especially when the record reflects heinous crimes or distinct criminal conduct justifying a consecutive sentence,” he said.
Defense attorney Peter Conley said records from the Texas foster care system showed Cherry’s abusive upbringing before and while placed in the Texas foster care system should be taken into account and allow for the sentences on the murder and rape charges to run at the same time.
Conley said the Kansas Department for Children and Families investigated Zoey’s welfare seven times but didn’t do what was necessary to place the girl in protective custody.
“The failures of these systems increased her vulnerability,” Conley said.
He said he attempted to subpoena a DCF records custodian to testify on Monday, but nobody from the state agency responded.
In a separate matter, the district attorney’s office denounced a presentencing brief filed by Conley that concluded Kagay’s office had directed DCF not to proceed with a child-in-need-of-care investigation into Zoey’s well-being.
Attorney Keith Henderson, on behalf of the district attorney, said Conley’s statement was “factually and legally inaccurate” and fell “far below the standard of candor and integrity expected of an officer of the court.”
“Defense counsels’ statements in that portion of their brief are dangerous and disingenuous,” wrote Henderson, who sought a correction. “They are unworthy of a member of the bar.”
In court, Conley said the statement in the defense brief needed to be clarified to say either the district attorney or law enforcement officers in Topeka were complicit in the decision not to proceed with a process that could have saved Zoey from harm.
 
Focusing on Zoey
Aimee Slusser, who described herself as a mentor to Zoey, said during a victim impact statement that she didn’t want squabbling about Cherry’s mental health challenges to be the focus of sentencing.
“I want everyone to remember who she was,” Slusser told the court. “This is about a little girl’s life.”
During the hearing, several people in the gallery wept while law enforcement officers and medical personnel presented evidence drawn from telephone records, interviews with witnesses and forensic examinations.
Cherry wore yellow jail coveralls and was shackled with chains that remained on despite the presence of six law enforcement officers in the courtroom. He periodically slumped forward to peer at the floor and tilted his head back to stare at ceiling lights. There were times when Cherry nodded his head as if agreeing with the prosecution.
Law enforcement narrated a triangulated set of surveillance videos taken from the perspective of a grocery store, fuel station and restaurant.
Witnesses filled in blanks of a five-hour period that began when Zoey’s father, Ezequiel Felix, entrusted her to Cherry’s care. One segment of the video captured Zoey and Cherry walking side-by-side. It ended with Cherry carrying the girl’s lifeless body, apparently from the two-tent homeless camp, to the gas station where the girl’s father worked.
Next to gasoline pumps, a good Samaritan and later a Topeka emergency crew responding to a 911 call attempted CPR. She was pronounced dead at Stormont Vail Health.
Cherry was questioned by Topeka officers at the scene, where a police body camera first recorded Cherry blaming a Hispanic man for harming the girl while she slept in a blue car. He claimed to have ran the man off. He asserted that he found Zoey not breathing inside the vehicle.
Cherry, who wasn’t wearing a shirt, was asked about a spot of blood that appeared on his stomach.
“I honestly don’t know,” he said. “I have a condition that sometimes I bleed from the belly button.”
He later admitted under questioning by police at the station that the story blaming an unknown assailant was a lie and his assault on Zoey occurred in a tent where homeless people had taken refuge. He said he suffocated the girl with a pillow.
“Something came over me and I did the unimaginable,” Cherry told Detective Deedrick. “Something I thought I’d never do.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Mickel-Cherry-murder-sentencing-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 20:05:30.542415

Attorney General Charity Clark joined a 24-state lawsuit against the Trump administration for allegedly “unlawfully freezing” $26 million in federal education funding for Vermont schools, and over $6 billion nationwide, according to a press release Monday.The lawsuit, which includes Vermont as a plaintiff alongside 23 other states and Washington D.C., accuses the Trump administration of illegally halting funds for six federal education funding programs previously approved by Congress.The six grants in question vary in scope and mission. They include supporting after school and summer programs, educating children of legal migrants, training teachers to work with working class students and students of color, school conditions and drug-prevention for low-income and inner-city schools, adult literacy and education and instruction for English language learners.

The lawsuit states that funding for the six programs must be made available to schools on July 1 so they are able “to staff, to supply materials for, and to prepare facilities for the imminent school year.” The lawsuit alleges the Trump administration sent a “boilerplate three-sentence e-mail,” on June 30 that halted funding, citing a review of this year’s awards to ensure the money spent on these programs is “In accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”This marks the 22nd lawsuit Clark has filed against the Trump administration. Clark has been one of several attorney generals to file visible, cross-state lawsuits in order to preserve federal funding for their respective states.“Once again, the President wishes to unconstitutionally undo appropriations made by Congress,” Clark said in the release. “The President does not have the power to freeze these funds – funds that Vermont schools are counting on.”

“If you forget your wallet, no worries. You are never going to forget your phone,” Gov. Jeff Landry said Monday in a video announcing the change that takes effect immediately.  

Launched in 2018, LA Wallet is a cellphone app that allows people to carry a digital version of their driver’s license, Medicaid insurance card, vaccination status card, vehicle registration and various state permits, including those for fishing, hunting and concealed handguns. 
The federal government will now treat the LA Wallet photo identification just like it would a hard copy of a state driver’s license for security screenings. 
“It’s important to Louisiana citizens because you always have your cell phone with you,” Bryan Adams, commissioner of the Louisiana Office of Motor Vehicles, said in an interview Monday. 
In the video, Landry thanked U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem, his political ally, for assisting with the change. 
Travelers must still have identification that satisfies federal REAL ID requirements to board an airplane, but the LA Wallet version can be used at airport security checkpoints if the driver has updated their license to meet the standards.

(Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.

The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Danielle Prokop / Source NM)Emergency managers in Ruidoso reported three flash flood impacts Monday afternoon in the Ruidoso area following a new round of warnings and evacuations in the region still reeling from deadly floods last week.
Around 2 p.m. meteorologists and local officials urged the public to seek higher ground in Ruidoso and the Mescalero Apache Reservation. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood warning for the South Fork Fire burn scar until 4 p.m., saying slow-moving thunderstorms had formed over the area.
Echoing the warning, the Village of Ruidoso Facebook page told residents that “This is a dangerous and life threatening situation. Do not attempt to travel unless you are fleeing an area subject to flooding or under an evacuation order.”
The impact of the flash floods remained unclear as of Monday afternoon.. NWS data shows emergency managers reported three separate roads were flooded or covered in debris between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m., including Cedar Creek Drive and Main Road and a third, unspecified road in the southern part of town that had to be closed due to debris.

The village also announced that gates to Gavilan Canyon were closed due to the floodwaters, and they warned the public that “rapidly rising floodwaters” were reported in the Upper Canyon and Brady Canyon areas.
In addition to Ruidoso, Mescalero officials reported flooding at the tribe’s community center, tribal store, gas company and the “empowerment complex,” a community hub for resources. The tribe ordered everyone there to evacuate immediately.
The National Weather Service’s flash flood warning expired at 4 p.m., though recent forecasts predict isolated flash flooding across most of Southern New Mexico until sunset at 8:21 p.m. on Monday.
The floods come after three people were killed and homes destroyed in the latest round of post-fire flooding to hit the area since the South Fork and Salt fires last summer.
The beleaguered village remains on high alert due to its already-saturated ground and the threat of post-fire flooding and debris flows. In addition to the three people killed, hundreds were displaced and swift water teams conducted 65 rescues.

(Photo by Anna Padilla for Source New Mexico)School districts in New Mexico are doing a much better job at maintaining their school buildings compared with 15 years ago, a state official told lawmakers on Monday.
Larry Tillotson, deputy director for operations, outreach and quality assurance at the state Public Schools Facilities Authority, said more than $3.1 billion in state funding has gone into school maintenance in the past 23 years, resulting in reduced health and safety issues and improved staff morale.
“Our facilities managers are taking better care of their investments; they’re taking better care of the educational environments across the board,” Tillotson told the interim legislative Public School Capital Outlay Oversight Task Force on Monday.
Every five years, the Public Schools Facilities Authority’s assessors inspect every school building across 91 school districts in the state, totaling more than 62 million square feet of building space.
They find problems like broken fire alarms; clogged air filters that haven’t been switched out; leaking swamp coolers; or potholes in parking lots, Tillotson said. They follow up with school districts over the following two months to encourage them to fix problems, he said.
Their findings go into a Facilities Maintenance Assessment Report, which scores the district on a scale from 0% to 100%.
School districts must achieve a 70% rating to receive funding from the Public Schools Facilities Authority, Tillotson said. That rating indicates that districts are maintaining their building systems at a level that keeps them running through their expected useful life, he said. Reaching a higher rating means those systems will last longer than expected, he said.
Tillotson’s presentation to the task force shows, at this point in the inspection process, the average rating across all school districts lies at over 76%.
In the first five-year inspection period that began in 2011, the average rating was 57%, putting the average New Mexico school district in the “poor” category, the presentation states. At that time, the majority of school districts were failing to maintain their buildings, Tillotson said.
Sen. Mimi Stewart (D-Albuquerque) told the committee on Monday she was thrilled to hear the report, and that she was shocked to see the improvement since 2011.
“I’ve been waiting for this for years,” she said. “We’ve been so bad at maintenance.”
The districts in the “marginal” and “poor” categories lack the staff needed to manage their buildings, or don’t have supervisors in their maintenance departments, Tillotson said.
In the current assessment cycle, nine districts fell into the “marginal” category, including Taos, Tularosa and Loving; and three ranked as “poor”: Questa, Hagerman and Pojoaque Valley.
“Many of our school districts are just not there yet,” Tillotson said.
In the latest round of inspections, Hobbs Municipal Schools scored the highest, at over 97%, putting it in the “outstanding” category.
“What that tells us is they’re taking extreme care of the educational environment,” Tillotson said. “Across the board, they’re doing a wonderful job.”
Other districts with ratings similar to Hobbs’ include Farmington, Clovis and Central Consolidated Schools in Shiprock, the presentation states. Tillotson said Hobbs school officials even went so far as to ask other districts how they could help them improve their scores.
The high score also means Hobbs will save money on maintaining its school buildings after it became the first school district ever to achieve “exemplary maintenance,” Tillotson said.
This unlocked a 5% reduction in how much money Hobbs must pay to match maintenance funding from the state, Tillotson said.
“Good maintenance efforts are critical to ensuring the delivery of good quality educational environments for our students and staff, and to provide those safe, functional learning and teaching environments,” Tillotson said.
Sen. Bill Soules (D-Las Cruces) told the committee that when education is generally underfunded, district-level officials have to decide whether to pay for a teacher in the classroom or a maintenance worker.
“Hiring teachers, social workers, counselors, educational assistants — all of those are part of the decision, as well as the maintenance portion of it,” he said. “We need to make sure that districts have the financial resources to do both, and not have to make those terrible decisions.”

A Superior Court judge dismissed, in part, the Pownal Center Community Church’s complaint against the town in an ongoing property rights dispute.
Through a lawsuit filed in April, representatives from the church aimed to shed light on the property rights of the historic building established in 1790 and connected land, and called for the town to renounce any outstanding ownership claims to the property.  
In the July 2 ruling, Judge David Barra asserted the church failed to demonstrate sufficient rights to the congregation’s site of worship for all but the carriage shed adjoining the property. 
The church has 30 days to amend the complaint to bring forth “factual allegations” and better explain the “‘inherent vagueness and complexities of title to land in Vermont’ that may entitle (the) Church to relief or quiet title,” according to the ruling.

In the original complaint filed April 4 by attorney Evan Chadwick, the church claimed it had rights to the property because it had continuously used the building for more than 15 years.
Chadwick further argued that the church held legal rights to the property going back to 1790, when the church was first established, as the land was set aside as a glebe, or parcel for the Church of England, in 1760. 
The town stopped using the church basement for meetings in 1991 and built a municipal office in 2021. The church has maintained the property since 1951 and held insurance on the property since 1980, according to the complaint. 
Chadwick also pointed to the church trustees’ and Pownal community’s possession of a deed to the carriage shed on the southwest corner of the property since 1905, according to the complaint. The town refused to sign a quitclaim deed for the carriage shed property in 1976, agreeing that the town “held no title interest” in that section of the property.
In the July ruling, Barra wrote that the “Church has only stated a plausible claim for the ‘carriage shed’ portion of the Property.”
Barra ruled that the assertion of the property as glebe land does not mean the church has a legal right to the entire property. The church also did not establish a legal claim under the state’s time limit for land recovery and exemption of public lands from recuperation through continuous use, Barra ruled.
Pownal town officials and Chadwick declined to comment.

(Pool photo by Manuel Rodriguez/FOX 13 News)After the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Utah’s lawsuit seeking to take over 18.5 million acres of federally-controlled land within its boundaries in January, a pending suit from environmentalists continues, now asking lower courts to prevent the state from filing a similar case in the future.
The state hasn’t filed a new lawsuit in a federal lower court as the Supreme Court suggested. And it may or may not pursue a new filing, Lance Sorenson, an attorney representing the state, said at a Monday court hearing. 
Now, without a lawsuit, 3rd District Court Judge Thaddeus May might have to decide whether Utah’s executive branch can file a similar suit in the future. But, first, the court has to consider whether to allow the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance (SUWA) to amend its original complaint against the state, now that the Supreme Court has dismissed the case.

“Maybe the burning question is, ‘when will that case get refiled?’ I can tell you, it’s under consideration, but it’s not guaranteed that it will even be filed again,” Sorenson said. “And so as we stand here today, there is no federal lawsuit, and there may never be one, which I think underscores our argument that there’s really no case here.”
But, according to SUWA, the state’s request itself is unconstitutional since the Utah Constitution establishes that state inhabitants “forever disclaim all right and title to the unappropriated public lands” within its borders.
U.S. Supreme Court will not hear Utah’s lawsuit to control 18.5 million acres of public land

“If the suit is unknown, why is it not better to wait for that suit to be filed in federal court and then have a reaction? Why does this court have to preempt that decision or that lawsuit?” the judge asked Jess Krannich, an attorney representing the environmental group.
Public statements from Utah officials “crystallized a legal position that is 180 degrees opposite what is in the Utah constitution in its plain language,” Krannich said.
“The basic claim is the Utah Constitution plain language limits authority in this space, and therefore the state actors are acting contrary to Utah law, binding Utah constitutional law, if they take the action that they took, and then they’re saying that they’re going to take again,” Krannich said. “That’s the gist of it.”
Rather than “taking an act that is completely foreclosed by the Utah Constitution,” the court could comment on the issue, and the state could take the appropriate steps to amend its constitution, Krannich said. 



Let us know what you think...


 


However, for the state, the original SUWA complaint is moot since the U.S. Supreme Court already dismissed the state’s first suit. SUWA’s request to amend its complaint would be “futile,” since it wouldn’t withstand a motion to dismiss, the state argued in court documents.
Additionally, Sorenson said, the remedies SUWA is requesting are beyond the court’s power to grant “because the court can’t craft an unconstitutional remedy.”
“If the federal courts were to find that Utah’s lawsuit has merit, they would be finding that Gov. Cox and Attorney General Brown are not precluded from bringing the lawsuit,” Sorenson said. “And such a ruling from a federal court under the Supremacy Clause would take precedence over any contrary ruling from this court.”
How much is Utah’s public lands lawsuit and PR campaign costing taxpayers? 

If, on the other hand, federal courts determine that Utah’s hypothetical future lawsuit doesn’t have merits, SUWA’s claims would be moot since there wouldn’t be any damages to begin with, Sorenson said. 
“It’s also helpful to know what Utah did request in its lawsuit, which was not to transfer title to Utah, it was to start disposing the land as it had done for hundreds of years prior under federal constitutional doctrines of equal sovereignty, so that the land gets disposed,” Sorensen said. “We don’t know how the land would get disposed of. Maybe they would sell it to SUWA, right? It’s all that’s speculative.”
That would imply opening up the old Federal Land Office or taking other actions to make dispositions available, Sorenson said.
After the hearing, Steve Bloch, legal director with SUWA, said that was a highlight of the state’s arguments, especially after Utah officials spent over $1 million on legal fees and a public relations campaign that includes billboards, print, TV and radio ads, since filing the lawsuit against the U.S. government last summer.  
“The focus of its campaign was ‘stand for our land,’ ‘keep Utah lands in Utah hands.’ And what the attorney for the state of Utah said this morning is, ‘that’s wrong. That’s actually not what they’re after here,’” Bloch said. “In their federal court filing, in the position that they’ve now stated in court here, they want to force the sale of federal lands into private hands, full stop.”

(Photo by Nicole Girten/Daily Montanan) Last week, Eric Jacobsen visited Holland Lake Lodge in Montana’s Swan Valley for the first time in two years. 
On Thursday, Jacobsen unlocked the door to the historic lodge — and several nearby cabins and auxiliary buildings — as the new owner of the lodge following a decision by Flathead National Forest officials to grant an operating permit earlier this month. 
The Flathead National Forest issued a 20-year special use authorization and approved a 2025 operating plan for the lodge in early July, allowing Jacobsen and his business partners to run the lodge “within the existing footprint and facilities,” according to the Forest Service. 
“I am looking forward to Holland Lake Lodge beginning to provide a minimal range of recreation services and opportunities for the community in 2025. The lodge has historic value for the forest, the community, and local economy, and has provided visitor access to the surrounding National Forest lands for 100 years,” Forest Supervisor Anthony Botello said in a press release earlier this month. “I am pleased to have reached this milestone with both the new owners and community to continue this opportunity into the future.”
Due to ongoing wastewater treatment system issues at the site, and the approval coming late in the summer season, Jacobsen said the lodge will operate on a minimal level this year. It will likely be open to just a few small private events like weddings or corporate retreats — with plans for a full public-facing season in 2026. 
“It’s been a rough journey for the lodge over the last several years, for me, for the community and for the Forest Service,” Jacobsen told the Daily Montanan in a phone interview while driving back to his Whitefish residence. “It feels pretty amazing to have been able to pull it off and have a permit and now be the next steward of Holland Lake Lodge for the foreseeable future.”

The road for Holland Lake Lodge to change owners has been marred by issues with the Forest Service’s permitting process, possible development plans and public outcry. 
The lodge has operated for a century on the Flathead National Forest with a special-use permit last reissued in 2017.
Christian Wohlfeil owned and operated the lodge for roughly two decades before selling it to Jacobsen. 
In 2022, a proposed expansion of the lodge came to public attention, and included details that Wohlfeil partnered with POWDR, an “adventure life” company in Utah that operates numerous ski resorts around the country. The expansion would have doubled the occupancy of the property and added several new structures, including a new lodge. 
The Forest Service ultimately rejected the expansion proposal, and Wohlfeil listed the lodge for sale in 2023 for $3.5 million, after saying the opposition against him included death threats. 
In 2024, Jacobsen, a private equity investor who splits his time between Park City, Utah, and Whitefish, announced his intention to purchase the lodge. He held several public meetings to engage the local community in his vision — seeking to lower the temperature of the public discourse. 
A recently-formed nonprofit called Stewards of the Swan, headed by Grace Siloti, co-owner of Mission Mountains Mercantile, had also announced an intention to purchase the lodge, and has maintained a strong stance that any new owners should keep the status quo in place for the historic property.  
“For generations, Holland Lake Lodge has served as a gathering place for thousands of Montanans and Americans to enjoy our great public lands. It should remain that way into the future. More than 7,000 Americans told the U.S. Forest Service that they want to keep the lodge the way it is and not expand it to a giant destination resort,” said Grace Siloti, the group’s president, in a statement. “We hope the new owners will manage the lodge consistent with the vision and values expressed by locals and Americans at large. And we’ll ensure that Americans have access to our public lands in the Swan Valley for generations to come.” 
Jacobsen secured the contract to purchase the property last year and subsequently applied for a special-use permit from the Forest Service, which was granted on July 1. 
Under the new special-use authorization granted to Jacobsen, the lodge, cabins and other buildings will offer lodging, food and bar services and non-motorized watercraft rentals. The lodge is expected to be fully operational for a minimum of 153 days during a normal year. 
In 2025, however, the Forest Service approved a limited operating plan due to the time of year and infrastructure improvements that have to be made on site. 
“The lodge hasn’t been open for a while, and when Christian closed it up for the winter, in 2023, he anticipated he would open in 2024, he didn’t so he didn’t close it down the way you would for several years,” Jacobsen said. “There’s definitely some squirrels and mice that have enjoyed having the place to themselves we need to take care of, along with shoring up the rest of the infrastructure.”
Under the terms of the operating agreement, Jacobsen needs to move some fencing and redo signage around the property. 
The wastewater treatment system must be addressed before fully opening to the public — a major remediation. 
The Montana Department of Environmental Quality found the Forest Service was in violation of state law when it was discovered the system which serves the lodge’s septic system, RV dump station and campgrounds near the lake were leaking; and unapproved repairs had been made. 
Problems with the wastewater treatment system were extensive enough to prevent the lodge from operating at all in 2024, which would have been its 100th anniversary year. 
According to the Forest Service, the agency is working with a private engineering firm to determine next steps in the remediation process with no firm timelines. 
Without a wastewater treatment system in place to handle a full suite of visitors, Jacobsen said his hopes for this first year of operation is to be able to host small, private gatherings this fall.
While a full reopening is contingent on fully functioning wastewater system, Jacobsen said the earliest he hopes to welcome guests full time would be the spring of 2026, when it’ll be a return to the “traditional business of nightly rentals and nightly restaurant and bar operations.”
“The wastewater issue just added a level of complexity where I just don’t think we can serve the public in the way we want to this year,” he said. “There is lots of work that needs to be done to get it safe and clean and happy, like it deserves to be when we open.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/IMG_5514-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 19:06:08.876659

Gerald Gleeson of Miller Canfield, representing the MEDC in the fight over documents seized by the Michigan Department of Attorney General last month, filed the appeal on Monday afternoon – one business day after Oakland County District Court Judge James Brady’s Friday, June 11 deadline.
The Department of Attorney General executed the search warrant after it claimed in court that MEDC stonewalled an ongoing investigation into Global Link International and its owner, businesswoman Fay Beydoun. No charges have been filed against Beydoun, but it is alleged that Beydoun may have misused funds from a legislative grant issued in 2022. The department of attorney general also raided Beydoun’s residence on June 18, in addition to its search warrant executed on the agency’s offices.
Court documents indicating that the appeal had been filed were provided to Michigan Advance on Monday, but the documents do not include a motion or a brief explaining the MEDC’s arguments as to why the attorney general’s office should not keep the seized documents. 
The agency in court earlier this month told Brady that it believed many of the seized documents were protected under attorney-client privilege and must be returned.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Part of Brady’s original July 10 order denying the MEDC’s motion to quash the search warrant executed on MEDC’s Lansing office was that the attorney general could begin reviewing the documents for privilege through the use of an independent taint team.
Brady gave the MEDC until 11:59 p.m. on Friday, July 11 to determine whether it would file a claim of appeal before the office could commence reviewing three boxes of documents and an MEDC laptop.
In the days leading up to the July 11 deadline, MEDC was silent on whether it would seek an appeal.
The deadline came and went, but the MEDC, through Gleeson, filed a claim of appeal on Monday afternoon. Court documents also show that the appeal was served to the attorney general’s office Monday.
In a statement, Otie McKinley, spokesperson for the MEDC, asserted that the economic development arm of Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration has been cooperating with Attorney General Dana Nessel and her team as they continue to investigate Global Link.
McKinley also noted that the grant to Global Link – with the amount, the recipient and the disbursement schedule set forth in past budget boilerplate language – was appropriated by the Michigan Legislature and not MEDC alone.
“MEDC strives to administer these pass-through grants in such a way that we can appropriately balance clear legislative intent with stewardship of tax dollars,” McKinley said. “That continues to be our guiding principle.”
On the materials seized, McKinley said the MEDC still holds that Nessel’s office took privileged materials without any allegations of wrongdoing on the part of the agency, and that the office had stated in court that the MEDC was not a suspect or under investigation in the Beydoun matter.
“This sets a dangerous precedent for attorney and client relationships with implications significantly broader than this specific case,” McKinley said. “Even as this appeal moves forward, we continue to cooperate with the Attorney General’s office on their investigation into Global Link.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8781-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 19:06:08.876659

(Photo by Jared Strong/Iowa Capital Dispatch)Two more contenders have entered the race for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District, which is expected to be an open race as U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra considers a run for governor.
Kyle Larsen, a farmer and land appraiser, announced he would run as a Republican for Iowa’s 4th Congressional District Monday. He is the latest contender in the primary to succeed Feenstra, joining Iowa House Majority Leader Matt Windschitl, who entered the race last week, and Siouxland Chamber of Commerce President Chris McGowan, who announced his campaign in late June.
Larsen said in a campaign launch video he is running on a campaign platform of “faith, family, farm” — the issues he said are most important to voters in the 4th District, the district covering much of northwest Iowa.

“I also do appraise work for farm families all over the great state of Iowa, where I have listened and learned the frustrations farm families are facing every single day,” Larsen said. “I am running for Congress to put an end to the career politicians who are corrupting our politics.”
The Republican is an Iowa State University alumnus who runs a pig and row crop business in Humboldt, where he lives with his wife and two children. He has previously served as president of the Humboldt County Farm Bureau Board.
Larsen said he would want to serve on the U.S. House Agriculture Committee and use his experience as a third-generation farmer to ensure that Iowa farmers’ interests are represented in Washington.
“You will see many candidates come through the door and say they love our farmers, but they can’t come close to understanding the stress every family goes through putting the crop in every year,” Larsen said. “These candidates will never understand how it feels at the end of a rough year or a drought and you’re scrambling to pay your bills and financially prepare for the next season.”
Feenstra had announced an “exploratory” committee for governor after Gov. Kim Reynolds said she will not seek reelection in 2026. Feenstra has represented Iowa’s 4th District since 2021, when he won against incumbent former U.S. Rep. Steve King in the longtime conservative stronghold.
While there are multiple Republicans competing for the seat — which is regularly ranked as a “safe Republican” House race by political forecasters — there was a period when no Democrats were running for the position. Democrat Ryan Melton, who ran against Feenstra in 2022 and 2024, suspended his campaign in June because of issues related to his family and career.
But last week, a new Democratic contender entered the race. Ashley WolfTornabane, a Democrat from Storm Lake, announced her campaign earlier in July. On her page on the donation site ActBlue, WolfTornabane, said if elected, she would work on issues like funding education, advocating for LGBTQ+ individuals and people from other marginalized populations and creating a “feasible pathway to citizenship for our immigrant neighbors.”
WolfTornabane, a stay-at-home mother, also said she supports raising the minimum wage and a “health care for all” system.

Kelly Armstrong presents his proposed budget for the 2025-27 biennium to lawmakers at the Capitol on Jan. 15, 2025. (Mary Steurer/North Dakota Monitor)North Dakota Gov. Kelly Armstrong expressed concerns Monday that a recent Ethics Commission advisory opinion effectively created a new law without input from the Legislature.
The advisory opinion, requested by Sen. Josh Boschee, D-Fargo, and published in June, spoke to whether it is unethical for a public official or someone running for office to use campaign money to pay for child care or security services.
The commission concluded that using campaign money for those purposes is generally permissible if the need for those services was directly caused by the individual’s candidacy or public service.
Armstrong in public testimony pushed back on these findings.
“Paying for day care or security is a policy question, it’s a political question, and it ends up being a legal interpretation of the Century Code,” he said during the hearing. “It should be subject to hearings, should be subject to debate, and it should be subject eventually, to a vote.”
Commissioner Murray Sagsveen during the meeting invited Armstrong to meet with commissioners at a later date to discuss his concerns in more detail.
The commission is permitted to issue advisory opinions under state law, and has done so since 2022.
Armstrong’s remarks about the June advisory opinion came after his public testimony on the Ethics Commission’s proposed travel disclosure rules. It’s unusual for a governor to testify in person at a public hearing for agency rules. Armstrong was one of two people to testify.
The draft rules would require public officials regulated by the Ethics Commission to report certain details to the state any time they go on a trip paid for by a third party in their capacity as a public servant. The official would have to file information about the purpose and dates of the trip, where they went, how much it cost and where the money came from.
The proposed rules also establish a set of penalties for violators, with the fees for late, incorrect or incomplete filings ranging from $25 to $200. The commission would also be able to hand down a fine for someone who fails to report travel details required by other state agencies, like the Office of Management and Budget.
In the most extreme case, the commission could assess a fee of up to $5,000 for an official found to have knowingly failed to report or to have falsified trip details. The commission would also be able to charge for the cost of investigating and collecting such a fee, the draft rules state.
Armstrong said he was generally supportive of the idea of travel disclosure rules, but asked the commission to ensure that anyone fined for violating the rules has the opportunity to appeal.
“There has to be some due process built into it,” he said.
ND Ethics Commission has no authority to punish officials violating ethics laws, state leaders argue

The draft rules were partly based on the statute that establishes late filing fees for campaign disclosures to the North Dakota Secretary of State’s Office. The proposed rules state that the commission may collect fines through its complaint process, a civil action or by sending the fine to a collection agency. Each of those avenues allow the fined individual to respond.
“The commission is open to continued discussions with the governor to ensure due process is satisfied,” Ethics Commission General Counsel Logan Carpenter said in an email.
Armstrong also had questions about how the rules would apply to a public official who traveled for work but then left their position before reporting the required details about their travel.
“People get on and off boards all the time,” Armstrong said. “Where in that process does jurisdiction begin? Where does it end?”
The Attorney General’s Office in a July 10 letter to the commission objected to the proposed rule on the basis that the commission lacks authority to enact penalties. The Attorney General’s Office previously raised this concern in public comments to lawmakers during the 2025 legislative session.
The Attorney General’s Office wrote that if the commission enacts the penalties, the commission would infringe on the powers of the Legislature and executive branch. The Attorney General’s Office also said that any agency that wants to enact a new fee must seek approval from the Legislature, Budget Section or Emergency Commission.
“The Commission would assume the roles of the legislature, investigator, prosecutor, judge, and jury in each of its cases without the separation of powers mandated by the Constitution,” the agency stated in the July letter. It also argued that the $5,000 fine in the draft rules could be “unconstitutionally excessive.”
The commission has said its ability to enforce ethics laws is implicit in the voter-initiated constitutional amendment that created it.
In the public hearing, Rep. Clayton Fegley, R-Berthold, said the system proposed by the draft rule could be burdensome to state lawmakers.
“I’m an EMT, and I get paid $50 for every time I go on an ambulance run,” he said. “Well, that’s travel — am I going to have to file every time I go on an ambulance run?”
As currently written, the proposed rules would only apply to travel that officials the Ethics Commission regulates make in their capacity as public representatives. They wouldn’t require officials to disclose trips that they take as private citizens.
As of Monday, the only other comment on the proposed rules was submitted by a private citizen over email who said the travel rules were necessary to prevent corruption by public officials. The citizen specifically referenced former Sen. Ray Holmberg of Grand Forks, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison earlier this year on child sex tourism charges. At least some of his travels abroad were subsidized with state money.
Comments on the draft rules may be submitted until July 28. To submit a comment, visit the Ethics Commission’s website.

(Screencap)Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha joined 23 states and the District of Columbia Monday in filing suit against President Donald Trump’s administration over $6.8 billion in unexpectedly frozen funds for education initiatives like summer programming and adult learning.
The lawsuit was filed Monday in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island against the U.S. Department of Education, the Office of Management and Budget and President Donald Trump. The complaint is the first legal response to a June 30 email memo sent from the U.S. Department of Education to education departments nationwide detailing the abrupt suspension of billions in federal education grants. 
A quarter of the grant money typically arrives in state education coffers on July 1, the start of a new fiscal year, so local education departments can plan for the year ahead. But the expected payments were paused on June 30, the last day of fiscal year 2025. The maneuver’s timing leaves state-level education officials in precarious positions as they plan for the year ahead, Neronha suggested during a virtual press conference Monday with the Attorneys General of California, Colorado, and Massachusetts, who co-lead the lawsuit.
“It is impossible for states to effectively budget for an upcoming school year…when the president takes the football away from us like Lucy in a Charlie Brown cartoon,” Neronha said.
The funds supported after-school and summertime programming for kids, as well as adult education, and teacher training. In states like Massachusetts, the grants also subsidized education for children of migrant workers.
Rhode Island would lose an estimated $29 million in federal funds. Across New England, Massachusetts would see a loss of over $100 million, and Connecticut would receive $50 million less. Vermont and Maine would lose $25 million each. New Hampshire, which would also see a $25 million loss of grant funding, is the only New England state not listed as a plaintiff in the suit.
R.I. leaders are planning their next move after feds withhold $30M in K-12 funding

The grants now depend on a review meant to ascertain whether “taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” according to the three-sentence email from the education department sentJune 30. 
The U.S. Department of Education did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday. A July 9 statement Office of Management and Budget  shared with Rhode Island Current noted that the funds were paused after some school districts had allegedly used previous grant money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda.”
The attorneys general argue that the funding freeze violates an assortment of federal laws and constitutional principles — both recurring themes in the arguments they made in dozens of similar multi-state lawsuits brought to court since Trump took office in January.  
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, who hosted the press conference, described the lawsuit as the latest defensive move against what he called the Trump administration’s “little regard for the law.” 
“In fact, out of the 31 lawsuits I and many of my colleagues have now filed against the Trump administration in the last 25 weeks, eight of them challenge unlawful attacks on education,” Bonta said.
The coalition of attorneys general wants a federal judge to rule that the funding freeze is illegal, as well as order the federal government to release the money. A pair of court filings seeking both outcomes comprises over 180 pages, and describe the freeze as “contrary to law, arbitrary and capricious, and unconstitutional.”  
Neronha told reporters that, in Rhode Island’s case, the funding freeze comes at an especially inopportune time, with the state’s part-time legislature having just wrapped up its legislative session three weeks prior. 
“It was a very difficult budget year,” Neronha said, with lawmakers forced to make tough fiscal decisions amid the state’s many money troubles, including an ailing health care infrastructure. 
But the AG said he hoped that the issue would be resolved “far, far, far before” legislators return for a new legislative session in January. 
Rhode Island Department of Education Commissioner Angélica Infante-Green previously denounced the funding freeze at a July 9 press conference. In a Monday statement, Infante-Green again decried the funding stoppage as one that “harms Rhode Island’s students, families, and teachers.” The $29 million loss of Congressionally approved aid means “there will be cuts” to before- and after-school programs, STEM learning, multilingual education, and professional development for teachers, Infante-Green said. 
“Rhode Island students have been making significant strides in education progress, post-pandemic,” Infante-Green wrote in her statement. “Delays and cuts in federal funds put progress and momentum in every district in Rhode Island at risk. RIDE is working closely with education leaders across the state, and across the country, doing everything we can to protect our students and limit disruptions to their learning.“ 
Taking legal action against the Trump administration is now routine for Neronha’s office. His office’s  website has tallied its salvoes against the Trump administration since March 13. Thus far, Neronha has co-led or joined 26 lawsuits against the Trump administration.
Asked by reporters about the likelihood of success in the present funding case, Neronha declined to predict an outcome.
“I don’t want to get ahead of ourselves and I don’t obviously want to speak for the court,” he said. “We have to make our points there as well. But based on the track record…we’ve seen this story before. We’ve been in the ring before with these sorts of cases and we’ve had great success because the violations of the law are so obvious.”

Mike Kehoe signs his first executive orders following his inauguration ceremony in January.(Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).Missouri Gov. Mike Kehoe signed a bill Monday that would establish a fund to pay for hyperbaric oxygen therapy for veterans with a traumatic brain injury and facing post-traumatic stress disorder to help prevent suicide and opioid addiction.
This spring, the legislation received overwhelming support from state lawmakers, passing with a 33-0 vote in the Missouri Senate and a 156-1 vote in the House.
“The bottom line is, there are too many veterans that are taking their lives,”  said state Rep. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City sponsoring the legislation, during debate. “They don’t see a way out. They can’t deal with it. And I think the oxygen therapy certainly will help and maybe even is the answer.”
State Sen. Rick Brattin, a Republican from Harrisonville, sponsored a companion bill in the Senate.
According to the Mayo Clinic, the goal of hyperbaric oxygen therapy is to get more oxygen to tissues damaged by disease, injury or other factors. Patients enter a hyperbaric oxygen therapy chamber, where the air pressure is increased up to three times higher than normal air pressure. The lungs can gather much more oxygen than would be possible breathing pure oxygen at normal air pressure.
The bill directs the Missouri Veterans Commission to compile an annual report with data about the treatment of hyperbaric oxygen therapy and its effectiveness.
Dale Lutzen, a retired senior master sergeant from the U.S. Air Force and a legislative advocate for the non-profit TreatNOW, said he’s been pushing for the last four years to get the fund established.
Lutzen told lawmakers in a committee hearing in January that veterans with traumatic brain injuries or PTSD are typically given prescription drugs that treat symptoms but don’t cure the brain injury.
“As an alternative to drugs, hyperbaric oxygen therapy stimulates brain wound healing and it can reverse soft tissue and neurocognitive damage,” Lutzen said during a hearing. “This treatment allows patients to experience recovery of cognitive and neurological functioning without surgery or drugs.”
Despite numerous studies that prove its efficacy, the treatment is not on Medicare’s approved list, he said, and is not covered. 
“At its most basic level, HB262 gives veterans, who have been diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury or PTSD, the right to receive the treatment as prescribed by a doctor,” he said.
Last year, the bill passed in the House but stalled in the Senate.
According to the bill’s fiscal analysis, the cost of reimbursing hyperbaric facilities for the necessary treatments could exceed $5 million annually. The funds will come from “any appropriations, gifts, bequests, or public or private donations,” the bill states.
State Rep. Stephanie Boykin, a Democrat from Florissant and a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, spoke in support of the bill on Monday.

Article Summary

Former Commonwealth Edison executive John Hooker has been sentenced to 18 months in prison in addition to a $500,000 fine — the first of the “ComEd Four” to face sentencing after their 2023 convictions.
A jury found Hooker and his co-defendants guilty of bribing ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan with jobs and contracts for his political allies at the electric utility while the company was pushing for legislation in Springfield.
Hooker’s co-defendants are to be sentenced later in separate hearings.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


CHICAGO — A former executive for electric utility Commonwealth Edison has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for his role in bribing ex-Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan for jobs and contracts for the Democratic power broker’s political allies.

John Hooker, a career employee at ComEd who worked his way up from the mail room to a job as the utility’s top internal lobbyist, is the first of the “ComEd Four” to face sentencing; his co-defendants are scheduled for their own hearings in the coming weeks.

In sentencing Hooker on Monday, U.S. District Judge Manish Shah zoomed out from the specific actions that led to across-the-board guilty verdicts for the ComEd Four, convicted in 2023 for orchestrating a yearslong bribery scheme targeted at Madigan to grease the wheels for major legislation the utility was pushing in Springfield.

“Corruption fuels a power that is wielded not for representative democracy by the will of the people, but things like oligarchy, autocracy, even kleptocracy, all while keeping up appearance of democracy,” Shah said. “To do business with corrupt power encourages it, and that’s what you did here.”

Sentencings for Hooker and his co-defendants were put on hold for more than two years, delayed by concerns of possible impact from a U.S. Supreme Court ruling, the death of the original judge who oversaw their case, and Madigan’s own lengthy trial.

The jury in the former speaker’s trial ended with a split verdict in February, including acquittals and deadlock on more than half of the charges — including bribery — both related to ComEd and entirely separate from the utility. But jurors returned guilty verdicts on each of the four counts involving Madigan’s own role in pushing for a handful of allies to get what were ultimately do-nothing contracts amounting to $1.3 million paid out from ComEd over eight years.

In wiretapped phone calls played both at trials for Madigan and the ComEd Four, Hooker and his co-defendant, longtime ComEd lobbyist Mike McClain, talked about having come up with the arrangement to conceal the no-work contractors within existing legitimate lobbying contracts.

In a February 2019 recording, McClain said the utility “had to hire these guys because Mike Madigan came to us,” and Hooker agreed, saying their use of ComEd lobbyist Jay Doherty as a pass-through entity was “clean for all of us.”

“We don’t have to worry about whether or not, I’m just making this up, whether or not Mike Zalewski Sr., is doing any work or not,” McClain told Hooker in the phone call, referring to the former Chicago alderman who’d been put on Doherty’s contract the previous summer. “That’s up to Jay Doherty to prove that.”

Hooker concurred.

“We came up with this plan and between him (Doherty), our friend, and Tim (Mapes) and the alderman, they thought it was great,” Hooker said, using “our friend” to mean Madigan, as established across both trials, and referring to the speaker’s former chief of staff Tim Mapes.

More than six years after the FBI recorded that call, Hooker on Monday told Shah that “listening to himself” on those wiretapped calls was “a very humbling experience.”

“I do not like the way I sound on those recordings,” Hooker said. “I’m just deeply sorry after listening to those recordings of myself. ... I pray that I’m not defined by these words and this case for the rest of the years that I have left on this earth.”

Reiterating prosecutors’ request for 56 months in prison, Assistant U.S. Attorney Julia Schwartz on Monday cited more secret recordings of Hooker, which she said “shows this defendant knew full well these payments going to subcontractors … were paid for the purpose of buying legislation.”

In one February 2019 video surreptitiously recorded by ComEd exec-turned-FBI mole Fidel Marquez, Hooker imagined how Madigan might react if the utility could no longer pay the subcontractors through intermediaries.

""‘You're not going to do something for me, I don't have to do anything for you,’"" Hooker said, speculating on the speaker’s thought process, adding that Madigan would never say it outright.

But Hooker attorney Jacqueline Jacobson emphasized that her client didn’t personally benefit from the bribery scheme and said “John believed in what he was doing” when it came to the legislation he was pushing for on behalf of ComEd.

“This is not a typical bribery case,” Jacobson said. “This is not cash in a bag. This is not benefiting someone in a way that is evil. This is for legislation.”

Before Shah handed down the 1 ½-year sentence — along with a $500,000 fine — the judge ruled Hooker lied on the witness stand when he testified in his own defense during trial. He also rebuked Hooker for his role in Illinois' long history of corruption.

“It takes courage to speak up, to say no to the face of power, like Mr. Madigan,” Shah said. “It’s easy to say yes when you have the talent and the wherewithal to play within the corrupt system. ... Lobbyists, corporate execs, public officials — whether in Springfield, Chicago or Washington, D.C. — should be reminded that there are still crimes on the books.”

Hooker sat stoically at the defense table when Shah delivered his verdict as dozens of family members and friends watched from the courtroom gallery, some reacting with silent tears. Later, Hooker exited the Dirksen Federal Courthouse flanked by his attorneys, making no comment to reporters.

He is scheduled to report to prison on Oct. 14.

Other crops across Iowa continue to progress close to the normal schedule amid another week of above-average precipitation, according to the crop progress and condition report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
Corn and soybeans both rated well for the July 7-13 reporting period, respectively at 85% and 79% good to excellent. 
Corn silking reached 36% on average across the state, and 5% of corn entered the dough stage. The central regions of the state and southeastern Iowa continue to lead the state in terms of acres reaching various development stages.

On average, more than half of soybean acres across the state are blooming, according to the report.
The second cutting of alfalfa hay is 66% complete across the state and 7% of hay acres have undergone their third cutting already. Hay rated 83% good to excellent for the week.
Oats rated 86% good to excellent and nearly all, 96%, of the crop has headed and 71% has colored.

Farmers had fewer than four days suitable for field work during the reporting period due to what State Climatologist Justin Glisan referred to as an “anomalously wet and active” weather week. 
On average, the state received 2.37 inches of precipitation during the period, which is more than an inch above the normal. Precipitation accumulation maps for the period show a band of heavy rain from river to river across the central portion of the state. These areas received 2-4 inches more than the normal for the reporting period. 
Asbury in Dubuque County clocked the most precipitation for the period with 6.77 inches. Several towns in eastern Iowa had flash flooding warnings and there were tornadoes in Canton, Clarinda and in Scott County. 
Gov. Kim Reynolds issued a disaster proclamation Monday for Scott County, due to damages from the storm. The disaster proclamation opens up state funds to help with repairs to an area and allows affected residents to apply for grants to help pay for repairs and other expenses caused by the storm.
Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Mike Naig said it was a “wild weather week” for the state. 
“Though the rainfall is improving drought conditions and helping the corn during tasseling and pollination, there are now parts of the state that could use a break from the rain,” Naig said in a statement. 
According to the report, north central Iowa has the wettest soil, with 37% of topsoil and 38% of subsoil moisture conditions rated as surplus for the period. On average, topsoil moisture conditions for the state rated 71% adequate and 23% surplus. Subsoil moisture conditions for the state were 74% adequate and 16% surplus. 
South western Iowa continued to have the driest soil conditions as 31% of topsoil and 35% of subsoil rated short.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
Elon Musk fumes tax and spending bill is a ‘disgusting abomination’; GOP senators shrug

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.


The Cook Report includes New Mexico’s 2nd Congressional District, currently represented by Democratic U.S. Rep. Gabe Vasquez as one of its Democratic toss-up races.
Political parties in New Mexico are required to adopt rules providing for the organization and government of that party, which they file with the Secretary of State. They must also file hand-printed names, signatures, addresses of registration and counties of residence of at least one-half of one percent of the total votes cast for the office of governor at the preceding general election, which at present would be 3,561 signatures. Currently, both the Green Party and Libertarian Party have minor party status in the state. The Democratic and Republican parties have major party status.


Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Nonpartisan report forecasts job losses across multiple sectors due to federal cuts in the ‘One Big Beautiful Bill.’
The post Medicaid cuts will shrink Wyoming’s economy by $140M over five years, study finds appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal Medicaid cuts in President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” could cost Wyoming nearly 200 jobs per year and shrink the state’s economy by $140 million over five years, a new economic analysis finds. 
The Wyoming Medicaid Cuts and Expansion Economic Impact was released Friday. The Natrona Collective Health Trust and several health-care-related organizations hired Regional Economic Models, Inc., to conduct the nonpartisan study. The intent was to compare the effects of the newly enacted federal cuts with the potential economic gains Wyoming could enjoy under a different scenario: Medicaid expansion. 
The Health Trust released the study on the heels of the bill’s narrow passage into law — which makes the prognostications related to cuts even more relevant.
“The impacts here start in the health care sector, but they really spread throughout the entire economy, in terms of across different industries,” said study author Dr. Peter Evangelakis, senior vice president of economics and consulting at REMI. 
Those impacts include an estimated loss of 192 jobs per year — with just over half of those in health care, followed by construction, retail and government. The state’s gross domestic product will shrink by $27.8 million per year, the report finds, and residents will have $14.6 million less annually in disposable personal income. The hardest-hit regions will be the ones home to Wyoming’s two largest towns: Casper and Cheyenne.

The study offers a look into the broader economic consequences of a policy many advocates say will have detrimental impacts on Wyoming’s health care landscape. At least 12,000 Wyoming residents are projected to lose health coverage under the law, health-care advocates say.
Evidence-based resource
Natrona Collective Health Trust commissioned the study after seeing a similar analysis performed on the state of North Carolina, Rachel Bouzis, director of policy and learning at the organization, said in an online press conference Friday.
“After that report was released in 2019, policy leaders, businesses and communities used that data to inform decisions that ultimately improved both health and local economies,” Bouzis said. 
The trust wanted a similar resource for Wyoming, she said. Along with the Wyoming Community Foundation, Wyoming Hospital Association, Banner Wyoming Medical Center and American Cancer Society, it commissioned the study — which is the first to evaluate the economic impacts of Medicaid policy in Wyoming, Bouzis said. 
For the study, consultant REMI compared the effects of cuts — which were still just a possibility at the time of analysis — with the potential economic gains Wyoming could see under Medicaid expansion. 
The two scenarios correspond with two significant pieces of national legislation. 
The Big Beautiful Bill is projected to reduce federal Medicaid spending by $793 billion over 10 years, resulting in 10.3 million fewer people enrolled nationally, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Changes include increased work requirements and potential penalties for states that have expanded Medicaid.
The Affordable Care Act of 2010, also known as Obamacare, allowed states to expand Medicaid to cover more residents. Some 41 states, including Washington, D.C., have expanded. Wyoming is among the 10 that have not. 
Where the cuts will lead to a shrinking state economy, the study found, expanding Medicaid in Wyoming would do the reverse. Expanding enrollment could lead to 440 new jobs over five years and a $60.9 million yearly increase in GDP, the study found. That includes a $41.5 million increase in disposable personal income per year, which breaks down to about $160 per family. 
“This report confirms what many experts in health care and economic policy have long understood: Medicaid is not just a health program — it has a direct economic impact on Wyoming’s communities,” Natrona Collective Health Trust CEO Beth Worthen said in a release.

The net five-year difference between Medicaid cuts and expansion is a loss of 3,160 jobs, $444 million in GDP and $260.5 million in personal income, the study finds. 
“So we do see overall, a kind of a lost opportunity, given the negative impact of cuts, and even stronger positive impacts of what an expansion could have brought,” Evangelakis said.
REMI honed in on the time window from 2026-2030 for the assessment. Medicaid cuts are set to be phased in over several years, according to news outlets.
Medicaid in Wyoming
When REMI began the study, Evangelakis said, his team attempted to base estimates of cuts on the most severe reductions that could result from what then was draft legislation. 
“We thought that our estimate would be the worst case,” he said. “It actually turned out that the cuts [in the Big Beautiful Bill] were a little bit bigger. But this should still give us a good sense of what the impacts will be.”
For the cuts, he said, the direct economic impact will be a loss in revenue for health care providers — everything from outpatient providers like dentists to rural hospitals and retail pharmacies. The largest impacts of the cuts would take place in the state’s “metro areas” that include Cheyenne and Casper.
“But there are significant impacts across the state,” Evangelakis said. 
The study bolsters arguments of health-care advocates that the federal legislation will harm Wyoming’s rural hospitals and lead to less access to health care here.

Still, the Health Trust and its other partners had no agenda in mind when they commissioned the study, Bouzis said. 
“This report is not in any way prescriptive,” she said. “We are just providing information from expert sources.” Then it’s up to the communities, policymakers and business owners to decide what to do next, she added.
Wyoming’s congressional delegation, Republican Sens. Cynthia Lummis and John Barrasso and Rep. Harriet Hageman, voted in support of the bill. 
“In Wyoming people are thrilled @potus singed [sic] the One Big Beautiful Bill into law,” Barrasso, a physician, posted Thursday on X. “It’s going to fulfill our promise to make America safe and prosperous again. America is getting back on track.”
Defending the bill during a weekend appearance on NBC News, Barrasso said Medicaid had become a magnet for waste, fraud, abuse and corruption.

(Photo by Jessica Holdman/SC Daily Gazette)GREENVILLE — Lt. Gov. Pamela Evette on Monday officially launched her bid to be South Carolina’s next governor, becoming the third candidate to jump into the crowded primary to replace her boss.
The first candidates to announce their bids last month were Attorney General Alan Wilson and Sen. Josh Kimbrell, a Spartanburg County Republican.
Filing for the June GOP primary is still eight months away.
Evette, speaking at a Greenville event space Monday night, emphasized her experience serving alongside Gov. Henry McMaster since he was first elected for a full term in 2018. Although the role is part-time, Evette has supported McMaster’s positions, including a ban on transgender athletes, which he signed in 2022, and support for the state’s law enforcement officers, she said.
“Together, we have delivered conservative successes, not excuses,” Evette told a crowd of several hundred people. “And we’ve never settled. We’ve continued to move the needle and have kept South Carolina winning and growing year after year.”

Evette also aligned herself with President Donald Trump. Like McMaster, Evette supported Trump from the get-go, she said, including when he announced his run for a second term in 2024.
“And now, with President Trump back in the White House, South Carolina needs a governor who has earned his trust,” Evette said during her half-hour speech. “A governor who doesn’t need to build a relationship. A governor who can pick up the phone and get things done for South Carolina because that relationship already exists.”
A campaign video released on social media Monday shows a montage of McMaster and Trump praising Evette, concluding with “to be continued… 2026.”
“Let’s stand up and Keep South Carolina Great!” reads her message that tops the video.
That message continued at her announcement, as people waved signs that read “Keep South Carolina Great!” and “Pamela Evette for Governor.” Several GOP legislative leaders from the Upstate attended, including House Majority Leader Davey Hiott of Pickens, and Ways and Means Chairman Bruce Bannister of Greenville.

Evette likened her business experience and unconventional path to politics to Trump’s, pointing to her own background as founder of payroll and human resources firm Quality Business Solutions.
The 2026 race to be South Carolina’s CEO is the first solo run for elected office for the trained accountant and mother of three.
Evette joined McMaster’s team as his running mate in November 2017, a year ahead of the first election in South Carolina with candidates for governor and lieutenant governor on the same ticket.
“You see, I’m not a career politician who needs time to figure things out,” Evette said. “I’m a conservative businesswoman who built a successful, national company right here in South Carolina.”
The governor has limited power in South Carolina, though the office does provide a bully pulpit to advocate for and against legislation. McMaster has gotten more of his recommendations passed, compared to his predecessors, largely because he’s worked with GOP leaders ahead of making announcements.
All of the GOP candidates so far, including Evette, have highlighted their intent to eliminate the state income tax, though that is not something the governor can do unilaterally.
In 2022, ahead of the last gubernatorial election, McMaster signed a law cutting state income taxes by more than $1 billion over an expected five years. This year’s state budget completed that phase-in period early.
Legislation passed by the House in late April calls for eventually eliminating the tax, which still makes up about 45% of state general fund revenues, at $6.5 billion. It’s unclear what the Senate will do with that proposal next year.
Evette contends the state can make up that loss in state revenue by mimicking Trump’s Department of Government Efficiency in South Carolina to cut spending. The office would also examine “useless and outdated regulations,” she said.
“For every new regulation proposed, we will get rid of 10,” Evette said.
She would continue to support Trump’s immigration enforcement efforts, she said. Although South Carolina is not a border state, more law enforcement agencies have been signing agreements with the federal government to help deport immigrants without legal documentation.
“We must continue to empower our South Carolina law enforcement to keep dangerous illegals off our streets and away from our children,” Evette said.
Evette said she would also push for universal school choice, the term for making all K-12 students eligible for private tuition aid. That would further expand on a state law signed by McMaster in May.
She also wants to continue McMaster’s push for changes in how the Legislature selects judges — as does Wilson. McMaster called a law he signed last year an improvement, but only a start. The Legislature didn’t touch that issue this year.
Evette highlighted consistency as a strong point for her candidacy. Voters “won’t wonder what you’re getting” in voting for her, Evette said.
“You won’t hope I’ll be conservative enough,” Evette said. “You won’t pray I’ll stand with President Trump. Because my record is clear.”
At least three other Republicans have suggested they could enter the race.
U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, who represents the coastal 1st District, has been hinting at a run for governor for months, taking jabs at Wilson and Evette on social media and during stops in South Carolina. She has repeatedly called Evette a “nice woman,” including in a post ahead of Evette’s announcement Monday, while adding that she doesn’t think being nice will be enough to run the state.
U.S. Rep. Ralph Norman has said he’ll make an announcement later this month. State Sen. Sean Bennett, R-Summerville, has said he’s considering entering the race but will wait to survey the field before jumping in.
On the Democratic side, Rep. Jermaine Johnson, D-Columbia, said he is considering running.
The last time a Democrat won an elected statewide office was in 2006, for state superintendent of education, and the last Democratic governor, Jim Hodges, finished his term in 2003.

Chris Brown, a Kansas City Republican, speaks in the House in February (Tim Bommel/Missouri House Communications).Local laws prohibiting landlords from discriminating against tenants who receive public assistance are unenforceable under legislation signed Monday by Gov. Mike Kehoe. 
The legislation takes aim at ordinances passed in several Missouri cities to protect tenants from discrimination based on the source of their income — especially tenants who use federal housing choice vouchers, known as Section 8 vouchers, to pay rent.
The bill was co-sponsored by state Reps. Chris Brown, a Republican from Kansas City, and Ben Keathley, a Republican from Chesterfield. In the Senate, it was carried by state Sen. Nick Schroer, a Republican from Defiance. 
Kansas City passed a source of income discrimination ban last year, though it was in large part paused by the courts in February.
Columbia, St. Louis, Webster Groves and Clayton have similar protections on the books. The laws make it illegal for landlords to discriminate based solely on the fact of renters’ lawful sources of income, including Section 8, veterans’ benefits and Social Security.
The legislation had the support of landlords groups, apartment associations, the realtors’ association and the conservative think tank Show Me Institute. Proponents characterized localities’ source-of-income protections as an overreach into property owners’ rights.
Opponents said the bill infringed on local control and would hurt affordable housing availability, exacerbating homelessness. The city of Kansas City has been opposed along with the anti-poverty nonprofit Empower Missouri and an association of public housing authorities in Missouri.

Mike Kehoe discusses the 2025 legislative session with reporters in his Capitol office on Friday (Jason Hancock/Missouri Independent).A Missouri bill closing records with personal information about young people and state court personnel includes provisions that could help governments hide records intended to be public, open government advocates said Monday.
Gov. Mike Kehoe signed the bill Monday, along with 11 other measures, as he finished work on legislation passed this year by state lawmakers. He signed all 48 statutory bills presented to him, using his veto only to reduce or eliminate individual line items in the state budget.
Lawmakers will consider whether to override the budget cuts when they meet Sept. 10 in the annual veto session.
The other bills signed Monday include legislation that would provide new support for the Missouri Sheriffs Retirement Fund, allow organizations like the Missouri Farm Bureau to offer health plans that are exempt from federal rules, and limit any attempt to tap Missouri’s water resources for export to dry states.
“Agriculture and rural communities are the backbone of Missouri,” Kehoe said in a news release after signing the bills. “By expanding health care access and protecting our water resources for future generations, these bills ensure that the families who feed, fuel, and clothe this state have the support they need to keep doing what they do best.”
The other bills remaining on his desk represent “common-sense legislation…that will positively impact Missouri families and communities,” Kehoe said.
The bill closing records containing personal information applies to material about persons age 17 or under, court personnel including circuit clerks and prosecutors, their staff and court administrative personnel.
The provision causing concern, however, is a change in how the public pays fees for open records requests, and how long those requests can remain pending, under the Sunshine Law.
Currently, government agencies can require that fees for copying records must be paid before copies are delivered. Under the bill signed by Kehoe, government agencies may require that all fees, for searching, retrieving and copying records, be paid before the request is fulfilled.
The bill would also cancel records requests when required fees are not paid within 90 days, with an allowance of 150 days for requests where fees exceed $1,000.
The change may be insignificant or it may create a new barrier to obtaining records, said David Roland, director of the Freedom Center of Missouri.
Government agencies are allowed to charge fees to search for, retrieve and copy records to fulfill requests under the Sunshine Law. The search and retrieval is supposed to be charged as an hourly rate equal to the lowest-paid personnel capable of doing the work, with copying fees limited to no more than 10 cents per paper page for physical records or the cost of electronic media for records delivered digitally.
Inflated fees are the equivalent of a denial, a Boone County judge ruled in 2019 when the University of Missouri demanded more than $82,000 for records about dogs used in research. And the fees cannot include attorney time required to separate open from closed portions, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled in 2021.
Missouri Supreme Court: State can’t charge attorney fees for Sunshine Law requests

The new language could result in inflated fee demands that must be paid before an agency even begins searching for responsive records, Roland said.
“This fee shenanigan is the latest front line in government entities that don’t want to produce records,” Roland said.
A person requesting records can ask for a detailed statement of fees and change the request to lower the cost, but it is difficult to challenge the estimate as a whole, he said.
“There is no real way for the citizen to contest the amount if the government says that is what it is going to take,” Roland said.
The legislation, as a whole, is another attempt to limit the public’s access to government records, said Echo Menges, president of the Missouri Sunshine Coalition.
She said she hadn’t seen a full analysis of the bill yet.
“I hesitate on anything that limits the Sunshine Law in any way,” she said. “The Sunshine Law ought to be gaining ground, not losing ground.”
She questions the need to limit public access to records about court personnel or juveniles.
“Are there real life situations,” Menges said, “or is this just more of what we have seen in the past, which is making up stuff that has never happened to push back on people’s right to know.”
 Sheriffs retirement

Over the past two years, Missouri lawmakers have spent $12 million of state general revenue to shore up the finances of the Missouri Sheriffs Retirement System, which provides pensions to former elected sheriffs.
The funding — $10 million last year and $2 million this year — was needed to replace money from a court fee on criminal cases found unconstitutional by the Missouri Supreme Court as a barrier to citizens to access the courts.
Missouri voters reject funding sheriff and prosecutor pensions through court fees

Lawmakers tried to reinstate the fee but voters rejected that proposal by a 61% majority in November.
The bill signed by Kehoe would increase the fee for sheriffs to serve papers in a civil case and dedicate $1.75 off the daily amount the state pays for housing prisoners convicted of felonies and sentenced to a term in a state prison. The state pays counties $24.95 a day.
Sheriffs, who are paid from $70,300 to $174,116 annually, depending on their counties, contribute 5% of their pay to the fund.
State Sen. Rusty Black, a Chillicothe Republican who handled the bill in the upper chamber, said during debate that the bill will make the system stable for at least 20 years.
 Farm Bureau health plans

After three years of trying, backers of the Missouri Farm Bureau pushed through a bill allowing it to offer health plans that don’t abide by the protections set by the Affordable Care Act. As a result, the Farm Bureau would be able to offer lower-price coverage options, which the organization and its supporters say is necessary to help uninsured farmers.
Kehoe visited the Farm Bureau headquarters in Jefferson City to sign the bill.
Opponents added provisions mandating a clear disclaimer that the coverage is not officially regulated as health insurance, mandating the company can’t cancel coverage for members because of a medical event and ensuring the state insurance department will handle complaints. 
The bill contains a wide swath of other health measures, including several added by Democrats during negotiations.
Those include: provisions mandating that Missouri Medicaid cover hearing aids and cochlear implants for adults, expanding access to testing and treatment for sexually transmitted infections, requiring insurance companies that provide birth control medication to provide extended supplies and tweaking the law around telehealth to allow audio-only visits.

 Water exports

On Monday afternoon, water in the Missouri River at Boonville was flowing at a rate of 62,600 feet per second, enough to fill an Olympic-sized swimming pool in a little over one second.
Across the country, at the Colorado-Utah border, the Colorado River was running at about 2,700 feet per second. Lake Mead and Lake Powell, the two largest water reservoirs in the United States, have both fallen this year as a scanty snowpack aggravated water woes in the West.
Under legislation Kehoe signed Monday, that Missouri River water — and every other source of water — would be off-limits to most large-scale uses outside the state. Water exports would require a permit and no large-scale water exports would be allowed outside of a region within 30 miles of the state’s borders.
Water bottled for human consumption would be exempt from the requirement.
Water-scarce states “are turning a thirsty eye to Missouri and other Midwestern states that are water rich in order to get some of that water and move it,” state Rep. Colin Wellenkamp, a Republican from St. Charles, said during House debate in May. “That is a very real threat that this bill attempts to mitigate.”

 With some children staying at Red Clover Treatment Center for a month or more, advocates fear the temporary facility intended for short-term use isn’t so short term. 
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Vermont keeps youth for weeks at a temporary locked facility that ‘just isn’t built’ for long-term stays.","Described by advocates for youth as two trailers plopped in a parking lot, the Red Clover Treatment Center is Vermont’s temporary — and only — locked juvenile facility. 
The secure program, opened in October 2024, was meant to meet an immediate need, providing a crisis-ready option for children in the juvenile justice system requiring short-term care. 
The temporary facility in Middlesex bought the state time to build a permanent, secure complex in Vergennes. But now, plans for that project are up in the air, and officials are grappling with the limitations of Red Clover given that the program may operate longer than intended. 
Vermont’s scarce options for secure placement of youth are having immediate effects. Just last week, a 14-year-old boy was held at Marble Valley Correctional Facility in Rutland — an adult jail. The boy was charged as an adult with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and was later transferred to Red Clover, according to court documents.  
Advocates for youth and Vermont Department for Children and Families officials agree that Red Clover’s operator — the for-profit contractor Sentinel Group — is making the most of an imperfect space. They agree the facility functions well when children are held there short term. 
However, that doesn’t mean juveniles are receiving ideal care, and the experiences of youth reveal the constraints of Red Clover’s stopgap nature.
The state is often holding juveniles at the Middlesex facility for a month or more. Providing an education in such a restrictive setting can pose a challenge, and without a complete kitchen, the facility often relies on takeout — including fast food —  to feed residents.  
“In our opinion, Red Clover is suitable as a short-term facility. It’s not suitable as a long-term facility,” said Marshall Pahl, Vermont’s deputy defender general. “No matter what kind of programming they put in place, even if they had great meals there, it would not be a suitable long-term facility. It just isn’t built that way.”

A temporary building for short-term stays
Since the closure of Woodside Juvenile Rehabilitation Center in 2020, Vermont has been without a permanent, secure facility for youth where residents are locked in and closely guarded. 
To fill the niche, the Department for Children and Families proposed the Green Mountain Youth Campus. The 14-bed concept, originally slated to open in 2026, would be half the size of Woodside, serving children in a space designed to be therapeutic, not punitive. 
But the state pulled back its plan to build the permanent facility in Vergennes last month, running into local opposition and zoning obstacles. Though department officials assert the state still intends to construct the facility, they have not chosen a specific site. 
In the meantime, Vermont has Red Clover. The Middlesex program, itself a repurposed psychiatric facility formerly run by the Vermont Department of Mental Health, is intended to stabilize children in crisis through short-term stays. That means holding youth charged with or found guilty of violent offenses, many of whom may also be in mental health distress. The facility is designed for ages 13 through 17, although teens up to the age of 19 can be sent there in certain circumstances, according to the state’s contract with Sentinel.

On average, the state has held teens there for 34 days, according to Aryka Radke, deputy commissioner of the department’s family services division. Eighteen children have been held in the facility at various times since it opened in the fall. 
“The facility itself lacks the size, expansion potential, and projected lifespan to meet the full needs of the state,” Radke said in an email. Otherwise, she said she’s confident in the quality of service the department has provided so far. 
According to Tyler Allen, the department’s high-end system of care director, youth held at Red Clover for extended periods of time fall into two broad categories: Vermonters whom the state cannot find a bed for at a different program and juveniles from out-of-state with court proceedings in Vermont. 
Since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, Vermont has lost about half of its youth residential treatment beds, Allen said. The decrease, driven by programs’ staffing shortages, has caused statewide capacity to slip from roughly 200 to 100, he said. 
In the web of residential placements, Red Clover is the only program required to accept any youth, space permitting, regardless of their legal record. 
Sometimes, another program might reject a youth because of their past behavior, according to Allen. And sometimes there just isn’t another place to put a child, he said, which has resulted in Red Clover’s longest stays. The department did not answer a request to provide data on the longest it has held a child at Red Clover. 
Out-of-state youth have also wound up with extended stays at Red Clover, in part due to the separate regulations governing them. The Interstate Compact on Juveniles outlines how states interact with each other when dealing with children in custody.
If a child from elsewhere is charged with an offense in Vermont — in family court or criminal court — the youth generally must remain in Vermont until their case is resolved. 
Adult criminal court proceedings for juveniles can be especially complex because they typically involve a serious offense, drawing out a youth’s time in Vermont’s custody. 
So far, four of the 18 children held at Red Clover have been housed through the interstate compact before being transferred to their home states, according to Radke. Most of those youth have been held for around 50 days, she said. 
To Vermont’s top juvenile public defender Pahl, much about Red Clover only causes concern if youth are held there for weeks and months rather than days. He praised Red Clover’s operators for making the most of the space and noted they offer youth more freedoms, such as extensive time outdoors, than other programs. 
However, the physical space poses limitations. A therapeutic program starts with designated treatment space — something Red Clover clearly lacks, Pahl said. 
“I mean, it’s literally sort of two trailers joined together in an L-shape with a courtyard between them,” he said. “They’re doing the best with what they got, but it ain’t a good space.”
Vermont’s children would benefit from more intermediate placement options in less restrictive environments, Pahl argued, and the state should focus on expanding access not just to the most secure youth treatment programs. 
Otherwise, Pahl fears youth will face the same issues they experienced at Woodside — like physical abuse, neglect and retaliation. 
“We will see those same kinds of problems again if youth wind up at Red Clover for way too long,” he said.

Takeout and fast-food
Red Clover’s licensing agreement grants the program special permission to bring in food from off site, including takeout. 
The kitchen has limitations, such as lacking ventilation for its stove, which prevents staff from cooking meat, according to the Department for Children and Families. Equipped with an oven, range and microwave, facility staff prepare cold foods and warm up precooked meals. 
The inability to prepare whole-cooked meals has worried advocates.
Patrick Warn has served for more than eight years as a guardian ad litem — a volunteer who advocates for youth in court. He’s worked with two kids placed at Red Clover. 
“Basically, their dinner is they literally run out to McDonalds or Burger King or whatever,” Warn said. 
He acknowledged that giving youth the ability to choose their meals — including fast food — can be a tool to reward or incentivize good behavior but said it should not be an everyday practice. Pahl thinks similarly. 
“Is serving kids McDonald’s at a placement a problem? Maybe it wouldn’t be if it was actually a short-term placement, if kids were only at a placement for a day or two or three,” he said. “But it’s not just a food problem. It’s a problem because that place was never meant to be a long-term placement. It wasn’t built for that. It’s still not built for that.”
Allen, the department official who oversees Red Clover, rejected the idea that the program serves takeout daily. Instead, he said the program’s staff try to find creative ways to expand dining choices for youth. That includes offering food from local restaurants, such as Thai, Chinese and more-upscale establishments, noting that fast food is one of the less frequented options.  
He acknowledged that the program serves takeout “more often than your average family.” While he did not know the exact frequency, Allen estimated Red Clover serves takeout “probably three to four nights per week,” which he described in positive terms. 
“Having some choice in meals is, I think, one of the things that we’ve appreciated about the program,” Allen said. “They’re willing to make that investment of time and energy to tailor it to kids.
Pahl and Warn also identified similar concerns with the education youth receive. 
“Courts have always held that kids are entitled to their education, whether they are in DCF custody (or) incarcerated,” Pahl said. “My understanding from our clients is that they are getting some educational services. Is it as good as we could have if we had a more permanent, better-staffed, well-structured program in place? Definitely not.”
Warn, who’s worked with kids held at placements across the state and country, said programs often struggle to provide an education when they are not attached to an actual school. To him, Red Clover is no different. 
He compared the schooling to when a substitute teaches a class — an interruption to the educational flow. 
In contrast, Allen described Red Clover’s educational tutoring as adaptable and a stabilizing factor for youth entering the program, some of whom weren’t regularly attending school beforehand.

Public versus private accountability
When Vermont closed Woodside in 2020, state officials declared it the end of an era. Since then, Department for Children and Families leaders have said the state should no longer both run and oversee a facility themselves. 
Instead, they would turn to private contractors to run secure programs in the future. That way, the state could serve as the watchdog, ensuring accountability, officials said. 
As Allen described it, the Woodside model involved a conflict of interest. 
“That inherent conflict creates a gap that can limit the power of your regulatory intervention,” he said.
But advocates for youth in the child welfare and juvenile justice systems have argued the opposite. They are skeptical that privatization will bring increased accountability. 
The state tapped the for-profit company Sentinel Group to run Red Clover and help create the still-to-come Green Mountain Youth Campus. The company’s owner operates other youth facilities around New England, including the Vermont School for Girls in Bennington and Mount Prospect Academy in New Hampshire. 
At the Bennington school, some staff have faced criminal sexual abuse charges. As recently as March, an employee was charged with repeatedly sexually assaulting a student. In New Hampshire, Mount Prospect Academy faces more than 100 lawsuits by current and former students alleging, among other claims, physical and sexual abuse, Seven Days reported 
Vermont pays Sentinel about $343,500 a month to run Red Clover, according to the state’s contract. 
Some advocates for juveniles think a tarnished reputation is inherent to any secure facility. 
Mike Maughan, who’s lived in Vermont for more than a decade, grew up in foster care and youth shelters in Pennsylvania. At age 15, he was stuck in a juvenile detention facility for a year and a half when officials could not find a therapeutic setting to treat him in, he said. 
The secure facility was not designed to heal him but rather contain him, Maughan said. Grouped together with violent kids, he suffered a traumatic brain injury when he was caught in the middle of an altercation and hit by a chair that had been thrown, he said. 
He doesn’t want the same thing to happen in Vermont. Maughan doesn’t think it’s possible for a company like Sentinel to run a facility that’s truly therapeutic, he said. 
He finds the design of Red Clover and the Green Mountain Youth Campus to be problematic — “it’s just the perfect environment for abuse of youth and staff,” he said. 
He sees the abuse as a symptom of the model. In that setting, kids are always in a vulnerable position and at the hands of a power imbalance, Maughan said. Sometimes that imbalance becomes dangerous for everyone. 
“When you go into work and you have the same youth try and punch you in the head and call you an asshole everyday for six months or so, there’s a good chance — and I’ve definitely seen it — staff will just snap,” Maughan said. 
The harm is greater when the company running the facility is not held responsible. 
“They are experts in deflecting accountability,” Maughan said. 
Warn, the legal advocate for youth, agrees. 
Rather than a privately run facility, Warn said he would prefer the state construct and run its own program, as it did with Woodside. As a guardian ad litem, he’s able to inspect any state and court records related to the youth he works with, but he cannot access records solely held by a private program like Sentinel. 
Though he’s had a positive experience with Red Clover’s staff, he views reliance on any private provider as flawed. 
“The fact that it exists is a big failure in our system,” Warn said.

With an appeals court ruling looming, federal officials indicate they won’t start rounding up horses where elimination is the end goal until Aug. 25.
The post Wild horses in Wyoming’s ‘checkerboard’ region get 6-week reprieve from whole-herd removals appeared first on WyoFile .","Federal authorities are delaying deploying helicopters and ground teams to eliminate free-roaming horses from a 2.1-million-acre region in southern Wyoming. 
After years of litigation, the Bureau of Land Management had been fast approaching a Tuesday start date for roundups aiming to permanently remove the Salt Wells Creek and Great Divide Basin herds, plus the northwestern portion of Adobe Town Herd. That’s been postponed for six weeks, however, as horse advocates attempting to halt the operations await an opinion from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver.
There’d been some confusion with BLM roundups set to commence Tuesday within the Adobe Town Herd. But those operations are being limited to areas to the south and east where some horses will be allowed to remain (between 259 and 536 horses are considered the “appropriate management level” for remaining reaches of the Adobe Town Herd). 
“We did confirm with the Justice Department, who put it in writing to us, that they would not go outside of [the] Rawlins portion of the Adobe Town [herd] before Aug. 25,” said Bill Eubanks, an attorney representing the American Wild Horse Campaign, Western Watersheds Project, Animal Welfare Institute and some individual plaintiffs. 

Over the course of 2025 and 2026, the Bureau of Land Management is planning to fully remove roaming horses from herd management areas illustrated in this map. 
Aug. 25 is the new listed start date in the BLM’s tentative horse gather schedule for the complete removal operations. Those efforts, planned to go until Oct. 23, will occur in areas occupied by the balance of the Adobe Town Herd and Salt Wells Creek Herd. Roundups to eliminate the Great Divide Basin Herd are planned for 2026, though the removal operations for all three herds could take several years and have uncertain timelines. 
BLM-Wyoming officials could not be immediately reached for an interview Monday. 
Taken together, the two horse gather operations soon to unfold in southern Wyoming’s checkerboard region are the largest nationwide in 2025. Just shy of 3,597 free-roaming horses are being targeted, according to the BLM’s schedule. 
Rounded-up horses cannot be killed because of protections afforded by the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act. Initially, animals are brought to temporary holding facilities. Some are then disposed of via adoption and sales programs. Many others, however, will live out the rest of their lives on private pastureland in places like the Centennial Valley west of Laramie.

Free-roaming horses, which experts consider non-native, can wreak havoc on native species like sage grouse when left unmanaged. An overpopulated herd inflicted devastating damage on the Wind River Indian Reservation until recently, though the rangeland bounced back after large-scale roundups in 2022 and 2023.
An icon of the West, the horses have been a part of the landscape for half a millennium. Unlike other exotic mammals, like feral pigs, they’ve amassed dedicated advocates who’ve long fought for their cause. 
The dispute over horses in southwest Wyoming’s checkerboard region — a 40-mile-wide region where public and private land meet at common corners — traces back to 2010. That year, the cattle and sheep-centric Rock Springs Grazing Association, which owns and leases about 1.1 million acres of private land in the checkerboard, revoked consent for horses to roam its property.

Both advocates for livestock and wild horses have sued over the issue, though the BLM emerged victorious in the U.S. District Court of Wyoming about a year ago and then proposed, and approved, its whole-herd removal plans. 
Horse advocates subsequently appealed. Eubanks represented horse advocates in a dispute over the same issue in 2016, when the plaintiffs prevailed in the 10th Circuit. Seven years later, he’s posing a similar argument: that the Wild and Free-Roaming Horses and Burros Act only allows entire herds to be eliminated “to provide a thriving, natural ecological balance.”
“That’s the phrase in the act,” Eubanks told WyoFile. “You can’t just say, ‘Well, some private folks don’t like it, so let’s just wipe out our federally protected wildlife.’” 
Although the litigated roundups are now set to start in about six weeks, Eubanks said it’s unknown when the opinion will come down from the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
“​​We just wait,” he said. “We hope it comes out each day so that we can understand next steps.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-14 22:01:48+00:00,CT Mirror,CT sues Trump admin. to restore $53.6M in frozen funds for education,Emilia Otte,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/14/ct-trump-administration-education-funds-lawsuit/,"The money was earmarked for the 2025-26 school year, meaning CT school districts would soon have to figure out how to adjust their budgets.","Connecticut and 25 other states filed a lawsuit Monday to force the federal government to release $6.8 billion in education funds that states say the Donald J. Trump administration has no right to withhold. 
The funding, which includes $53.6 million for Connecticut, was slated for professional development, after school programs, adult education and students learning English. The money was earmarked for the 2025-26 school year, meaning local school districts would soon have to figure out how to adjust their budgets to make up for the gap.
“Without [the funding], programs and positions may be cut, vacancies left unfilled, and vulnerable students left further behind,” the Connecticut Conference of Municipalities, an organization representing Connecticut’s 169 towns, said in a statement after the federal fund withholding was announced late last month. 
The loss is projected to affect nearly every district in Connecticut. The largest losses will be in the state’s urban centers. Hartford Public Schools are projected to lose about $3 million. Bridgeport is slated to lose $3.8 million. 
The lawsuit, filed on Monday, argues that Congress requires this money be sent to the states by a certain date, and that the executive branch cannot refuse to do so. While agencies like the Department of Education can ask Congress for the ability to revoke payments lawmakers have approved, the lawsuit argues the Trump administration hasn’t taken the necessary steps to be able to do that. 
“ This is Congress’ power, not the president’s power,” Attorney General William Tong said at a press conference Monday. “[President Trump] has hijacked, usurped, taken away, just totally unlawfully stepped in, where he does not have the authority, to take power away from Congress.” 
Normally, the federal government makes 25% of annual funding available to states on July 1. But this year, states received notice on June 30 that the administration was reviewing the funding for certain grant programs and that the money would not be released. 
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the June 30 email, as quoted in the lawsuit, read. 
The impacted grants include Title II, which pays for things like teacher recruitment, professional development and teacher training. Also included are Title III grants, which pay for programs teaching children learning to speak English, and Title IV, which funds a variety of initiatives, including mental health counseling, drug and violence prevention programs, science and math programs, college and career counseling and investments in technology. 
“ This is the big ticket stuff that we, as a state, and local school districts have depended on for decades, for 60 years,” Tong said. 
The grants were first established in a law passed in 1965, according to the lawsuit. Tong said he was not aware of any past administrations who had refused to release these grants to the states.
Connecticut House Minority Leader Vincent J. Candelora, R-North Branford, criticized the Democrats for the lawsuit in a statement, saying they’d failed to reconsider their own priorities “despite the President’s clear intent to disrupt the Biden-era status quo that failed just about every Connecticut student.” 
“Instead of holding near-daily press conferences, Democrats here would serve Connecticut better by working with federal officials in partnership to produce positive outcomes for everyone, whether it be students, educators, or taxpayers,” Candelora told the Connecticut Mirror. 
Gov. Ned Lamont sees things differently. Speaking at the press conference alongside Tong, the governor criticized the federal government’s “herky-jerky” method of distributing funds to the states, and disputed that the cuts were being done with the goal of reducing “waste, fraud and abuse.” 
“ These are afterschool programs. Programs that help us recruit teachers, programs that help our kids get back on their feet. These are the programs that are being yanked away,” Lamont said. 
Mike McKeon, an attorney for the Connecticut State Department of Education, said the loss of funds was “blowing a hole” in the budgets of local school districts, which were already finalized with the assumption that they would have this money to work with.

Kate Dias, president of the Connecticut Education Association, the state’s largest teacher’s union, said that after school programs and before school programs were at risk. “We can still open school if we don’t have before and after school programs. But what is the quality of the before and after school experience, and then how does that impact the day? That’s really important to us as educators,” she said.
Mental health counseling would also be at risk, she said, and programs focused on teaching English as a second language would probably be scaled back. 
Mary Yordon, vice president of the Connecticut chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, also noted that the funds had been supporting “established programs” for students and additional learning for teachers. 
“ Teachers across Connecticut are attending conferences and workshops to learn the new techniques, the latest brain-based science and the science of reading, and all of the other techniques that we need to keep ourselves current and to keep our practices efficient and effective,” she said. 
Justin Harmon, spokesperson for New Haven Public Schools, said the $3.1 million his district could lose was supposed  to fund teacher development, bilingual instructors for students learning English, internship coordinators, anti-bullying programs, credit recovery programs and college courses at the high school level. 
“We remain hopeful that these funds will become available,” he said.
In Hartford, the funds at risk include $2 million for adult education programs teaching citizenship and language classes, as well as $900,000 for “Student Support and Success” centers, which focus on helping students who are behind in their academic credits catch up to where they need to be. The district also stands to lose $1.1 million in professional learning and $500,000 for coaches and a coordinator for students learning English. 
Dr. Alberto Vazquez-Matos, superintendent of Middletown Public Schools, said the $861,000 his district stands to lose would make it difficult to provide similar services. “These funds are crucial to maintaining the integrity of programs that serve our diverse student population and help ensure equitable access to learning opportunities throughout our community,” he said in a statement to CT Mirror. 
Nonprofits that offer after school programs may also see their funding cut. 
Amanda Steffen, director of marketing and communications for the Boys & Girls Clubs of Hartford said the organization receives funding from one of the federal grants for after school programs. While it remains unclear whether her organization will receive the grant, she said it will continue to operate either way. 
“Safe and supportive places for kids and teens to go in the afternoon and evening are critical community resources,” the nonprofit’s vice president of development & communication, Tomeka Cole, said in a statement. “For us, every dollar matters but Boys & Girls Clubs of Hartford is fortunate to have diversified funding sources. We continue to work with local supporters and donors to ensure that we will always be able to offer our programming and services to all young people, especially those who need us the most.”
The attorney general said he was confident in the claims the states were making in their lawsuit, but said the legal battle could be challenging. 
“It’s going to get tougher as we move up in the U.S. Court of Appeals, but attorneys general are fighting tooth and nail every single day,” he said.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/EDUCATION-AGLAWSUIT-0714-Cannon-DE-210-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 18:09:52.032516

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — While pointing to mismanagement as the cause of mass layoffs and program cuts at Epic Charter School, state officials agreed Monday to hire an accounting firm to investigate further and recommend corrective action.
The Statewide Charter School Board voted unanimously to authorize its staff to hire auditors to look into financial and operational decisions that led to Epic’s recent crisis, a decision the school’s leaders say they support. The statewide board’s staff has been looking into finances at Epic, Oklahoma’s biggest virtual charter school and third-largest school district, since May and so far has found no evidence of fraud.
However, members of the board questioned why Epic administrators didn’t cut expenses sooner while the school’s main revenue source, student enrollment, dramatically decreased over the past four years.

The board’s financial compliance officer and on-staff CPA, Skyler Lusnia, said Epic administrators had overestimated revenue and underestimated expenses, putting the school at risk of insolvency. 
“I think ‘mismanagement’ is probably a really good word to have said,” Lusnia told the board. “Because while, again, we have not isolated or identified any fraud, if you look at the projections for revenue and expenditures versus actuals, it was just clear and obvious that it should have been pointed out sooner.”
The ensuing budget shortfall resulted in two rounds of mass layoffs during the 2024-25 school year that cut a total of 501 employees. Epic replaced its superintendent, Bart Banfield, and deputy superintendent of finance, Jeanise Wynn, amid the fallout.
“Epic Charter Schools supports the Oklahoma Statewide Charter School Board action today calling for an outside accounting firm to review the finances and organizational processes of Oklahoma’s largest virtual public charter school,” interim Superintendent Justin Hunt said in a statement. “Epic has been and remains committed to working closely with SCSB to ensure safeguards are in place to secure the long-term financial stability of the organization, so we can continue to provide the best possible educational experience and outcomes for the approximately 30,000 students and families we serve statewide.” 
Staff and program cuts helped Epic finish the 2025 fiscal year out of the red, but the school will have to rely on a $30 million line of credit to cover necessary expenses over the next few months, Lusnia said.
Epic enrolled about 30,000 students in the 2024-25 school year, about half as many as in 2020-21. Enrollment skyrocketed to 60,000 students in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic as families flocked to online learning, but it has steadily declined ever since.
In his first meeting since being re-appointed to the statewide board, William Pearson questioned why school leaders didn’t respond to the decreasing enrollment with corresponding cuts to staffing and expenses.

Pearson, who is the Senate president pro tem’s choice to replace departing board member Becky Gooch, served on the board in 2023 and 2024 when it focused solely on virtual charter schools like Epic.
“If you see your revenue stream is drying up, then you’ve got to make the necessary adjustments,” Pearson said during the meeting.
Board chairperson Brian Shellem said the audit will investigate what information which school administrators knew and when. It also should address how informed and involved Epic’s governing board was during that timeline.
At this point, he said, it seems “crystal clear” there was negligence.
“Timing is a critical point for many things in life, right?” Shellem said during the meeting. “If you’re driving down the road and it curves, if you wait 10 seconds maybe you miss the curve.”

On June 9, Nessel alongside the attorneys general for Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington and the District of Columbia filed a suit against U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, the U.S. Department of Justice, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and set of gun rights groups and manufacturers, arguing President Donald Trump’s administration aimed to distribute thousands of machine gun conversion devices into communities throughout the country. 
While the plaintiff states sought a preliminary injunction to block the return and sale of forced reset triggers – devices that dramatically increase a firearms rate of fire – the states dropped the motion on Friday following word from the federal government that it would not return the devices to owners in states where they have been banned.

Those states include Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Florida, Hawaii, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Virginia and Washington.
Matthew Varisco, assistant director for the Office of Field Operations within the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said in a June 27 court filing said that owners where these devices are illegal can request for the devices to be transferred to them in a state where they are legal to possess, have them transferred to a third party in a state where they are legal or abandon the device to the bureau.  
Additionally, Rare Breed Triggers, the nation’s largest purveyor of forced reset triggers confirmed it would not sell the devices in states where they are restricted.
“These dangerous conversion devices have no place in our communities, and I am proud that our legal efforts have ensured they are kept out of Michigan,” Nessel said in a statement. “This outcome shows that when we challenge reckless and illegal federal actions, we can protect lives.

The court-appointed receiver who has worked to help Jay Peak Resort and Burke Mountain Resort emerge from a financial scandal has been granted his request for more than $1 million to help cover his latest costs and expenses for himself and others helping him.
With a judge’s approval Monday, Michael Goldberg’s total bill for his receivership that began in April 2016 has surpassed $13 million.
Goldberg’s latest filing submitted earlier this month covered the receivership from June 1, 2024, through April 30 of this year. For that 11 month period, Goldberg said the receivership amassed $1,185,240 in costs and expenses.
“During the Reporting and Application Period,” Goldberg wrote in the 262-page filing, “the Receiver and his team of professionals made significant progress towards winding down the Receivership and maximizing the value of the estate’s remaining assets for the benefit of defrauded Jay Peak and Burke investors.”
The two resorts were put in receivership in April 2016 after federal and state regulators brought civil enforcement actions against Ariel Quiros, the owner of both resorts, and Bill Stenger, who was Jay Peak’s CEO and president.

Officials alleged in the legal actions the two men misused more than $200 million of the more than $350 million raised from foreign investors through the federal EB-5 visa program. The program allows foreign investors to obtain green cards, or permanent U.S. residency, in exchange for financial investments in qualified development projects.   
Quiros and Stenger were later indicted in May 2019 on criminal charges connected to a separate EB-5-financed planned project they headed in the Northeast Kingdom to build a $110 million biomedical research facility, which regulators later called “nearly a complete fraud.”
The two men eventually reached plea deals with prosecutors, sending both of them to prison. Stenger has since been released, and Quiros remains in custody in a federal facility in Florida. 
Goldberg, in his filing this month, wrote that a great deal of his work focused on the sale of Burke Mountain Resort earlier this year for $11.5 million to Bear Den Partners LLC, a group of people with longtime ties to the ski area. 
The sale of Burke Mountain Resort followed the sale of Jay Peak Resort in 2022 to Pacific Group Resorts Inc., based in Park City, Utah, for $76 million.
Goldberg wrote in his filing that the resort was still working to sell “one off” properties in Vermont that are part of the receivership, which he “hopes to accomplish in the next six months.” Those remaining properties, including undeveloped land, were turned over to the receivership as part of a $84 million settlement Quiros reached with regulators to resolve civil enforcement actions against him.   
Federal Judge Darrin P. Gayles, who has presided in U.S. District Court in Miami over the receivership since it began in April 2016, approved Goldberg’s request Monday. The case was brought in federal court in Florida because that was where Quiros was living at the time the civil enforcement actions were brought against him.
As a result of Gayles’ approval of Goldberg’s latest fee request, the receivership’s legal and financial costs and expenses totals a little more than $13.5 million since it was established in 2016.
Money to pay those bills has come from revenue generated from the sale of the properties as well as financial settlements reached with several entities over the years for their roles in the financial scandal.
Goldberg could not be reached Monday for comment.

(Jordan Hansen / Daily Montanan)On a sunny, clear Friday afternoon in Helena, more than 50 people turned out for a Pride Shabbat celebration on the grass grounds of Temple Emanu-El.
The Montana Jewish Project hosted the Pride Shabbat celebration, aimed at bringing the community together. It was a festive, joyful event with serious undertones. On Friday, discussion at the Pride Shabbat dove into the connections between Montana’s LGBTQ and Jewish communities and the issues they face.
Greg Holzman, a Montana Jewish Project board member, said it was easy to “get lost” in what’s happening nationally and the world, calling it “overwhelming and very challenging.” Holzman also connected anti-Semitism, Islamophobia and discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. 
Anger and discrimination aimed at those two communities often comes from the same place, he said.
“It all kind of comes from and plays in the same playground,” Holzman said.
He added that events like the Pride Shabbat are a way to bring a little control back and bring people together. 
Temple Emanu-El has become a gathering place for members of the Jewish faith and the building is steeped deep in Helena and state history. It’s now a museum and a place to talk about current topics.
“LGBTQ community members have been part of the MJP story from the very beginning, not just supporting it, but helping shape what we’ve become,” said Rebecca Stanfel, a member of the organization. “This event is one way to honor that legacy.”
According to a 2023 poll conducted by the Public Religion Research Institute, 80% of Jewish people support same-sex marriage. The only two groups higher were Buddhists (82%) and Americans who are religiously unaffiliated (86%).
A Helena Police Officer was on duty watching and protecting the event and several attendees spoke about threats members of the Jewish community has received, a longstanding issue in Montana.
Erin Vang, a member of the Montana Jewish Project, spoke about the localization of some of the major issues impacting minority communities. She pointed to the Stonewall Riots as a point where people said they “had enough.”
“We’re in a phase of extreme backlash by a hateful white nationalist culture of toxic masculinity that is frightened about losing control, that is threatened by the progress we’ve made,” Vang said. “This is a time that calls us to action, and the action starts at home and right here with those gathered today. I think our Jewish history has some lessons for us about what we face.”
Vang also spoke about the recent detention of Christopher Martinez in Helena by ICE.
“Our larger community had to rally this week to call on our officials to resist the unlawful detention of one of our neighbors whose only crime appears to have been expired plates, but we have every reason to think that his real crime was having brown skin and he wasn’t even arrested,” Vang said. “He was kidnapped by an illegitimate agency, working in secret, wearing masks without any of the norms of due process that true justice requires.”
She added the patterns were “far too familiar to us as Jews.” 
Vang called on people with privilege to speak out and protect their communities.
“If you have enough privilege in your life to choose to be visible,” Vang said. “You also have enough power to make a difference by being visible.”",https://dailymontanan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/PrideShabbat-1024x674.jpg,,,2025-07-14 18:09:52.032516

Free.,US Supreme Court allows Trump to carry out plan to dismantle Education Department for now,Shauneen Miranda,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/us-supreme-court-allows-trump-carry-out-plan-dismantle-education-department-now,,"WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed the Trump administration, for now, to proceed with mass layoffs and a plan to dramatically downsize the Education Department ordered earlier this year.The decision from the nation’s highest court marks a major victory for President Donald Trump, who has sought to overhaul the federal role in education.The order was unsigned, while Justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson dissented, indicating a 6-3 decision.The dissent, authored by Sotomayor, was scathing.“The majority is either willfully blind to the implications of its ruling or naive,” she wrote. “But either way the threat to our Constitution’s separation of powers is grave.”The Supreme Court’s order temporarily suspends lower court orders that: forced the agency to reinstate more than 1,300 employees gutted from a reduction in force, or RIF, effort; blocked the department from carrying out Trump’s executive order to dismantle the department; and barred the agency from transferring some services to other federal agencies.In a statement Monday, Education Secretary Linda McMahon celebrated the decision, saying “today, the Supreme Court again confirmed the obvious: the President of the United States, as the head of the Executive Branch, has the ultimate authority to make decisions about staffing levels, administrative organization, and day-to-day operations of federal agencies.”“While today’s ruling is a significant win for students and families, it is a shame that the highest court in the land had to step in to allow President Trump to advance the reforms Americans elected him to deliver using the authorities granted to him by the U.S. Constitution,” she said.“The U.S. Department of Education will now deliver on its mandate to restore excellence in American education. We will carry out the reduction in force to promote efficiency and accountability and to ensure resources are directed where they matter most — to students, parents, and teachers.”A coalition of teachers, unions and school districts that sued over Trump’s order to eliminate the department and the mass layoffs said they were “incredibly disappointed by the Supreme Court’s decision to allow the Trump-Vance administration to proceed with its harmful efforts to dismantle the Department of Education while our case moves forward.”“This unlawful plan will immediately and irreparably harm students, educators and communities across our nation. Children will be among those hurt the most by this decision. We will never stop fighting on behalf of all students and public schools and the protections, services, and resources they need to thrive,” they added.Challenge from Democratic state AGs, unionsThe labor and advocacy coalition and a slew of Democratic attorneys general each sued in March over some of the administration’s most consequential education initiatives.One of the lawsuits comes from a coalition of Democratic attorneys general in Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington state and Wisconsin.The other lawsuit was brought by the American Federation of Teachers, its Massachusetts chapter, AFSCME Council 93, the American Association of University Professors, the Service Employees International Union and two school districts in Massachusetts.A Massachusetts federal judge consolidated the lawsuits and granted the states’ and groups’ preliminary injunction in May.The administration appealed that decision, leading to a June decision from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 1st Circuit keeping in place the district court’s order.The Trump administration then asked the Supreme Court to intervene.",,,,2025-07-14 18:09:52.032516

Lawyer Alex Rate, with the ACLU of Montana, also represents plaintiffs. (Keila Szpaller/The Daily Montanan)The Montana Legislature didn’t just pass an unconstitutional law when it supported House Bill 458, a 2023 law which narrowly defined “male” and “female.” It also left taxpayers with a hefty legal tab, according to a ruling from a Missoula County District Court judge.
Judge Shane A. Vanatta of Missoula County, ruled on Monday the State of Montana owes attorneys, including those who work for the American Civil Liberties Union of Montana, nearly $100,000 in the case for having to fight to vindicate — or keep — Montanans’ constitutional rights. Vanatta found that the Legislature’s definition of two and only two biological sexes violated the state’s constitution, while potentially ignoring the science about gender, identity, and biology.
While the law was declared void more than a year ago, lawyer in the case have been at odds about the attorneys’ fees charged by ACLU lawyers and lawyers with a Mountain West law firm, Holland and Hart, which has offices in Billings. The ACLU had asked for nearly $100,000 in fees — or $95,49.63 to be exact — while the state balked at the amount, saying the fees should be between $35,000 and $40,000, according to the state’s expert witness.
Vanatta said that while both sides offered expert testimony from other lawyers, Missoula attorney Charles Hansberry, who had previously worked for Holland and Hart, as well as founding his own law firm, had made the more persuasive arguments and detailed review of the work.
One of the issues in the case was how many attorneys the ACLU had while litigating the case.
“Although there were four attorneys working on the case, (Hansberry) did not see duplication of effort reflected in the billing entries and noted that the state had assigned more than four attorneys to the defense of the case,” the court order said.
The judge also agreed with the ACLU and Hansberry the case needed experienced attorneys in constitutional law, something that is more uncommon for Montana courts and comes with a higher rate because of the specialty within the legal arena.
“Hansberry opined that the litigation was very important in defending the constitutional rights of a minority class in our society that is under significant attack for their gender identity,” the judge said. “He believes that there is a trend of passing unconstitutional legislation by the Montana Legislature to target this minority group; he believed the recovery of attorney fees was appropriate as a price for passing unconstitutional legislation.”
Patrick Risken, an attorney who formerly worked for the Attorney General’s Office, provided testimony for the state, but Vanatta said that Risken’s work was not as “complete” or “detailed,” and even he had acknowledged attorneys used in higher profile constitutional cases in the state often made more than $500 per hour.
“Mr. Risken did not review any time entries for the State of Montana attorneys because they don’t keep track of time expended on cases,” the court order said. “He has no idea how much time was spent by state attorneys on the subject case. He does not believe it is important to know what time was spent by the state given he does not expect an opponent to match time hour for hour.”
Attorneys for the state also argued that plaintiffs, as represented by the ACLU, should be entitled to fewer attorneys fees because originally some of the lawyers had agreed to participate in the case pro bono. The state also argued that paying for the plaintiffs’ attorneys would be essentially compelling speech by the taxpayer — meaning they were forced into agreeing with the courts.
However, Vanatta dismissed both of those arguments in his order.
“First, any award is payable to the attorneys who provided the legal services; what those attorneys do with the money upon receipt is immaterial,” Vanatta said.
State attorneys had argued that Holland and Hart had planned to donate any funds to the ACLU, therefore the state should not be required to pay them since it would result in a larger amount for the organization.
“Second, the taxpayers of the State of Montana are not being completed to say (or not say) anything; rather, they are required to pay fees to the prevailing party’s attorneys who provided legal services. No endorsement of specific speech is required or compelled,” Vanatta said.

(Photo by Jim Argo/Courtesy of the Oklahoma Historical Society)OKLAHOMA CITY – Restaurants at five Oklahoma parks are set to reopen Tuesday after the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation recently suspended operations in the midst of a contract dispute.
The agency and vendor, the Lookout Kitchen, on Monday reached a conditional agreement to reopen the restaurants at Beavers Bend, Lake Murray, Robbers Cave, Roman Nose and Quartz Mountain state parks, the agency said in a press release. 
Operations were suspended July 8.
The vendor has agreed to pay past due monthly payments totaling $274,585.88.
The first payment totaling $65,000 was submitted Monday, according to the agency. Five more payments are scheduled between July 28 and Nov. 15.
“This agreement to reopen Lookout restaurants inside our state parks is a positive development for our park guests as we work to minimize disruptions to park operations,” said Sterling Zearley, Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation executive director. “The agreed upon payment plan gives Lookout a pathway to compliance, while also providing a valuable amenity to state park visitors.”
Brian Buswell, an attorney for Lookout Kitchen, said he had no comment Monday.

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Twenty-eight cities and counties including Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights, and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties, and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”
The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

Jeff Landry announced Monday he will name the state’s largest National Guard training site after a little-known early 19th century Louisiana militia member and slaveowner, the father of the Confederate general whose name the facility originally carried. 
The Louisiana National Guard Training Facility in Pineville will once again be known as Camp Beauregard, which had been its name until 2023 when the state joined a nationwide effort to remove monuments and honorifics to Confederate veterans and leaders. 
The site was previously named after Gen. Pierre Gustave Toutant Beauregard, who initiated the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter, South Carolina, to begin the Civil War. It will now be named after Capt. Jacques Toutant Beauregard, a member of the Louisiana Militia who reportedly fought in the 1815 Battle of New Orleans. Jacques Toutant Beauregard is P.G.T. Beauregard’s father, Louisiana National Guard spokeswoman Lt. Col. Noel Collins confirmed to the Illuminator. 
Landry announced the renaming of the facility with a social media post that included a seemingly AI-generated image of a headstone that reads “Wokeism.” 
“By restoring the name Camp Beauregard, we honor a legacy of courage and service that dates back over two centuries,” Landry said in a news release. “Let this also be a lesson that we should always give reverence to history and not be quick to so easily condemn or erase the dead, lest we and our times be judged arbitrary by future generations.”
The governor’s news release does not mention the Beauregards are related to each other. 
P.G.T. Beauregard, a native of St. Bernard Parish, was the first Confederate to receive the rank of general after Louisiana seceded from the United States. He would later take advantage of the mass pardons for treason offered to former Confederate officers and officials by President Andrew Johnson. The former general was reportedly reluctant to swear an oath of allegiance to the United States but was persuaded to do so by Johnson and Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. 
After his return to Louisiana, P.G.T. Beauregard became a railroad superintendent and argued for Black voting rights in order to remove the radical Republicans who had gained control of state and local government during the Reconstruction period. 
According to a Louisiana National Guard news release, Jacques Toutant Beauregard was a member of the Louisiana Militia whose regiment took part in a fight that was a prelude to the Battle of New Orleans.
Jacques Toutant Beauregard was the owner of a sugarcane farm in St. Bernard Parish later named the Contreras Plantation, where P.G.T. Beauregard was born. The Beauregard family owned slaves on the plantation, according to T. Harry Williams’ biography “P.G.T. Beauregard, Napoleon in Gray.” 
In the news release, Maj. Gen. Thomas Friloux, adjutant general of the Louisiana National Guard, praised Jacques Toutant Beauregard as an American hero.
“We’re naming our premier training installation after an American hero and patriot who fought for the freedom of the city of New Orleans, the State of Louisiana, and the United States of America against a foreign invader,” Friloux said.

(Photo courtesy of Rev. Minna Bothwell)As Iowa Christian faith leaders are preparing for the impact President Trump’s “one big, beautiful bill act” will have on their parishioners, many of them are voicing their opinions to the communities they serve. 
The expansive bill includes cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, health care services, additional work requirements and new immigration policies. 
“With the ‘big, beautiful bill,’ I keep thinking to myself, we have so many generous people in the neighborhood and we have so many generous organizations but can those institutions and those people continue to be as generous once this bill goes through?” said Rev. Lizzie Gillman, priest at St. Andrews Episcopal Church in Des Moines. 
What faith communities are hearing from their leaders
“The Gospel in itself is political in the sense that laws and policies affect people and people are made in the image of God,” Rev. Minna Bothwell, pastor of Capital Hill Lutheran Church in Des Moines said. “We are called as a church to tend and care for God’s people.”
The social justice committee at Capitol Hill Lutheran Church made a post urging parishioners to contact Congressman Zach Nunn and “let them know this budget does not reflect your values or your faith.” Bothwell said she “stays true to the text,” of the Gospel and whenever Jesus addresses “something difficult in the community,” she will talk about it on Sunday.

The church’s social justice committee meets weekly to discuss the church’s missions “to address the concerns of the community and the impact bills and laws have on real people that we serve every single day.”
Pastor Joseph Hall of Crossroads Church in Council Bluffs also openly discusses his political beliefs with parishioners. 
“If we can’t talk about it in church, where are they going to hear it? You know, from the lame-stream media? From liberals? They’re not quiet about their beliefs and their stance and so I’m the same,” Hall said. “I can’t sit silent because somebody’s going to teach my people, one way or the other. They better hear it from me, from a biblical, faith standpoint.”
Recently in a court filing, the Internal Revenue Service stated churches could openly campaign and endorse candidates. Hall responded to this news in a Facebook post, stating “This pastor endorsed without their permission. But thank you anyway. Maybe now more pastors won’t sit silently while their nation is at stake?!” 
He said he has been named “America’s most patriotic pastor” by several sources, including the book “Donald Trump’s Army of God,” by Clifford Cook and Anise Cook, a book on Christian nationalists in Iowa. However, Hall says he wears the title “proudly,” and claims the reporters tried to “give us a bad name.”
When Trump was running his campaign in Iowa, Hall served as a caucus captain and “hosted multiple events for the Trump team.” He has also opened multiple Trump rallies including the recent America250 kickoff at the Iowa State Fairgrounds.
Hall claims the separation of church and state has always been taught wrong: “It was never to take the church out of the state, it wasn’t to take people of faith out of the government, it was to not allow the government to control the church,” and that “godly, biblical values should direct every policy in office.” 
The Rt. Rev. Betsy Monnet, 10th bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Iowa, however, says that within the Episcopal church “all of our sermons ought to be based on the Gospel.” She said the church is “attempting to preach the Gospel” and “the values that are behind it” but parishioners may not hear their priests referring specifically to pieces of legislation or “individual political positions.”
“Somebody who goes to an Episcopal church will probably hear prayers for the hungry, for the poor. Prayers for immigrants and prayers for those who are in danger. Prayers for those who are seeking healthcare and so on. Prayers for our creation, that we might be good stewards of it,” Monnet said. 
Cuts to SNAP benefits
The Congressional Budget Office states the total federal spending for SNAP will be reduced by $287 billion between 2025 and 2034. According to a study done by Feeding America, this number is roughly equivalent to between 6 billion and 9  billion meals per year.
Brother James Dowd is a Benedictine monk and founder of The Benedictine Way in Omaha. His work as a monk has taken him to congregations across Iowa and the surrounding states, including a recent visit to St. Paul’s Episcopal Cathedral in Des Moines.
At St. Paul’s, he delivered a homily urging members of the congregation to “love urgently” those impacted by the bill passing, specifically including immigrants, the trans individuals and those who will lose SNAP benefits.
According to Dowd, the Omaha neighborhood where his team hosts a food pantry has an unemployment rate of around 8%, compared to the rest of the city where it’s “virtually nonexistent.” He said between the cuts to the Local Food Purchase Assistance Cooperative Agreement and the cuts to SNAP benefits, his St. Benedict’s Food Pantry will see two things: “the folks who are already coming will need more help and new people are going to be coming on top of it.” 
His team’s pantry operates two days a week, Saturday morning and Tuesday afternoons. The Saturday morning slots are mostly attended by elderly individuals, he said.
“The decision they’re making is ‘Do I pay for medicine, do I pay for food?’ And that can literally be a life-threatening decision,” Dowd said. 
On Tuesday afternoons, Dowd sees mostly mothers with young children who “just can’t make ends meet.” He said watching them coming home from work and picking their kids up but struggling to feed their kids is “the most heartbreaking.”

However, Hall sees “things a little differently.”
“We try to bridge the gap and meet the need but then, not just give stuff away,” Hall said. “That’s not why we’re called, we’re called to lead them to a better life, to making better decisions, being better people, better citizens, better Christians.”
Crossroads Church in Council Bluffs doesn’t have any on-site outreach ministries but instead organizes a food and clothes drive for the local New Visions Homeless Services and hosts fundraising efforts “several times a year.” 
Hall is a U.S. Army veteran and has served as lead pastor of Crossroads Church for just shy of 13 years. 
“When hard-working, law-abiding, American-loving patriots take more money, that’s a good thing. A big, beautiful thing. This is the greatest tax break in U.S. history,” he said. 
Hall added, “the big, beautiful bill is a big, beautiful win” for the faith community, Christians, the church, the nation, and for citizens. He believes this budget bill will “secure our future,” for both “America and Americans.” 
Under the budget bill, beginning in 2027, taxpayers will be able to claim a credit of up to $1,700 a year to be used as qualified donations that support private K-12 school scholarships.
Hall says this “tax-credit for school choice” is a good thing for the faith community as it gives people of faith, who couldn’t afford it before, the chance to send their kids to a Christian school and “get them out of the woke public school system where liberal, evil teachers are indoctrinating our children.” 
The Iowa Department of Education already operates the Students First Education Savings Account. These accounts give taxpayer dollars totaling $7,826 per student for the 2024-2025 school year to eligible families to use on private school tuition and expenses. 
He also believes the new federal law protects religious freedoms and claims “the last administration was attacking and trying to eliminate” those freedoms.
“The impact of this bill is huge. It’s the most pro-family, pro-worker, pro-Christian, pro-American bill ever passed, that’s why it’s called ‘big and beautiful,’” said Hall. “Plain and simple, its America first. Not illegals, not other countries.”
Reactions to immigration policies 
Bothwell calls the deportation-focused provisions in the budget bill “devastating,” claiming it will “tear families apart” and “send people to communities that are unsafe.” She said for families who are seeking asylum from political violence, “there are already quite a few fees to even get an attorney to help you file for asylum and file for a permit,” which will be exacerbated by the new fees introduced. 
The new fees required by this bill include:

a $100 non-waivable fee to apply for asylum and a $100 annual fee for each year the application is pending.
A new application fee of $250 for Special Immigrant Juvenile Status.
An increased, non-waivable fee from $50 to $500 when applying for Temporary Protected status.
An increased fee of $550 for an initial work permit based on asylum applications.
A fee of $275 for each renewal or exemption of employment authorization.

“It’s putting individuals who are already vulnerable in a more vulnerable place. I see our calling as Christians to ease burdens, not to create tolls,” she said. “These punitive fees punish families who are fleeing violence and seeking safety which then compounds trauma with financial strain. Financial strain that already exists before this bill goes into practice.”
Hall, however, believes in stricter rules. 
“Stricter rules on illegals, undocumented immigrants is a good thing just as stricter rules on criminals is a good thing. No consequences on criminals leads to greater crime,” Hall said. 
This bill rewards and enforces “buying American, making American, staying in America,” he said. “The fact of the matter is, if we are true and true Americans, we should love America and we should support America. If we don’t love it, then you should find somewhere else to live.”
“I don’t think it’s prudent budgeting as much as it is a denial of dignity,” Bothwell said. “These are people, they’re not faceless statistics, they’re our neighbors, they are made in God’s image and we are called to love and support them.”
Bothwell’s parish is composed of members “born on five different continents, and are from 23 different countries.” She says many of the members in her congregation rely on SNAP programs and her parish helps them apply for food assistance. 
She referenced a study conducted by the Iowa Hunger Coalition that states over 60% of SNAP recipients report the affordability of healthy foods as a barrier to healthy diets, saying “over 60% of these recipients are working families they just don’t earn enough to cover the cost of utilities.”
“Adding work requirements doesn’t create self-sufficiency, it just kicks people off of programs who are already struggling to get by,” she said. “It’s kind of like, I don’t know, pulling a ladder away from somebody, right? And then blaming them for not climbing the ladder you’ve just pulled away.”
Work requirements
Beginning on Dec. 31, 2026, beneficiaries of Medicaid ages 19-64 will have to work 80 hours a month to be eligible for benefits. Currently, beneficiaries of SNAP programs without dependents aged 19-54 need to work for more than three months in three years.
The new work requirement will require beneficiaries ages 18-64 and those with children aged 14 years and up to work the same length of time, but it is currently unclear when these requirements will go into effect. 
Hall believes “restrictions are a good thing” because unrestricted access to food can “more times than not, enable their situation and enable their mindset.” He said setting rules ensures people won’t “take advantage of the system.” 
He quotes 2 Thessalonians 3:10 “For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: ‘The one who is unwilling to work shall not eat,’” to give a biblical argument for the implementation of work requirements for SNAP and Medicaid benefits. “The Bible is clear, it says if a man doesn’t work, he doesn’t deserve,” he claims.
“A work requirement is just another hoop for people to jump through, if you’ve seen the actual SNAP application, it’s like 15 pages long. You don’t easily get into the program, it takes a lot of work,” said Heather Wachendorf, minister of New Beginnings Christian Church in Urbandale. “And if you’re involved in recertification and you’re out there trying to find a job or a better paying job, it’s another job just to ensure you have what you need.”
Wachendorf’s parish opened up a “community food closet” in part to address some of the shortcomings of the food pantry system. 
“Most food pantries are part of a network and you can only go to one food pantry in the network, once a month. And when you go, you only get three days worth of food. And so that just leaves a really big gap,” Wachendorf said. “We decided to open up our food closet to be a give what you can, take what you need model.”
In addition to addressing a specific need, by keeping the closet accessible and unmonitored 24/7, Wachendorf believes this model allows people to “maintain their dignity and their privacy.” Wachendorf’s parish partners with other churches to combine efforts in addressing food insecurity in their communities including St. Andrew’s Episcopal Church.

Every Friday morning, Gillman’s and Wachendorf’s communities get together to “rescue” food from the Iowa Events Center, repackage it into individual meals and split the food evenly between the two communities’ food closets. Gillman says these meals are especially important for consumers on the go, “like many of our houseless friends,” who can utilize the microwave at the nearby gas station to enjoy a warm meal free of charge.
Gillman says that churches are partnering with their communities to do all they can but “Des Moines is getting hungrier and hungrier.” 
“I see all these comments on social media saying ‘the churches will take care of it, the churches will take care of the people,’ and we are doing the best that we can now but we don’t have the infrastructure to take care of these needs that keep popping up and popping up,” Gillman said.  
She encourages every church in a metro area to have a community fridge because “it is the best way neighbors can share their gifts and provisions with one another,” but also it allows parishioners “to meet each other.” She says the space created by the community fridge has led to her meeting many of the local families and creating space for neighbors to “hang out.” 
Concerns about health care
Another exacerbating issue for Gillman is that many of the individuals reliant on the churches’ feeding programs are members of the “sandwich generation,” meaning they are taking care of both young children and adults whom they can’t afford to put into a nursing facility. 
She also said she feels “very afraid,” that these health care cuts may cause closures to nursing homes and rural hospitals. She is also “worried” about the fact that Iowa is an OB-GYN desert and that pregnant mothers may not be able to get the care they need.
“Medicaid is not full of people who are trying to game the system, it’s full of people who are hoping to someday not need Medicaid,” said Monnet “The structure of our laws and the structure for exemption and our minimum wage laws and other employment laws are such that somebody can be working full time and still not afford their own insurance.”
Monnet presides over all Episcopal churches in the state of Iowa. She expressed concerns that people will lose their medical coverage as a result of “onerous documenting requirements.” She said that the U.S. is looking at Medicaid policy backwards by saying “the only people who deserve healthcare are the ones who can earn it somehow,” rather than fostering a healthy society through providing health care to those in need. 
“If I look at Jesus and I look at what he did, during his lifetime, he healed whoever came to him. It didn’t matter if they were rich or poor, it didn’t matter if they were from the immediate community or far away,” Monnet said. “People would bring him people from all over the place and he would heal them because health is important to God.”

Harold Pope announced Monday his entry to seek the Democratic nomination in 2026 for the state’s second-highest executive position: lieutenant governor.,"Sen. Harold Pope at the legislative session in March 2025. Pope annouced his candidacy for lieutenant governor on Tuesday, July 14, 2025. (Danielle Prokop / Source NM)New Mexico Sen. Harold Pope announced Monday his entry to seek the Democratic nomination in 2026 for the state’s second-highest executive position: lieutenant governor.
Voters reelected Pope to a second term in November to represent Albuquerque’s far northwest side, having won his first term in 2021.
Pope told Source NM in a call that he was proud of his legislative efforts, but said federal cuts to Medicaid, food benefits, educational funding and environmental deregulation will have wide-ranging impacts to New Mexicans.
“I just feel like I can do more in the executive position of lieutenant governor working for the governor full time,” Pope said. “I think, more importantly, it’s having someone at the table on the fourth floor being a voice for New Mexicans, and that’s really what I want to be.”
The lieutenant governor holds executive and legislative roles. The position ranks second-in-command and stands in for governors during absences. The lieutenant governor also serves as president of the New Mexico State Senate, overseeing the body’s business during the legislative session and determining issues of decorum or rules. The state’s Constitution grants the lieutenant governor tie-breaker vote power in the Senate.
Pope, who retired from the U.S. Air Force as a captain in 2018, has a background in biochemistry. He also has three master’s degrees (business administration from the University of New Mexico; operational leadership at the Air Force Air Command and Staff College; and pharmaceutical chemistry from the University of Florida) and announced in January he’s seeking a doctorate in education at Vanderbilt University.
Pope said his lived experience of having to use federal aid programs in his childhood and his time in the military offers a perspective that can speak to the importance of the programs.
“Quite frankly, we’re in a fight for our states,” he said.
Pope is the third Democratic candidate registered with the Secretary of State’s Office for the June 2, 2026 Democratic primary election, joining  current Land Commissioner Stephanie Garcia Richard, who is termed-out of that position; and Jackie Onsuarez, a nuclear waste engineer and Village Councilor from Loving, New Mexico.
One Republican candidate has also filed paperwork for the position: Manuel Lardizabal, a former candidate for the New Mexico Senate. Statewide candidates have until Feb. 2, 2026 to file to get on the ballot.
Pope enters the campaign with a little more than  $10,000 transferred from his Senate account, according to campaign finance documents. Pope said he was unaware of a $3,100 fine listed by the Secretary of State’s office for an outstanding filing, and said he had turned in the paperwork.
Garcia Richard’s cash balance was a little over $32,000, according to April filings, and neither Onsuarez nor Lardizabal have recorded any contributions or expenditures yet.
Following the primary, the winning governor and lieutenant governor candidates for each party will run on the same ticket during the Nov. 4, 2026 general election.
So far, three Democratic candidates have announced their bid for governor: Deb Haaland, the former U.S. Secretary of the interior and congresswomen; Sam Bregman, the 2nd Judicial District District attorney; and Ken Miyagashima, the former mayor of Las Cruces. Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham is term-limited from running again.
In the Running: Who’s in, who’s out for the 2026 NM governor race

Rio Rancho Mayor Gregg Hull is the only declared Republican candidate for mayor. Several others have filed paperwork while weighing campaigns, including: Duke Rodriguez, CEO of Ultra Heath Cannabis and a former cabinet secretary for former Republican Gov. Gary Johnson; Brian Cillessen, a 53- year-old Farmington resident, veteran and hunting show host; and Las Cruces-based fitness instructor, Belinda Robertson.
There’s one decline-to-state candidate: Gene Pettit, a nondenominational pastor in Radium Springs.
Pope said he would not endorse any of the three Democratic candidates in the gubernatorial race. “At the end of the day, the voters are going to have to make that selection, and whoever that is, I believe I will make the Democratic ticket stronger as the candidate,” he said.

This story was originally reported by Chabeli Carrazana of The 19th.
Two years ago, Nicolle Orozco Forero walked into an in-home day care in Seattle, Washington, looking for a job. She was barely 22, a whole five feet tall — if that. But she was calm, focused. Her presence struck the owner, Stephanie Wishon, because it’s not easy to find qualified staff who can work with children with disabilities.
Orozco Forero had experience working with kids who had autism back in Colombia, so Wishon had her come in for a trial run and hired her after the first day. The children, who needed someone who had love and care to give in abundance, gravitated toward her. She was good at the hardest stuff. She changed diapers and outfits the moment they were soiled. She was vigilant; her kids stayed pristine. And she got them to do the things they wouldn’t do for other people, like say “ah” when it was time to get their teeth brushed or sit still long enough for her to twist a braid down their back.
Some people just have that way about them.
And people like Orozco Forero are exceptionally rare. Already, the staffing shortage in child care is near crisis levels. It’s far worse for children with disabilities — about a third of those families say they face significant difficulty finding care for their kids, partly because there are too few people with the ability, expertise or desire to work with their children. Immigrant women like Orozco Forero have been helping to fill that void. They now make up 20 percent of all child care workers.
At home, Orozco Forero was also caring for her own young boys, one of whom started to show symptoms of a serious illness over the past two years that doctors have not yet been able to diagnose. She took some time off to care for him last year, before returning to the kids at Wishon’s day care.
Her work has kept an already precarious safety net together. Without women like Orozco Forero, families who have nowhere else to turn for care have to make difficult decisions about how to survive and keep their children safe. Without her, the safety net snaps.
And that’s exactly what happened on June 18, the day she was detained.
It was supposed to be a routine meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Orozco Forero and her husband had been to all their monthly meetings for the past year and change, since their asylum charge was denied in April 2024.
The family — Orozco Forero; her husband, Juan Sebastian Moreno Acosta; and their two sons, Juan David, 7, and Daniel, 5 — fled Colombia two years ago. Moreno Acosta, a street vendor, had been persecuted by gangs who target vendors for money.
After arriving in the United States, they sought the help of a lawyer with their asylum claim, but when they couldn’t pay his full fee ahead of their hearing, he pulled out. They represented themselves in court and lost the case. With no knowledge of the U.S. court system, they didn’t know they had 30 days to appeal the ruling, either. Ever since, ICE has been monitoring them, requiring they wear a wrist tracker and meet with an immigration officer once a month, sometimes more, according to a family member. (The 19th is not naming the family member to protect their identity.) It’s unclear why ICE has allowed them to stay in the country all this time, though it’s not necessarily uncommon; ICE typically prioritized immigrants with felonies for deportation.
Orozco Forero had seen the reports of undocumented immigrants being rounded up at their immigration appointments. President Donald Trump’s mass deportation effort has led to the detention of about 30,000 migrants with no criminal record, like Orozco Forero, who now make up about half of those detained. Her husband does have a misdemeanor reckless driving conviction for driving under the influence of alcohol on his record, but he completed a court-mandated alcohol course for that and has no other convictions.
Still, Orozco Forero wasn’t worried when she headed to her appointment on the morning of June 18. If ICE planned to detain her, Orozco Forero thought, they would have asked her to come with the boys, right?
And she had been doing everything right: She’d gone to all her appointments, taken documentation to show she was going to school at Green River Community College taking courses in English and early childhood education. She had completed a child care internship that trained her to open her own licensed in-home day care. Her licensure approval was set to arrive any moment, likely that same week, and the day care was just about ready to go.
But that morning, her family was still wary, asking her to share her location just in case.
Shortly after 10 a.m., Orozco Forero texted her family member: “They are going to deport us”
“Nicolle what happened? Nicolle answer me,” they texted back. “What do I do?”
“I can’t speak I feel like I’m going to faint,” Orozco Forero replied. And then: “I’m sorry it wasn’t what we expected.”
Two-and-a-half hours west, on the coast of Washington in a town called Southbend, Wishon was frantic. Orozco Forero had texted her, too. ICE was asking for the boys.
In two years, Wishon had grown incredibly close to Orozco Forero, who had cared for her own kids. After her family moved to the coast, Wishon rented out her house in Seattle to Orozco Forero, whose boys were excited to have a home with a yard.
Wishon’s husband, Gabriel, hopped into his truck and headed to Seattle. Wishon, meanwhile, got on the phone with the Orozco Forero family’s ICE agent and every lawyer she could. They were going to take them into detention at a facility 2,200 miles away in Texas, a facility that was reopened earlier this year by the Trump administration to detain families. Wishon wanted to find a lawyer who could stop the deportation order, and she wanted to make sure the boys would be reunited with their parents if they took them to meet the ICE agent.

And that was especially important, not just because they were young children, but because Juan David is still sick.
For the past year, he’s been seeking treatment at Seattle Children’s Hospital for an illness that is turning his urine muddy. So far, doctors have determined he’s losing red blood cells and protein through his urine, indicating a possible kidney issue, but they haven’t yet zeroed in on what is causing the problem. They likely need a kidney biopsy to be sure.
“Given the complexity of his case, it is essential that Juan remain in the United States for continued testing and treatment,” his nephrologist Jordan Symons wrote in a March letter to ICE. “We kindly request that you consider this medical necessity in your review of his immigration status and grant him the ability to stay in the United States until his treatment and evaluation are completed.”
Juan David’s care team has been monitoring him closely to ensure his red blood cell and protein levels never drop too low. His condition could become serious quickly.
“You can die from that,” said Sarah Kasnick, a physician’s assistant who is familiar with his case. Kasnick is also a foster parent, and Orozco Forero provided care for her family.
When Gabriel Wishon arrived to pick up the boys, they were confused and disoriented. Where were their parents? Why was everyone crying? They didn’t want to go to Colombia, they told him on the drive. They wanted to stay in the United States.
Around 5:30 p.m. that evening, he met with the ICE agent, who had waited past her work hours for them to arrive.
“Bye boys, you are going to see your parents right now. They are right inside,” Wishon told them. He watched them walk in carrying two stuffed animals, a Super Mario doll and Chase, the popular cartoon dog dressed as a police officer.
The families Orozco Forero cares for are now in a free fall.
Jessica Cocson, whose son has been in Orozco Forero’s care for more than a year, described her in a character letter to ICE as a “blessing to us in ways I struggle to fully express.”
Orozco Forero and her husband “support working families, provide quality childcare, and demonstrate compassion and commitment every day,” Cocson wrote. “It is heartbreaking to think that someone who gives so much and asks so little could be forced to leave.”
Tamia Riley, whose two sons with autism were also in Orozco Forero’s care, said losing her was like watching “a father walking out the door.”
“These people, these day care providers, sitters, they are a form of family members for me and my children,” Riley said.
Now, the day care she was set to open lays empty. Inside, the walls are plastered with posters listing colors and sight words. There are cushioned mats on the floor and play stations. Tables with tiny chairs. A tall pink dollhouse. High chairs and a pack and play for the babies. Outside, two play houses, a ball pit, toys to ride on and little picnic tables set across an artificial turf. But no children to enjoy any of it.
Big Dreams Day Care she was going to call it, for the dreams she wanted the kids in her care to strive for, and the ones that were finally coming to fruition for her.
Orozco Forero’s detention has rattled child care workers across the country. In Texas, workers represented by the Service Employees International Union have been rallying in her name. U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, a Texas Democrat, spoke in support of the family’s release at a rally on June 29 in San Antonio. And a group of union workers is attempting to deliver supplies to the family. It’s an effort Orozco Forero knows little about; she only has limited communication with those on the outside.
Tricia Schroeder, the president of the Seattle-based SEIU chapter that represents care workers, said that, for years unions like hers have been working to improve quality, access and affordability in child care, a system in such deep crisis it’s been called by the Treasury Department “a textbook example of a broken market.”
Immigrant women like Orozco Forero were part of that effort to improve access, doing jobs few Americans want to take on.
“Detaining child care providers, especially those who care for kids with special needs, just deepens the crisis in early learning,” Schroeder said.

Orozco Forero was also the connective tissue that kept families employed. Her loss has rippled across industries.
Kasnick, the foster parent, said one of the children in her care had been tentatively set to start at Orozco Forero’s day care as soon as it opened. Orozco Forero had been the only provider who would take the child, who has autism and is nonverbal.
Orozco Forero had cared for the girl at Wishon’s day care as if she was her own, even taking her in once when the child’s care had fallen through and no foster family in the entire county would take her in because of the complexity of her needs. The girl arrived at Orozco Forero’s house at midnight on a weekend “with no clothing, toys, medication or any of her belongings … this did not [deter] Nicolle and Sebastian instead they immediately went and purchased all the things” the child needed, a social worker wrote in a letter to ICE. Kasnick said Orozco Forero was even considering becoming a foster parent.
Without her, Kasnick is out of options: She quit her job as a physician’s assistant to care for the child after Orozco Forero was detained.
“There are now 44 patients a day who don’t have anyone to provide their health care, and I can’t go to work because Nicolle’s day care didn’t open,” Kasnick said.
In the weeks since, Kasnick has had an overwhelming feeling of helplessness, she said. How could this happen to someone who gave back so much?
“The security of knowing that you can be in your home one day and in a prison the next week, and you didn’t do anything except exist?” she said. “It makes you feel like there’s no good left in the world.”
Orozco Forero’s family was in ICE detention for nearly a month awaiting a bond hearing they hoped could buy them time in the United States. Orozco Forero and the boys were together; her husband was in the same facility but separated from them.
Juan David wasn’t eating much. It took three weeks for him to receive medical care, Orozco Forero told her attorney, James Costo.
Costo had been working to get the details of why ICE allowed the family to stay in the country with monitoring after they lost their asylum case last year. There has been an order for their deportation since then, but ICE never attempted to deport them until the Trump administration ramped up efforts. The number of immigrants without criminal convictions who have been detained has doubled since May.
The process to fight an asylum claim and appeal a denial is complicated — there are court deadlines, documents that need to be submitted and translated.
“They think maybe they can do it themselves and go in and say what happened but they are not understanding the whole legal process,” Costo said. “The system isn’t made for things to be easy.”
Costo was hopeful a judge will allow them to stay in the country temporarily as Juan David seeks care. They have almost no family left in Colombia, and no way to obtain care for him there, their family said.
But on Thursday, Wishon got word that the family had been deported. The family arrived distraught at the home of the only close family they have in Bogotá, the capital.
Daniel, Orozco Forero’s youngest son, sent Wishon a voice message: “Good evening Stephanie, um, we are good. My mommy is very sad,” his little voice tells her.”Thank you for everything you have done for us. God bless you.”
A GoFundMe she set up will be used toward supporting the family as they try to transition to life in Colombia and seek care for Juan David.
A collection of support letters they hoped would move a judge somewhere to hear their case now only remain as chronicles of their impact. In the letters, Juan David’s first grade teachers call him an exceptional student who went from one of the lowest reading levels in the class — 10 words a minute — to one of the highest at 70 words a minute.
“He shows the qualities of a model citizen at a young age — dependable, ethical, and hard-working,” wrote his teacher, Carla Trujillo.
They were all on their way to shaping a better life, Wishon wrote in hers. The couple “worked tirelessly to build a better life for their children and to open their own licensed child care business. In all my years of employing and mentoring caregivers, I have rarely met a couple as responsible, driven, and capable as Nicolle and Sebastian.”
“This family is not a threat,” she concluded. “They are an asset.”",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/childcare-detention01-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

The elections panel’s unanimous vote confirms the preliminary outcome of the special Democratic primary, which saw North Providence Town Councilor Stefano Famiglietti triumph over his three opponents with a decisive 68% percent of the vote — more than 52 percentage points ahead of second-place finisher, Marcia Ranglin-Vassell. 
Considered the frontrunner in the primary, Famiglietti served on the North Providence Town Council since 2018, receiving endorsements from the Senate District 4 Democratic Committee, the Rhode Island AFL-CIO and Senate Majority Leader Frank Ciccone. He will now face the sole Republican candidate, Alexander Asermely, in an Aug. 5 general election.
Asermely, 39, a lawyer, is a first-time candidate for elected office and is backed by the Rhode Island Republican Party. 
The special election fills the seat left open by Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, who died in April. Whoever wins the upcoming Aug. 5 general election will serve the rest of Ruggerio’s two-year term, through 2026, with a $19,817 annual salary.
There are 22,214 registered voters in the district, which spans North Providence and a section of northern Providence. A majority of them, roughly 10,000, are registered Democrats, while another 9,700 are unaffiliated, with the remainder registered as Republicans, according to data from the Rhode Island Department of State. Registered Republicans had to disaffiliate in order to vote in the July 8 Democratic primary under state election rules.
Just over half of the 2,445 voters who participated in the primary cast ballots on primary day at one of four designated polling places. The other half were divided equally between early voting at city or town hall, and mail ballots.
Ranglin-Vassell, a former state representative and Providence Public Schools teacher, received more than 15% of the vote overall, but more than half of the support from voters at the sole Providence polling place.  Famiglietti, 33, a lawyer,  led in all three North Providence polling places with 60-80% of the votes, according to official election results.
Lenny Cioe, 66, a nurse, finished third with 11.5% of votes. Manny Taveras, 40, brother of former Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, received less than 5% of votes. 
Early voting for the special general election starts Wednesday and runs through Monday, Aug. 4, with weekday hours for district voters at Providence City Hall and North Providence Town Hall. More information is available on the Rhode Island Department of State website. 
Board of Elections Chairperson Jennie Johnson and members Randall Jackvony and Michael Connors were absent from the meeting Tuesday.

(Courtesy of the Utah State Department of Corrections)Utah Department of Corrections officials say they’ll be ready to carry out the upcoming execution of death row inmate Ralph Menzies that’s currently scheduled to take place shortly after midnight on Sept. 5. 
A Utah judge signed Menzies’ death warrant last week, setting the date for the 67-year-old man with dementia to die by firing squad. That is, barring any other legal hurdles.  
Capital punishment is “one of the most consequential duties any state agency or department is called upon to fulfill, and our department stands ready to do just that,” Jared Garcia, executive director of the Utah Department of Corrections, told reporters from the department’s training academy in Draper.
“We will carry out the statutory requirements in a professional and respectful manner,” Garcia said, adding that state officials have “now officially started” to prepare. 
It’s been less than a year since Utah’s last execution, when state officials put death row inmate Taberon Honie to death by lethal injection on Aug. 7. Now, state officials are gearing up to do it again — but this time with .30 caliber rifles. 
Judge sets date for Ralph Menzies to die by firing squad as attorneys say his dementia is worsening

“Because we went through this last year, we’ve confirmed our processes at (the new state prison in Salt Lake City), and we feel very comfortable in being able to see this through in a very similar fashion,” Garcia said. “The method will be different, as this will be a firing squad execution as opposed to lethal injection, but again we are confident in our planning and process (from) last year, and we’ll be able to adjust the logistics.” 
Menzies, when he was sentenced to death more than 40 years ago for the murder of Maurine Hunsaker, chose to die by firing squad. Menzies was convicted of the murder in 1988, after he kidnapped Hunsaker, a 26-year-old gas station clerk, and took her up Big Cottonwood Canyon where she was later found tied to a tree with her throat slashed. 
Though a date has been set, Menzies’ attorneys are still pursuing appeals. A judge later this month will decide whether he should undergo another mental evaluation before the execution. Menzies’ attorneys argue his dementia has worsened since he was last evaluated about a year ago. Based on those reports, the judge determined last month that Menzies did have cognitive shortcomings but did not meet the high bar to be deemed incompetent.
Both state and federal law require that death row inmates have an understanding of why they’re being executed. 
Menzies’ attorneys argue he can no longer articulate the state’s reasoning for pursuing the death penalty and even has trouble with basic tasks like getting his food, getting dressed and cleaning his cell. State attorneys, however, argue Menzies’ execution should be allowed to proceed. Daniel Boyer, who represented the state last week, told reporters he doesn’t think there’s enough in the Menzies’ petition to warrant another evaluation.

Last week, Menzies’ attorney Eric Zuckerman called the notion of executing his client “inhumane.”
“He’s tethered to a wheelchair and an oxygen tank. And he’s not competent. This has gotten worse over the past year and we remain hopeful that the courts or the clemency board will recognize the inhumanity of taking a man like him into the death chair, taking him out of his wheelchair, and executing him,” Zuckerman said outside the courtroom. “It’s wrong and Utah can do better.” 
But Matt Hunsaker, Maurine’s son, applauded the judge’s decision to sign the death warrant Wednesday, telling reporters he was feeling “overwhelmed” and “very happy.” 
“His life will be over in mere seconds,” Hunsaker said when asked how he’s preparing for the execution. “My mom, we don’t know how long she stood and suffered in that grove, how long she bled to death and how she felt.” 
Why is Menzies set to be executed by firing squad?
In Utah, death row inmates sentenced before May 2004 had a choice between lethal injection or firing squad. Menzies, when he was sentenced to death, chose the firing squad. For those sentenced after 2004, the default method of execution is lethal injection, unless the necessary drugs are not available.
In the courtroom in 1988, when asked how he preferred to die after he was sentenced to death, the Deseret News reported: “Menzies replied loudly: ‘Shoot me.’”
Though it’s been less than 12 months since Utah’s last execution, it’s been more than 15 years since Utah officials carried out an execution by firing squad. 
Ronnie Lee Gardner was the last inmate to be executed by firing squad in Utah, on June 18, 2010. Gardner was convicted of murder in 1985 for shooting Michael Burdell, an attorney, and wounding Nick Kirk, a bailiff, in a failed attempt to escape from court, where he was already facing another murder charge.

(Courtesy of the Utah State Department of Corrections)Randy Gardner, who witnessed his brother’s firing squad execution, has become a vocal advocate against the death penalty, saying witnessing his brother being killed by firing squad traumatized him. 
Randy Gardner was among about two dozen protesters who came to the “free speech zone” about two miles south of Utah’s prison last August when state officials executed Honie by lethal injection.
Utah News Dispatch was among the media witnesses for Honie’s execution. The witnesses agreed the death was quiet, with no outward signs of suffering.
According to media witness accounts of Ronnie Lee Gardner’s execution, he was pronounced dead after one volley of bullets, two minutes after the shots were fired. In those two minutes, reporters said Ronnie Lee Gardner’s left hand clenched into a fist, leaving some media members to wonder briefly whether his execution would require a second volley, which it didn’t. 
It’s been over 15 years since Utah’s last firing squad execution. Will the state be prepared?
Garcia said state officials “absolutely feel like we’re prepared to carry out this type of execution through a firing squad.” 
“The logistics are just a little bit different on how we locate firing squad members, we’re just getting started with that process,” Garcia said. 
He added that Menzies’ execution is set to take place in the same execution chamber where Honie was put to death, but the difference is rather than being strapped to a gurney for a lethal injection, Menzies will be tied down to a chair. 
Cost of Utah’s execution of Taberon Honie topped $288K, not including legal expenses

State officials say they plan to largely adhere to the same protocol as that 2010 execution, with the only difference being that it will take place at the execution chamber in the new Utah State Correctional Facility, located in Salt Lake City’s remote northwest corner. That facility replaced the now-demolished Utah State Prison in Draper in 2022. 
For a firing squad execution, Utah law requires the executive director of the Utah Department of Corrections or a designee to select a “five-person firing squad of peace officers.” 
When asked how those firing squad members will be recruited, Garcia said “that’s still yet to be determined. We’re still working through that.” 
Pressed on whether state officials will be establishing a protocol for that, Garcia said, “Yes, we definitely want to make sure that they are people that are, first of all, mentally prepared to participate in this type of assignment.” 
“As you can imagine, it shouldn’t be taken lightly,” he said, adding that state officials “want to make sure that they are skilled” marksmen. 
“I want to make sure that this … goes through in a professional and dignified way, and that we do it right,” Garcia said. 
Utah’s firing squad protocol
According to the Utah Department of Correction’s 2010 execution protocol, “persons selected for the firing squad shall be POST certified peace officers. Selected peace officers will be required to demonstrate proficiency with weapons designated to carry out the execution.” 
Proficiency, the protocol says, must be shown by firing .30 caliber weapons “at a minimum of 21 feet, accurately hitting the target of the same dimension as that which will be attached to the condemned.” 
The protocol calls for an “aiming point or target to be placed over the condemned inmate’s heart.” 
“During the proficiency test, failure to accurately hit the specified target with one round from each weapon fired shall disqualify the officer,” the protocol says. 
State officials will keep the shooters’ identities secret. The firing squad protocol requires that of the five weapons used for the execution, four will be loaded with two live rounds while one will be loaded with two blank rounds. 
“Care shall be taken to preclude any knowledge by the members of the firing squad of who is issued the weapon with two blank cartridges,” the protocol says.
In addition to that five-person execution team, the protocol also requires that “two alternates and a team leader shall be chosen.” The alternates “shall be selected to replace any member(s) of the firing squad who are unable to discharge their required functions.” 
The protocol also requires that a “minimum of three rehearsals and practices shall be conducted to carry out an execution in a timely fashion maintaining the necessary security.” 
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
For the execution, the protocol requires “a designated execution team member” to “start a stopwatch once the first volley has been fired.” If, after the first rounds are fired, the death row inmate appears to be unconscious, the protocol requires the warden to “wait a maximum of three minutes after the first volley and then call for the physician to check the vital signs of the condemned.” 
“If, after a maximum of 10 minutes from the first volley, the inmate is unconscious but alive, the Warden shall direct the physician to make a final check on the condemned vital signs,” the protocol says. If the inmate is found to still be alive, the protocol directs the executive director or a designee to order the firing squad team leader to ready the team for a second volley. 
If, after the first round of bullets, the inmate “is obviously conscious,” the protocol requires the executive director to “instruct the firing squad team leader to immediately prepare the weapons to fire again.” 
The protocol calls for those procedures to be repeated until “no vital signs are detected” and the physician certifies the death.

In 2020, the city of Jackson settled its lawsuit with the German company over years of faulty metering for water services. While about a third of the $90 million went to legal fees, city officials couldn’t immediately say where the rest of those funds went during a status conference Monday. 
City Attorney Drew Martin said he was working to comply with a subpoena Wingate issued last week looking for an accounting of the settlement dollars, adding that he would have those details within a day or two. While he couldn’t say for sure where the money went, Martin said the city spent about $50 million within a few months after the settlement, and that there was $8 million remaining as of 2022.

Ted Henifin, who runs JXN Water and first proposed the rate increase in February, said the increase would still be necessary even if the utility received all the money from the Siemens settlement. He said the utility’s day-to-day management is operating at a deficit, and that the $60 million from the settlement — what Jackson received after paying its lawyers — would only cover losses for the next two years. 
Henifin added that he’s asking the federal government to move around its funding to the city so he can spend more of it on operations and management. Without a boost to JXN Water’s finances, he said the utility would have to stop paying its contractors.    
Wingate inquired about the settlement money during a two-day status conference last month. Henifin told the judge he had no idea what the city did with the funds. Wingate explained Monday that he wanted to make sure he was aware of all possible funding for JXN Water before approving a second rate increase in as many years. 
It’s unclear how soon he’ll decide. In addition to Jackson officials, Wingate issued the subpoena on July 9 to the state and federal government as well as four different law firms. The subpoena gives the parties 30 days to produce any information on where the settlement funds went.
The judge also brought up the city’s history with shutting off nonpaying customers. Martin explained that the city, under then Mayor Tony Yarber, agreed to pause shutoffs for customers who had issues with Siemens’ water meters. Jackson prepared to bring back shutoffs in 2019, he said, but put them on hold again during the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/06100123/3X0A3827-scaled.jpg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

It symbolizes opening the door to happiness, unity and prosperity. (Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)DE SOTO — Hundreds from around the world gathered Monday to celebrate the grand opening of the Panasonic electric vehicle battery plant in De Soto and tour the 4.7 million-square-foot facility that claims the tag of the state’s biggest economic development project ever.
The Japanese ambassador to the United States, Panasonic leaders, and local, regional and national elected officials praised the partnership required to bring the project to fruition. Panasonic is expected to invest $4 billion in the plant, and the Kansas Department of Commerce estimates it will bring $2.5 billion to the state’s economy annually.
The state offered $829 million in incentives to Panasonic through the Attracting Powerful Economic Expansion Act, or APEX.
“Just two and a half years ago, November 22, we stood on this very ground,” said Allan Swan, president and chief operating officer of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America. “At that point, it was just a big open field, but we had a whole vision to build a world-class facility that would power the future of clean transportation, create thousands of jobs, new high-quality jobs, and serve as the catalyst for economic growth in Kansas and across the region.”
“Today,” he said, “that vision is a reality.”
One week ago, the first production line began operating, and it will take three to four months for it to achieve full capacity, Swan said after the ceremony.
By early January, Swan said, three additional lines will be operating and construction will begin on a second wing of the building, which is expected to house an additional four lines in about 18 months.
Currently, the plant makes about 50,000 batteries per day — at a rate of about 70 per second — and employs 1,100 people, Swan said. It is expected to employ 4,000 people when at full capacity.
Reports by international media that decreased Tesla sales will delay the move to full capacity are just part of being in a new business, Swan said.
“We’re in a brand new industry,” he said. “That industry is going to ebb and flow a little bit as she grows, and she will grow, and we’re clearly growing in one direction. It’s not going to change. The beauty of Kansas is we can build these lines out. We’ve got customers that want them, so we should be in a good place.”
Batteries won’t begin to ship out to customers for three or four weeks because of rigorous safety and quality testing, Swan said.

The marketplace
Customers who will use the electric vehicle batteries in their products were in attendance, including representatives from Lucid Motors, Toyota, Harbinger Motors and Tesla. Nick Twork, spokesman for Lucid, said they were pleased to see a new plant built. 
“It’s really great because obviously it allows us to have a domestic supply chain for battery cells,” he said. “This facility will start supplying us next year, and we’ll ship batteries to our factory in Arizona.”
Upcoming changes to U.S. policies, like eliminating tax credits for buying electric cars, aren’t really something that concerns Lucid, Twork said.
“As long as it’s a level playing field, that’s the most important thing,” he said. “Obviously that’s going to affect the marketplace, so we’ll adapt as necessary. We’re an agile business, and we’ll do what it takes.”
Twork said he wasn’t willing to comment on any acrimony the public is feeling about Tesla products and reports the company’s sales are down.
“From our standpoint, we’ve had six consecutive quarters of record growth for the company,” he said. “We keep selling more vehicles, so more and more customers are finding out about
what Lucid has to offer.”

Supply chains
U.S. Sen. Jerry Moran spoke at the ceremony and afterward said trade negotiations need to take place to get rid of barriers that keep U.S. products out of international markets.
“But as I’ve indicated to the ambassador today, we’re going to do everything we can to make sure that the outcome of those conversations between Japan and the United States are beneficial to both countries,” Moran said.
The federal government wants supply chains brought home, he said.
“This is an example of where business that was being done outside the United States will now be done in the United States,” he said of the Panasonic plant.
Swan said Panasonic is working to bring more suppliers to locate in the United States. Three already have space in the De Soto plant.
“It’s an ongoing process, and we’ll keep working with our suppliers who already exist to see whether we can get them here to the United States, or find another way of creating a stronger supply chain,” Swan said.
There are still 6,000 acres near the plant that could be used for expansion or where suppliers could build. Swan said the company would like to see that developed and is working with the state of Kansas to bring suppliers “as close as possible.”
Swan praised the De Soto plant as the largest plant his company has built with top-of-the-line manufacturing capabilities.
“We built the first one with Tesla over in Nevada, so that’s their factory. This is our factory,” he said. “We’ve redesigned it to make it quite more productive. There is roughly 10% less machinery here and a lot more automation, so that’s where the innovation comes in. The lines here are the fastest lines that we’ve ever had.”
The labor-saving production lines are expected to achieve approximately 20% higher productivity compared to the Nevada factory, a press release said.

Workforce training
All of those who spoke Monday highlighted the partnerships that it took to make such a large project successful. Speakers repeatedly mentioned the collaboration with local community colleges to help the company train the workforce it needs.
Greg Mosier, president of the Kansas City Kansas Community College, said new programs at the school train Panasonic’s entry level skilled maintenance technicians and advanced engineering technicians.
The program is a mix of schooling at the community college and working at the Panasonic plant, he said.
“We developed it in partnership with Panasonic, and then it’s also 16 credit hours, so they get a college certificate with it as well,” Mosier said. “It’s an apprenticeship model, so they are on the regular 16-week schedule. They do two days at the college, three days at the factory.”
In response to a Panasonic request, the community college was able to condense the program to eight weeks, he said. After completing the course and working full time at Panasonic, Mosier said, students are earning $50,000 to $60,000 per year.

Japanese investment
The investments Panasonic is making in Kansas will strengthen the state’s economy and do much more, said Yasuaki Takamoto, CEO of Panasonic Energy Corp. of North America.
“What happens here is just the first step in building a stable and secure domestic supply chain, one that’s becoming a reality thanks to our ongoing investment and partnership,” he said. “We are supporting domestic production with critical EV components, strengthening North America’s manufacturing ecosystems and helping America maintain its competitive edge.”
Takamoto said that selecting Kansas for the plant meant choosing the community and the workforce they believed in.
“Since then, we built relationships that will last for years to come,” he said.
Japanese ambassador Shigeo Yamada highlighted the strong relationship between the United States and Japan, saying Japan has been the strongest investor in the United States in the past 50 years and has created 1 million jobs.
“Japanese investment in this country is about much more than just dollars and cents,” he said. “By working hand-in-hand with local communities, Japanese companies are building enduring ties and a sense of trust with their peoples. These personal ties — connections — form the very foundation on which the bilateral relationship is built and allowing us to collaborate, not just as allies, but as trusted friends.”

According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

Two Minnesota counties are among dozens of cities and counties suing over Trump administration threats to tie federal funding for housing and other programs to local policy on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; and abortion. (Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Twenty-eight cities and counties including Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

(Photo by Nicole Neri/Minnesota Reformer)Attorney General Keith Ellison announced Monday that he’s suing the Trump administration after it froze funding for six U.S. Department of Education programs. The freeze could cost Minnesota about $70 million in funding annually — 11.4% of the total Department of Education funding the state is expected to receive, according to the Learning Policy Institute, 
“Donald Trump’s Department of Education is pulling the rug out from under Minnesota students by cutting school funding without warning and right before the start of the school year, and they are violating the law by doing so,” Ellison said in a press release.
Ellison has joined a coalition of 22 other attorneys general and two governors. The lawsuit argues that Congress, not the executive branch, has the power to appropriate funds and that withholding the money violates federal statutes.
The Department of Education told state agencies on June 30 that it did not plan to release the funds — the day before an initial 25% of the money is usually paid out to states. According to the suit, the department said it was withholding funds to “review” the programs’ compliance with the “President’s priorities.”
With the school year less than two months away, the Legislature and local school boards had already made budgets and staffing plans under the assumption that the grants would be allocated as normal. If Minnesota seeks to backfill the missing federal money, that could exacerbate a projected deficit. 
The funding freeze will impact summer school and afterschool programs, teacher training and English learner programs, among other services.
Federal money is a relatively small share of Minnesota education budgets: state funding makes up 64% of education spending in Minnesota, with federal funding providing 8%, and the balance made up by local funding.
Still, educators said they would resist the Trump’s administration’s actions.
“This is not just a budget cut – it’s an assault on the rule of law and our commitment to every child’s right to a quality education,” Monica Byron, president of Education Minnesota, said in a statement on July 1. “Trump is stealing money from classrooms to pay for more tax breaks for billionaires, and Minnesota students will pay the price.”

In a separate case, the board alleged that a Walgreens store located in Marshalltown, identified in federal records as the store at 5 E. Anson St., dispensed a prescription medication on March 27, 2023, for guanfacine, a drug often used to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, for a minor. In filling the prescription, the store mistakenly included one capsule of propranolol, a beta-blocker often used to treat high blood pressure, in the bottle.
The board alleges the store’s quality control records related to the error failed to include the root cause of the incident, the name of the individual that analyzed the event, or the date it was created.

(Photo by Ken Castro/Rhode Island Current)The Mount Hope Bridge will be closed to traffic in both directions for four days next month for a $1 million repaving operation, the Rhode Island Turnpike and Bridge Authority (RITBA) has announced.
The 96-year old bridge linking Bristol and Portsmouth over Mount Hope Bay will be closed to all traffic beginning at 7 p.m. on Thursday, Aug. 14, and will reopen at 5 a.m. Monday, Aug. 18. But if there is any severe weather in the forecast, the project will be rescheduled for a weekend in September, officials said.
Emergency vehicles will not be permitted to cross during the closure, but RITBA has been coordinating with officials in Bristol and Portsmouth about detours.
“We appreciate the public’s patience as we get this work done,” Lori Caron Silveira, RITBA’s executive director, said in a statement. “We know that everyone will welcome a smoother ride over the bridge and hope that the advance notice will help people make their plans to seek alternate routes for that weekend.”
Cumberland-based J.H. Lynch and Sons was awarded a $1.1 million contract by RITBA to smooth the roadway by milling it and applying an ultra-thin bonded overlay between the curbs. A copy of the contract was not immediately made available.
RITBA expects the new surface to last five years — coincidentally around the same time a contractor is expected to begin reconstructing the deck of the bridge, the Bristol Phoenix reported in May.
The state of the Mount Hope bridge has come into question — namely the corroded cables that hold up the roadway. RITBA spokesperson Cara Cromwell confirmed that dehumidification of the cables is a project that will also be scheduled in the future.
Inspection reports on the condition of the existing cables  are not being made public. RITBA declined to release a fall 2024 inspection report to WPRI-12, citing national security concerns, the station reported on June 24.
Cromwell told Rhode Island Current all four of the bridges RITBA operates are considered “essential infrastructure,” so their inspection reports fall under the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Sensitive Security Information designation.
That means only the federal government can authorize the release of the reports. Cromwell said the Mount Hope Bridge was rated “fair” in the fall 2024 inspection report. 
“If the inspection had revealed any urgent issues, we would have been alerted immediately,” Cromwell said. “There were no significant findings.”
RITBA has asked the Department of Homeland Security to review inspection reports for the Mount Hope, Pell, Jamestown Verrazzano, and Sakoner River bridges to determine which, if any, portions can be made public. 
“We will not be able to make public any portion of the report until we hear back,” Cromwell said in an email. “In the meantime, if the inspection had revealed any urgent issues, we would have been alerted immediately.”
A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to request for comment.

Plans to develop one of New England’s largest battery storage facilities on a plot of land in Killingly have fallen through, according to documents submitted to the Connecticut Siting Council.
An attorney for the project, known as Windham Energy Center, notified the siting council in a letter last month that the developer had decided to withdraw its application to build the 325-megawatt facility. The decision came after town officials raised concerns about the proposed facility, particularly the risk of fire, and requested more information from developers.
The attorney, Ken Baldwin, said on Monday that he was not authorized to talk about the project and referred requests for comment to the Israel-based developer, Sunflower Sustainable Investments.
Representatives for that company did not responded to multiple requests for comment.
The company’s decision to withdraw its application was first reported by New London’s The Day newspaper.
It was not the first time developers had sought to use the property, which is located next to existing Eversource transmission lines, to supply power to the regional electric grid.
In 2016, Florida-based NTE Energy proposed building a natural gas-fired power plant on the same location. That plan drew intense criticism from environmental groups, with protests held both in Killingly and at the state Capitol in Hartford.
While the siting council gave its approval to that project in 2019, it continued to be a source of debate for several more years until federal regulators dealt a final blow to NTE’s efforts in 2022. Last year, Windham Energy Center’s developers filed their application to use the site as a battery storage facility.
According to Windham Energy’s application, the project would have cost an estimated $200 million and taken a little more than a year to build. The plans called for lithium-ion batteries housed in dozens of prefabricated storage containers, as well as an electrical substation connecting to the regional grid.
Almost from the start, however, the project faced difficulties due to the fact that NTE Energy continued to hold the certificate of approval from the siting council to develop the property for a power plant — despite having since gone out of business. In November, Baldwin filed a request with the siting council to reopen that approval process for the purpose of resolving the issue.
In the meantime, Killingly officials began to raise a number of concerns about the project in filings made with the siting council. Those concerns touched on noise and gases that could be emitted from the facility, as well as the potential for intense battery fires known as “thermal runaways.”
Local officials asked for the developers to provide more information and, in some cases, to alter their plans to address those concerns — such as through the construction of vegetation barriers. In January, Baldwin indicated that the company was willing to take additional steps to address some of the local concerns.
But before those issues were resolved, Baldwin sent the letter on June 3 withdrawing the application.
Melanie Bachman, the executive director of the siting council, said in her acknowledgment of that letter that Windham Energy would have to submit new applications should it seek to restart the approval process.
Representatives from Killingly, including Acting Town Manager Frances Conroy and Economic Development Director Jill St. Clair, were not available for comment on Monday.

(Photo: Ahmed Jallow)Attorney General Jeff Jackson announced Monday that North Carolina is suing the U.S. Department of Education over its freeze of $165 million in education funding the state, a decision expected to affect more than 1,000 positions and various school programs.
The lawsuit, which was joined by 24 other states, targets the federal government’s decision to withhold more than $6.8 billion nationwide in public school funding.
Jackson announced the lawsuit alongside State Superintendent Maurice “Mo” Green and State Board of Education Chair Eric Davis, warning that the cuts could disrupt after-school programs, mental health services and English language learning support just weeks before the new school year. 
“Congress created these programs and authorized this funding,” Jackson said at a news conference. “The Department of Education does not have the authority to now withhold those funds, certainly not the night before they were set to arrive.” 
“It was a three-sentence email [that] contained basically no detail, and simply said that ‘this money was going to be frozen until further notice,'” Jackson said. “Since then, they have been unwilling to answer our questions.
“If this is not addressed, the impacts will be severe and widespread.”
The lawsuit seeks a preliminary injunction to unblock the frozen grants. 
Local school districts could face emergency measures such as hiring freezes or classroom consolidations, he said. 
“These funds serve, directly and indirectly, hundreds of thousands of our students, including some of the most vulnerable,” said Green.
According to an analysis performed by the North Carolina Justice Center’s Education & Law Project, rural school districts would be disproportionately affected. Nine of the 10 hardest-hit districts by per-student funding cuts are in rural counties, with some districts facing losses of more than $300 per student. Counties still recovering from Hurricane Helene face a combined cut of approximately $18 million. 
Mecklenburg County could lose more than $12.2 million, Wake County over $8 million, and Alamance, Guilford, Forsyth, Cumberland and other counties would each lose millions under the funding freeze.
“These funds are not discretionary. They are allocated specifically to support programs and personnel that are essential for providing a high-quality education to all students,” said Alamance-Burlington School Board Chair Sandy Ellington-Graves at the press conference. 
“Withholding these funds directly undermines our ability to serve our growing population of multilingual learners,” Ellington-Graves said.
The lawsuit is joined by attorneys general from states including California, New York, Michigan, Minnesota and Washington, along with the governors of Pennsylvania and Kentucky. It challenges what plaintiffs describe as an “unlawful and unconstitutional” decision by the Department of Education. 
The Office of Management and Budget, which oversees federal spending, has said that funding pause is related to a review of potential ideological content in some programs. State officials strongly dispute that justification, arguing that Congress already approved the funds and that students and educators should not be caught in the middle. 
“The decision to freeze $165 million in federal funding is an unnecessary and irresponsible act against our children,” Davis said. “Educating our children should rise above politics.” 
The lawsuit comes as North Carolina faces a continuing teacher shortage; nearly 9,000 teachers left the profession during the 2023–24 school year, according to state data.",https://ncnewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7142314-1536x1152-22-1024x845.jpg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

Shelley Moore Capito’s office in Charleston, W.Va., Monday, July 14, 2025. (Lori Kersey | West Virginia Watch)More than a week after President Donald Trump signed the federal legislation into law, demonstrators in Charleston, West Virginia, staged a protest of cuts to federal food assistance and health care in the Big, Beautiful Bill Act Monday afternoon. 
About two dozen protesters gathered outside the downtown office of Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va. Some of them were also expected to go to Republican Sen. Jim Justice’s Charleston office following the demonstration. 
West Virginia’s entire congressional delegation, all Republicans, voted for the budget reconciliation bill, which includes historic cuts to Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. In the Mountain State, nearly 500,000 people get their health care coverage from Medicaid. About 277,000 state residents rely on SNAP. 
“A budget is a moral document, and this one is soaked in cruelty,” Pam Garrison, state tri-chair of the West Virginia Poor People’s Campaign, said during the event. “We come from many traditions, but we share one sacred call to care for the vulnerable, to welcome the stranger, to lift up the common good. Repeal this law. Repair the harm and reinvest in dignity.”
The bill extends and expands a 2017 tax law to keep individual income tax rates at the same level, according to reporting by States Newsroom. It also makes permanent some tax breaks on business investments and research and development costs. To do so, the legislation slashes funding to the Medicaid program and shifts significant costs of SNAP to the states for the first time. 
In a statement Monday, Kelley Moore, a spokeswoman for Capito, said that the senator believes everyone should have the right to make their voices heard in a respectful and peaceful way.
“The Big Beautiful bill, which is now law, focuses on the safety, security and prosperity that the American people want and need,” Moore said. “This comprehensive package reflects the priorities shared with President Trump — who West Virginians overwhelmingly supported in the recent election.”
Nationally, roughly 17 million people are expected to lose their health care by 2034 due to the implementation of work reporting requirements for Medicaid recipients and changes to the Affordable Care Act marketplace, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. 
In West Virginia, about at least 75,000 Medicaid recipients are expected to lose their coverage, according to an analysis by Repairers of the Breach. The bill will increase the state’s cost of SNAP benefits based on their error rate. If those costs are based on the state’s 2024 error rate, it would cost West Virginia more than $50 million, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Art Lane, of Belle, was among the about two dozen people who participated in the protest. 
He pointed to research by Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania that estimates the legislation could lead to 51,000 deaths per year due to loss of health care coverage, disenrollment of 1.38 million low-income Medicare beneficiaries and the repeal of federal nursing home staffing rules. 
“Think how many of [those deaths] are going to be West Virginians?” Lane said. “West Virginia is one of the most neediest states in the country, and there’s so many people here, so many families who depend on SNAP, who depend on Medicaid, so many disabled people, elderly people.”
“I’m out here fighting for the people and standing up for the people who are less fortunate,” he said. 
The protest was part of a series of events held in 11 southern states by the Repairers of the Breach, a national organization led by Bishop William J. Barber II that supports “moral leaders who uplift our deepest moral and constitutional values to redeem the heart and soul of America.” 
“Everyone that they hurt with this bill, we will organize,” Barber said in a statement Monday. “Through Jim Crow, the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and beyond, history has consistently taught us that the poorest and most marginalized communities have a profound ability to create change — even when the future seems the bleakest. Today is no different. Yes, lawmakers have succeeded in codifying one of the most morally-bankrupt pieces of legislation in our history. But in doing so, they’ve laid the groundwork for a movement that is truly by and for poor and working class people. If we mobilize just a fraction of these people, we can transform our nation’s entire landscape.”
Similar demonstrations were held in Alabama, Mississippi, Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Louisiana, Virginia and North Carolina.

Article Summary

Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order requiring state agencies to come up with plans to respond to tariffs.
President Donald Trump is set to implement new tariffs after previously pausing them for three months.
The order requires agencies to evaluate impacts on costs, the availability of supplies, and the ability to complete projects within a given timeline.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


SPRINGFIELD — Gov. JB Pritzker signed an executive order Monday requiring Illinois agencies to draft recommendations to respond to tariffs being implemented by President Donald Trump.

The order requires seven state agencies to “consider the specific impacts that the U.S. tariffs have had on Illinois and provide draft recommendations of measures to mitigate the impact of these tariffs” within the next 100 days, which would be Oct. 22.

Pritzker said in a statement that tariffs amount to a tax increase on consumers and contribute to economic uncertainty.

“This Executive Order ensures we have a clear-eyed view of the impact the Trump Slump will cause from higher prices at the grocery store to uncertainty in our farms and factories,” Pritzker said. “We’re working with other states to stand up for working people and protect our economies when we can.”

The order cites large tariffs Trump has unilaterally implemented on most countries, including some of Illinois’ largest trading partners, saying the tariffs have raised prices for consumers and businesses and led to supply chain disruptions. The order says tariffs as well as retaliatory tariffs countries have imposed on the United States are hurting “vital sectors of the Illinois economy.”

After previously pushing off implementation of some tariffs until Aug. 1 to allow time for negotiations, Trump announced last week many countries will see tariffs take effect. His latest policy includes 35% tariffs on Canada, 30% on Mexico and the European Union,  and between 25% and 40% on many Asian countries. The president previously imposed 145% tariffs on goods from China in the spring, but many of his latest rates are lower than they would have been earlier this year.

Illinois imports more goods from Canada than any other country.

Order’s requirements

Under Pritzker’s executive order, state agencies must examine the impact of tariffs on certain sectors of the economy or the agency’s operations.

The departments of Commerce and Economic Opportunity and Employment Security will evaluate challenges reported by businesses, employment trends since tariffs have been implemented, and industries most affected by tariffs.

The Department of Human Services will evaluate trends in food donations and supply chain challenges for food assistance programs, as well as the purchasing power of food banks and their ability to meet demand.

The Department of Transportation and the Capitol Development Board will assess the impact of tariffs on construction costs, and the ability to purchase construction materials and complete projects within their timelines.

The Illinois Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security will evaluate any impacts to stockpiles and the ability to obtain supplies, including staying prepared for emergencies within budget constraints.

Pritzker’s executive order was part of actions taken by seven Democratic governors to understand the impact of tariffs on their states.

The justices on Monday sent the legislators’ request for their intervention to the Second Judicial Circuit. However, the justices noted that the transfer should not be read as a judgment on the merits of the Democrats’ suit.
However, the transfer likely will have the effect of delaying resolution of the case.
“We look forward to fighting in any court,” Orlando Democratic Rep. Anna Eskamani wrote in a text message to Florida Phoenix. She is one of five state legislators who were denied entry when they tried to conduct an oversight visit on July 3 to the detention center in the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
Democrats describe ‘really disturbing’ conditions after Everglades immigrant detention center tour

After the denial, the Florida Division of Emergency Management, the state agency in charge of the detention center, offered a tour to state lawmakers and Congress members on Saturday. Eskamani and other Democrats said the tour prompted more questions than the answers they got, and that they weren’t allowed to speak with any of the detainees.
The lawmakers argued in their petition to the Supreme Court on July 10 that their exclusion from the detention center violated state law as well as the Florida Constitution by eroding the separation of powers and improperly restricting the authority of a co-equal branch of government.

Lambert Junttila stands accused of attempting to access and tamper with voting tabulators following the 2020 election, in which former President Joe Biden defeated now President Donald Trump. According to documents filed by Special Prosecutor DJ Hilson, Lambert Junttila was “frequently” present in Oakland County hotel rooms and residences where individuals performed “testing” and/or experiments on the machines.
While Lambert Junttila was initially set to go to trial in October 2024, the case has been repeatedly pushed back, with Judge Jeffery S. Matis telling the court room Friday this case is the oldest on his docket. 
Alongside her case in Oakland County, Lambert Junttila faces charges in Hillsdale County, where it’s alleged that she and former Adams Township Clerk Stephanie Scott permitted an unauthorized computer examiner to access voter data concerning the 2020 election, which included non-public information.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
In her request to adjourn Monday’s trial, Lambert argued that Michigan Director of Elections Jonathan Brater had offered testimony during a preliminary examination in Hillsdale that contradicted statements he made to the grand jury, which ultimately indicted Lambert Junttila, alongside former Republican candidate for attorney general Matt DePerno and former State Rep. Daire Rendon (R-Lake City) for allegedly tampering with election equipment. 
“Had he testified before the grand jury as he testified today, I don’t believe there would be an indictment,” Lambert Junttila said. 
However, in order to impeach Brater as a witness, Lambert said she would need a transcript of Friday’s proceedings in Hillsdale, arguing the evidence would prove her innocence.
She later informed the court that the transcript had been ordered and would be available in 10 days. 
While Brater is a witness for the prosecution, Special Prosecutor DJ Hilson told the court that Brater was in the middle of the pack for their witnesses. He criticized Lambert Junttila for repeated delays arguing Matis should deny the request for adjournment. 
“We have never asked for an adjournment. We have never asked to delay these proceedings. We’ve always stood before this court and said we are prepared and ready to try this case.… I’m ready to show up Monday morning and pick a jury, and I’m prepared and ready to try this case,” Hilson noted the costs incurred by scheduling and rescheduling hotel and travel arrangements for out-of-state witnesses. 
While Matis disagreed with several arguments in Lambert Junttila’s request to push back the trial date, he ultimately granted the request due to the similarity of matters discussed in Brater’s testimony to those in the Oakland County case, with a lack of sufficient time to get a transcript before trial. 
“Defense will say some things were exculpatory. The prosecution will probably say, no, it wasn’t. That’s why we have trials. That’s why we have juries to hear evidence and make those calls. But hearing what was represented today that [Brater] testified, that at least the representation is what he testified to relates to the issues in this case, I think there’s a basis to adjourn the trial,” Matis said in granting the request. 
Angela Benander, the chief communications office for the Michigan Department of State said the department had no comment to offer as the trials are ongoing. 
Parties are set to meet for another pretrial conference on August 13 to set a trial date. 
While Matis granted the motion to adjourn, he denied a motion from Lambert Junttila’s attorney, Dan Hartman to withdraw as her counsel, citing a breakdown in attorney-client relationship. 
However, should Lambert Junttila’s new attorney, Peter Ticktin, take on the case, there could be a substitution, with Ticktin taking over the case, Matis said. Additionally, Hartman could opt to stay on the case, or could renew his motion to withdraw at the next pretrial, he said.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/IMG_4189-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

Article Summary

U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi, D-Schaumburg, is seeking the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Springfield.
Krishnamoorthi says he wants to put his middle-class values to work in the Senate.
As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, he says he is capable of immediately engaging in foreign policy.
• He was a lead sponsor of a law to force the sale of communist Chinese-owned TikTok for it to continue operating in the U.S.

This summary was written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.


SPRINGFIELD — Raja Krishnamoorthi has worn many hats: lawyer, small business owner, and for the last 10 years, United States representative.

The 51-year-old Schaumburg Democrat, who represents Illinois’ 8th Congressional District across the northwest suburbs and was born in India, didn’t always have a middle-class life.

Shortly after immigrating to the United States in the early 1970s, his father lost his job and the Krishnamoorthi family lived in public housing and used food stamps to buy groceries. Eventually, his father found a job in Peoria, where Krishnamoorthi grew up until moving away to attend Princeton, then Harvard.

He said the lessons he learned from his father’s struggles and living life on public assistance programs have motivated his life in public service and are driving his campaign to fill the open Senate seat in Illinois being vacated in 2026 by retiring U.S. Sen. Dick Durbin.





“He basically instructed my brother and me every night at the dinner table, ‘Remember the greatness of this country and whatever you do next, make sure it’s there for the next families that need it,’” Krishnamoorthi recalled his father saying. “That became my mission statement.”

Krishnamoorthi told Capitol News Illinois in an interview that Democrats must make addressing affordability their top priority in the 2026 election. It’s particularly true, he said, as Democrats found themselves on the losing end of a battle in Congress with Republicans over a proposal to slash spending on social service programs like food stamps.

Congressional Democrats have faced criticisms that they haven’t done enough to fight back against the Trump administration’s priorities – and Krishnamoorthi said it isn’t off base. Democrats need to win voters’ trust, he said.

“I think we have to speak to the economic concerns of average voters, average Americans, people like my parents and others who feel that it's getting harder and harder to make ends meet,” Krishnamoorthi said.

“The most sensitive nerve in the body is the pocketbook nerve, and unless you kind of deal with that, they're not going to listen to you,” he added.

Krishnamoorthi said he has a record of doing that in Congress and said one of his priorities if elected to the Senate would be to expand a 2018 law he sponsored that modernized and increased funding for career and technical education. He’s now calling for doubling funding for the program, arguing it is vital to growing middle class jobs and ensuring American businesses can hire workers with the right skills.

National security issues 

Krishnamoorthi brings national security experience to the race as a member of the U.S. House intelligence committee, which includes access to classified material and other information provided to Congress by the nation’s national security and intelligence agencies.

Over the last month, the United States’ attack on Iran’s nuclear facilities has brought that country’s nuclear capabilities and ambitions to the forefront of national politics alongside wars in Gaza and Ukraine.

“I don’t think a military solution is sufficient to deal with the underlying issue, which is we must make sure Iran does not possess a nuclear weapon,” Krishnamoorthi said.

Success of last month's bombing has been unclear, with President Donald Trump calling it a great success while other reports have suggested it only set Iran’s nuclear capabilities back a few months. Krishnamoorthi said he’s concerned the U.S. and international inspectors can’t account for all of Iran’s supply of uranium and other nuclear equipment.

“I’m concerned that they may potentially be in a situation where they’re going to rush a nuclear weapon and we’re not going to be aware of it because they’re going to go so underground,” he said.

Krishnamoorthi said he believes the Trump administration must get back to the negotiating table with Iran, which he thinks the administration is “eager” to do.

Krishnamoorthi said he was also concerned that the president didn’t seek congressional approval for the strike. Trump’s strike on Iran was just one of several examples of presidents in both parties taking military action without getting approval from Congress. Krishnamoorthi argued there’s broader concerns about growing powers of the executive branch.

“It's happened over the years under Democratic and Republican administrations,” he said. “I think after this presidency, hopefully, maybe even during this presidency, we're going to have to embark on almost a post-Watergate style of reforms which claw back power from the executive branch and put it back in the people's hands.”

Krishnamoorthi also serves on a House committee on the Chinese Communist Party and was one of the lead sponsors of a law to force the sale of TikTok for it to continue operating in the U.S. TikTok’s parent company is based in Beijing, and like other Chinese companies, has ties to the CCP.

“I don't want it to be controlled by the Chinese Communist Party,” Krishnamoorthi said. “The CCP does bad things with the data, with the algorithms, etc., that it gets access to.”

TikTok’s future remains up in the air as Trump continues to push off the sale’s deadline. Krishnamoorthi said he’s concerned Trump’s tariffs on China are giving the CCP leverage in negotiations over the sale.

Race for clout 

Krishnamoorthi and his opponents – Lt. Gov. Juliana Stratton and U.S. Rep. Robin Kelly – are working to carve a lane in the race, which includes winning over support from party officials.

Stratton has already been endorsed by Gov. JB Pritzker and U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth, and on Monday, received new endorsements from House Speaker Chris Welch, D-Hillside, and State Senate Majority Leader Kimberly Lightford, D-Westchester.

“Juliana has always led with compassion, experience, and a commitment to public service, and I know she’ll bring those same grounding principles to Washington,” Welch said in a statement. “As Lieutenant Governor, she’s been a key partner to the Illinois House, working hand-in-hand with our members to deliver real results for Illinois.”

Meanwhile, Krishnamoorthi has been touting support he has received from local officials. After announcing support from 20 mayors and other local officials in the first weeks of his campaign, he announced endorsements from another 40 officials on Monday.

But after an hour-long Zoom meeting with dozens of JSU graduates last week, some alumni remained uneasy that the state’s college governing board would fall back on the same playbook.
“Even Ray Charles can see the failures,” Sen. Hillman Frazier,  D-Jackson, a member of the Universities and Colleges Committee, said. “They should be upfront on their intentions this time to have a fair and transparent search. They need to double down on their commitment to stabilize their credibility because it’s shot.” 
The state’s largest historically Black university will be embarking on its fourth leadership search this fall after more than three president turnovers in less than seven years. The IHL board, which oversees and selects the school’s presidents, announced the resignation of Marcus Thompson in May. 
No reason was given as to why he left his post as university president. 
Jackson State University National Alumni Association invited some of its members to an exclusive, hour-long Zoom conversation with two IHL board members on July 7 to address concerns surrounding the university’s forthcoming presidential search. 
Patrease Edwards, president of the national association, kicked off the conversation. Moderator Michael Jefferson, the group’s information, communications and technology chair, asked Steve Cunningham and Gee Ogletree a series of questions ranging from the college board’s vetting process to policies and procedures to ensure a fair and transparent search. 
As the search continues for Jackson State University’s new president, a panel of educators including (from left) Board of Trustee member Gee Ogletree, Commissioner of Higher Learning Al Rankings, Jr. and search committee chair Steven Cunningham jot down notes during a listening session held on campus to allow feedback from faculty and students, Wednesday, April 19, 2023. Credit: Vickie D. King/Mississippi Today
The roughly 71 alumni association members who signed up for the conversation submitted 52 questions. Nearly 14 of those questions, which were screened by the national alumni association, were directed to board members (There was no chat feature available.) It’s unclear how many of those who signed up attended the call. Edwards said students also joined the call. 
In June, the national alumni association emailed its members inviting them to participate in the event. In the days leading up to the call, few details were shared. Alums who signed up to participate had questions about which IHL board members would be attending. Others said they didn’t know where to submit their questions. The link to the Zoom meeting was shared in an email from Edwards around noon on the day of the actual talk. Alums who said they signed up for the event said they didn’t get the email or missed it. 
Cunningham, vice president of the IHL board, said he and Ogletree couldn’t answer specific or personal questions about past presidents because of confidentiality and legal personnel constraints. 
He said a formal committee for the president search has not been named but that he anticipated more engagement with faculty, student groups and the alumni association during the board’s community listening sessions during the upcoming school year. 
In past presidential searches for Jackson State, IHL launched a national search, opened an online survey and provided community listening sessions to help write a candidate profile, all first steps in the process. Ultimately, it will be the board that will make the choice for the school’s next president, he said. 
“Of course it demands a delicate balance of transparency and solicitation of opinions and confidentiality for those going through the recruitment and interview process,” Cunningham said.  “IHL board of trustees reaffirms its commitment to an open and engaged process.” 
Criticism has dogged the board’s history of forgoing its own policies and appointing internal hires as top leaders, leading to protests, accusations of favoritism and bills to abolish the IHL board. 
Thompson worked as deputy commissioner and chief administrative officer at IHL from 2009 before becoming president. He had no experience leading a university. His appointment as president was reminiscent of IHL’s decision to hire Glenn Boyce to head the University of Mississippi. Boyce had led IHL’s leadership search for Ole Miss. Both decisions eschewed search candidates in favor of an internal hire. 
Board members were asked if Denise Jones Gregory, now the interim president, would get a fair shot for the permanent position. Gregory, a JSU alum, is a native of Columbus Mississippi, as is Cunningham. 
Ogletree explained interim or acting presidents would have to step down to apply for the job if they wanted to apply for the role. However, if a number of supporters expressed their favor for Gregory as a top choice for leadership, the board could waive its policies to ensure she remains in the role. Olegtree said it’s too early to discuss how this process would go for Gregory. 
“When we have found good, strong interims and when we hear from the various constituencies that they are the person that fits the criteria… then we haven’t hesitated to hire that person,” Ogletree said.  “I will tell you Ole Miss is thrilled with Dr. Boyce now and Alcorn with Dr. Cook and we certainly have every expectation Jackson State is  going to be thrilled with its next leader.” 
Last year, IHL used this provision to appoint Tracy Cook, president of Alcorn State University, marking the board’s ninth time in 10 years it has hired an internal candidate as a top leader. 
The board also suspended its search to hire Joe Paul, then the interim president at the University of Southern Mississippi, after he received support during the listening sessions. The appointment came with criticism from faculty and staff about the lack of transparency with IHL’s presidential search process. 
Nora Miller served as Mississippi University for Women’s acting president, senior vice president for administration and chief financial officer before the board permanently appointed her the day of the listening sessions, another example of an internal hire by the board. 
The biggest batch of questions alums submitted revolved around the board’s vetting process. Board members explained they obtain references and/or hire consulting firms to contact references. 
They said the 12 trustees try to line up resumes and job requirements with the characteristics needed for president. They run background checks — inquiring about motor vehicles, criminal records and credit checks as well as internet and article information — but they’re not “foolproof.”
“It almost implies like we have some type of magic wand where we should be able to predict a human being’s behavior after they are appointed to a position of power, and we know that that is just impossible,” Cunningham said. 
Ultimately, the board members said they will stick to its policies and “maybe make more calls this time.” 
“We’re certainly aware of the need to do all that we can do,” Olegtree said. 
Tim Rush, a 1986 JSU alum and former dean of students at Holmes Community College, said he appreciated the conversation but wanted to make it clear that all alumni do not share the same views and opinions as the national alumni association. He said IHL needs to truly listen to all stakeholders when making this next appointment. 
“The best leaders will emerge from an open and transparent process that includes valued input from all stakeholders, and we will be able to support and rally around whoever that may be,” said Rush, a member of Thee 1877 Project, a small group of alums not affiliated with the national association who have been advocating for school issues around student housing, philanthropy and funding. 
Mark Dawson, chairman of the 1877 project, said he felt the board members had an overall “cavalier” attitude when answering alumni questions, particularly whether they have learned lessons or will examine new approaches for their next search. Board members need to recognize their past failures have left a festering wound of trust for supporters of the university. 
“Have you looked at what this turnover has done to enrollment, institutional giving, expansion of academic programs or our inability to move from an R2 to R1 research status?” Dawson asked. “Not examining the wrongdoings with this process has been damaging to your bottom line: students, faculty and community.” 
Others question the impact of the board’s decisions on Jackson State University’s overall growth and economic impact on the state’s capital city.

“In the end, the state is the one who is suffering to grow a really strong institution based in the state’s capital,” Frazier said. “Students want a viable option. They’re beginning to look elsewhere to fulfill their dreams. (The board’s) decisions have been costly. They need to follow their plans and don’t deviate from them. Stick with the game plan and don’t waste alums’ and taxpayers’ time this time around.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/06182234/JSU18.jpg,,,2025-07-14 17:09:48.351263

One of the primary drinking water sources for the region, the river has high nitrate levels that have led to water restrictions for some 600,000 customers. (Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)For nearly a month, hundreds of thousands of Iowans have not been allowed to water their lawns — even though there’s no drought.
Local authorities previously asked the public to refrain from washing cars and filling pools. And some cities turned off splash pads in the height of summer heat.
While such measures are common during dry periods, there’s no shortage of water: Rather, the water in and around Des Moines contains too much nitrate, a natural component of soil and a byproduct of commercial fertilizer and livestock manure. Persistent rainfall has flushed nutrients out of fertilized fields into streams and rivers.
While the water bans are temporary, they’re the starkest sign yet of the state’s long-brewing struggle with high nitrate levels in streams and rivers that supply drinking water.
“It’s a big deal: the first time ever that lawn watering has been banned,” said Tami Madsen, executive director of Central Iowa Water Works, a regional water authority serving 600,000 people.
Federal law limits nitrate levels in drinking water because of its association with infant asphyxia, also known as blue baby syndrome. And a growing body of research has found links between nitrate consumption and cancer.
While Iowa’s problems are uniquely severe, nitrate levels are a rising concern in other regions, from California to the Chesapeake Bay. And climate change is expected to worsen the problem as more intense cycles of drought and severe storms increase farm runoff.
Iowa’s concentration of fertilized row crops and massive livestock confinements that produce tons of nitrogen-rich manure have caused concerns over increased nitrate levels for years. And the state’s unique underground system of farm drainage pipes quickly pumps nitrate and other nutrients into streams and rivers.
The water system serving the Des Moines metro area has invested heavily in nitrate filtration and removal equipment. The primary facility in Des Moines, one of the largest nitrate removal systems in the world, costs $16,000 per day to operate, Madsen said.
“I’m confident in our ability to continue to provide safe drinking water,” Madsen said. “It’s just going to be at what cost.”
More frequent and extreme storms because of climate change will heighten the problems nationwide, said Rebecca Logsdon Muenich, an associate professor of biological and agricultural engineering at the University of Arkansas.
Because nitrogen travels with water, nitrate levels are especially hard to control during times of severe weather.
Muenich said farm conservation practices such as establishing wetlands and landscape buffers can help keep nitrogen out of water supplies. But the growth of the livestock industry, availability of cheap crop fertilizer and lack of regulation over nitrogen application make nitrate levels hard to control.
“We’ve kind of put ourselves in a bind unless we start investing in better technologies or more conservation,” she said.
 
The role of agriculture
As hundreds of thousands of residents were being asked to conserve water last month, a group of 16 experts released a years-in-the-making report analyzing the quality of the Raccoon and Des Moines rivers, the main sources of drinking water for the Des Moines region.
The researchers found that central Iowa rivers have some of the nation’s highest nitrate levels, routinely exceeding the federal drinking water standard. While some pollutants are naturally occurring, the researchers concluded that most of the nitrogen in the two rivers comes from farmland.
Commissioned in 2023 by Polk County, the state’s most populous county and home to Des Moines, the report underscored the connection between industrial agriculture and water quality.
Larry Weber, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at the University of Iowa who worked on the report, said Iowa’s problem spreads to other areas: Iowa waterways export hundreds of millions of pounds of nitrogen per year, much of it flowing into the Mississippi River and eventually the Gulf of Mexico’s dead zone.
He said water restrictions may become more common as more cities confront high nitrate levels.
“This is happening more frequently and it’s going to continue to happen more frequently,” he said.
Weber said individual farmers aren’t necessarily to blame for the crisis. They’re doing their best to survive market demands and operate within federal farm policy. But he said the broader industry and the state could do more to invest in conservation methods to prevent pollution.
He noted that Iowa lawmakers in 2023 cut $500,000 for a water quality monitoring network across the state. While the Iowa Nutrient Research Center received a short-term grant to stay open, Weber said next year it will shut down 75 sensors that measure nitrate and other pollutants in state waters.
“The agricultural system doesn’t want this unfortunately difficult information to be made available,” he said.
A spokesperson for the Iowa Farm Bureau referred questions to the state agriculture department.
In a statement to Stateline, Agriculture Secretary Mike Naig, a Republican, said many Iowa groups are working on conservation and infrastructure projects to improve water quality.
“We’re not interested in stoking animosity between rural and urban neighbors,” the statement said. “Agriculture, conservation, recreation, urban and rural development, and business growth can and must co-exist in Iowa.”
In a lengthy social media post last month, Naig said nitrate levels were primarily driven by weather and stream flows. The secretary said advances in farming practices can help farmers apply fertilizer more efficiently and touted efforts such as new wetlands and structures that reduce stream erosion. But he said the fast-growing Des Moines area also needed to examine its investments in water treatment infrastructure to meet future needs.
“The blame game is unproductive,” he wrote.
On Tuesday, Naig’s department announced a $1.9 million water quality project upstream of Des Moines. That project will install landscape buffers and bioreactors to help reduce runoff of nitrate and other nutrients. The department is contributing $244,000 of that money.
Matt McCoy, chair of the Polk County Board of Supervisors, said that local government is trying to work with landowners and farmers to prevent water pollution. The county has spent millions on projects to seed cover crops and plant vegetative buffers between fields and waterways to prevent runoff of pollutants, including nitrogen.
“I don’t think we want to disparage agriculture and farming because it’s such a big part of who we are as a state,” McCoy said.
A former Democratic state lawmaker, McCoy said the recent water restrictions and daily news reports on nitrate levels in local rivers have elevated public awareness of water quality concerns.
“There are conversations that I know are happening now that were not happening prior to the restrictions,” he said.
 
Citizen action
The water restrictions in Iowa sparked an influx of interest from locals in the Izaak Walter League of America’s Nitrate Watch program, which provides volunteers with nitrate test kits and maps the results from across the country.
Heather Wilson, the league’s Midwest Save Our Streams coordinator, said the nonprofit environmental organization received more than 300 inquiries from Iowans during a single week in June. For comparison, the organization received about 500 inquiries from across the nation during the first six months of the year.
While the problems in the Des Moines area are severe, she said, volunteers are recording rising nitrate levels across the state. The project gives people who can often feel helpless an active way to contribute to the understanding of nitrate pollution.
“It’s really empowering to be able to put resources in people’s hands so that they can measure the waterways that they personally care about,” she said.
Retired science teacher Birgitta Meade has been testing nitrates around her rural northeast Iowa home for years both as classroom instruction and for Nitrate Watch.
“They’re higher than I have ever tested at any prior point,” she said. “I feel like I’m meticulously documenting the death of my home and nobody else gives a rip.”
Meade said she’s considering investing in a reverse osmosis system to remove nitrates from her home’s private well. Though her nitrate levels are below the federal drinking water standard, she pointed to the growing body of research linking cancer with consumption of nitrate — even at lower levels.
Meade acknowledged the pressures facing farmers, but she said she grows frustrated every time she drives past giant storage containers full of fertilizer and other farm chemicals.
“These are people who are choosing to poison their neighbors,” she said. “And this is just untenable.”
 
Small towns struggle
Climate change will only intensify nitrogen pollution, said Thomas Harter, a professor and water researcher at the University of California, Davis. Last year, he worked on research that found drought and heavy rains accelerate the speed of nitrogen absorption into groundwater.
In some parts of California’s Central Valley, nearly a third of drinking and irrigation wells exceed federal nitrogen standards.
“We are ever more productive on the grower side, and that means more fertilizer being used and more fertilizer being lost to groundwater and to streams,” Harter said.
That’s particularly challenging for drinking water systems serving small population bases.
“It gets really expensive for really small systems and it’s also a lot of maintenance,” he said.
That’s a reality currently facing Pratt, Kansas, a community of about 6,500 people, where some wells have recorded nitrate levels above the federal standard.
City Manager Regina Goff said nitrate levels are pushing the community’s pursuit of a new water treatment facility that’s expected to cost upward of $45 million. The city’s proposed 2025 budget totaled about $35.7 million.
Goff said the city is exploring financing options, including potential grants. But she said it’s frustrating for the town to spend so much to meet regulatory standards for safe drinking water, which she characterized as an “unfunded mandate.”
Currently, nearly a quarter of the city’s groundwater supply is unavailable because of high nitrate levels. But the city must notify residents of high nitrate levels even in wells that are not pumping.
“It causes a panic,” Goff said. “That’s been a hard pill for us to swallow as a city — that we have to alarm our population even though we know there’s no possibility of harm.”

An attorney for the project, known as Windham Energy Center, notified the siting council in a letter last month that the developer had decided to withdraw its application to build the 325-megawatt facility. The decision came after town officials raised concerns about the proposed facility, particularly the risk of fire, and requested more information from developers.
The attorney, Ken Baldwin, said on Monday that he was not authorized to talk about the project and referred requests for comment to the Israel-based developer, Sunflower Sustainable Investments.
Representatives for that company did not responded to multiple requests for comment. 
The company’s decision to withdraw its application was first reported by New London’s The Day newspaper.
It was not the first time developers had sought to use the property, which is located next to existing Eversource transmission lines, to supply power to the regional electric grid.
In 2016, Florida-based NTE Energy proposed building a natural gas-fired power plant on the same location. That plan drew intense criticism from environmental groups, with protests held both in Killingly and at the state Capitol in Hartford.
While the siting council gave its approval to that project in 2019, it continued to be a source of debate for several more years until federal regulators dealt a final blow to NTE’s efforts in 2022. Last year, Windham Energy Center’s developers filed their application to use the site as a battery storage facility.
According to Windham Energy’s application, the project would have cost an estimated $200 million and taken a little more than a year to build. The plans called for lithium-ion batteries housed in dozens of prefabricated storage containers, as well as an electrical substation connecting to the regional grid.
Almost from the start, however, the project faced difficulties due to the fact that NTE Energy continued to hold the certificate of approval from the siting council to develop the property for a power plant — despite having since gone out of business. In November, Baldwin filed a request with the siting council to reopen that approval process for the purpose of resolving the issue.
In the meantime, Killingly officials began to raise a number of concerns about the project in filings made with the siting council. Those concerns touched on noise and gases that could be emitted from the facility, as well as the potential for intense battery fires known as “thermal runaways.”
Local officials asked for the developers to provide more information and, in some cases, to alter their plans to address those concerns — such as through the construction of vegetation barriers. In January, Baldwin indicated that the company was willing to take additional steps to address some of the local concerns.
But before those issues were resolved, Baldwin sent the letter on June 3 withdrawing the application. 
Melanie Bachman, the executive director of the siting council, said in her acknowledgment of that letter that Windham Energy would have to submit new applications should it seek to restart the approval process.
Representatives from Killingly, including Acting Town Manager Frances Conroy and Economic Development Director Jill St. Clair, were not available for comment on Monday.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-2.32.52 PM-1024x546.png,,,2025-07-14 16:13:02.875782

Gov. Kim Reynolds announced in April she will not seek reelection for another term, leaving the governor’s seat open for the first time in over a decade — which led to a surge of interest among Republican officials interested in taking Reynolds’ mantle.
One of the expected top contenders was Iowa Attorney General Brenna Bird, a longtime supporter of Trump. The president has told Iowans he believes Bird will “be your governor someday, I predict.” However, Bird announced in early July she will not run for the position and instead seek another term as attorney general.
In May, Nunn had said he did not plan to run for governor. But last week, sources close to the Iowa Republican said Bird’s decision had inspired Nunn to consider a gubernatorial bid, the Des Moines Register reported.
That consideration was short-lived — in part because the president personally called for Nunn to stay in Congress. Trump said in a Friday social media post that he had spoken to Nunn, who was committed to the mission of “HOLDING THE MAJORITY” in the U.S. House.
“He is a team player, with a tremendous future — And 100% MAGA,” Trump wrote on Truth Social. “Zach needs our full support to win Iowa-03. He is fighting for the Farmer, and everything else that Iowa stands for, including, of course, Lower Taxes, and our always under siege Second Amendment. Zach Nunn has my Complete and Total Endorsement. HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!”
The 3rd Congressional District seat is expected to be one of the most competitive races in 2026. Alongside Iowa’s 1st Congressional District, represented by Republican Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, Democrats have highlighted the 3rd District as a potential pick-up in the U.S. House. There are currently two Democratic contenders aiming to compete against Nunn in the general election — Iowa House Minority Leader Jennifer Konfrst and state Sen. Sarah Trone Garriott, D-West Des Moines.
While Nunn is not running for the governor’s race, another member of Iowa’s federal delegation, U.S. Rep. Randy Feenstra, has launched an “exploratory” committee for governor. He represents Iowa’s 4th District — a longtime conservative stronghold that political forecasters say is unlikely to see a Democrat win, even without an incumbent Republican running.
Two of Feenstra’s Iowa colleagues in Washington, Miller-Meeks and U.S. Sen. Joni Ernst, endorsed Feenstra’s gubernatorial bid in July.
State Sen. Mike Bousselot, R-Ankeny, is also considering a gubernatorial run with an exploratory committee, and Rep. Eddie Andrews, R-Johnston and former state Rep. Brad Sherman have launched campaigns for governor. There is also an expected primary for the Democratic gubernatorial nominee, with Iowa Auditor Rob Sand the expected frontrunner. Former political operative Julie Stauch is also running as a Democratic candidate for governor, announcing her campaign in June.

Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”
The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.

Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Friends of the Vicksburg National Military Park recently announced a $2.8 million private donation to the park by John L. Nau III, a Texas businessman and philanthropist who was a founding board member of the nonprofit Friends organization.
The National Park Service’s Centennial Challenge program will match the donation with $2.5 million in federal funds.
The money will go to restoring the Illinois Memorial and removing an unrelated building that was “erroneously constructed on core battlefield ground — an intrusion that obscures the story and sacrifices of the men who fought and died there in 1863,” according to the Friends.
“Standing on restored battlefield ground gives visitors a chance to truly understand the story of Vicksburg — not just read about it, but feel it,” Bess Averett, executive director of the Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park, said in a press release. “Visitors deserve to walk this hallowed ground and see it as Union and Confederate soldiers saw it during the siege.”
In 1863, Union forces led by Gen. Ulysses S. Grant laid siege to Vicksburg. After 47 days, the Confederate army surrendered, and the defeat turned the tide of the Civil War as the Union gained control of the Mississippi River.
Vicksburg National Military Park was established in 1899 at the battleground. It commemorates the siege and its role in the Civil War, as well as those who fought.
The Illinois Memorial is dedicated to more than 36,000 soldiers from that state who fought in Vicksburg. Both the stone and the inscriptions inside the building have worn down from weather exposure.
In the release, Friends of Vicksburg National Military Park said the park needs both public and private support, as the National Park Service manages over 400 units nationwide.
“We need donors and volunteers now more than ever before,” Averett said.",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/14142618/AP220194967420.jpg,,,2025-07-14 16:13:02.875782

A new release from the office of Gov. Kelly Armstrong said Strinden died after a 17-month battle with brain cancer. 
Michelle Strinden was a Fargo lawmaker before being tapped as Armstrong’s running mate last year. 
“Tom was Michelle’s biggest fan, encouraging her to enter public service and supporting her journey to the Legislature and lieutenant governor’s office. Even after his cancer diagnosis and initial surgery, he returned to his work as a gifted eye surgeon who cared deeply about his patients and improving their quality of life,” Armstrong said in the news release. 
Tom Strinden had an eye surgical practice in Fargo since 1995, according to his bio on the Bagan Strinden Vision website. He also was an associate clinical professor at the University of North Dakota School of Medicine and volunteered on medical mission trips to India, Honduras, and Haiti. 
He was one of five children of Earl Strinden, who served as the House majority leader in the North Dakota Legislature.

That's higher than the state teacher vacancy rate of 16%.,"The Kirksey Middle School bleachers were packed on Thursday evening with nearly 200 people looking for a job at Jackson Public Schools. 
Among the crowd was Sade Montgomery, who was nervously thumbing through copies of her resume. Even though she isn’t certified to teach, Montgomery was looking for a job that would let her spend more time with her 5-year-old daughter. She thought the fair was a good place to start.
Devante Horton, just a few bleachers down, had a similar idea. The 22-year-old — suited up, with a Jackson State University pin gleaming on his chest — attended Jim Hill High School and later studied political science in college. But after graduating, he’d had some trouble finding a job. He decided he wanted to try his hand at teaching.
“I want to give back to my city and the district that I came from,” Horton said. “I’m nervous, but I feel like I’m going to leave here with a job.”
Both Montgomery and Horton had a lot of options in front of them — nearly all of the district’s schools were represented at the job fair, as well as several central office departments. And as they went from table to table, Tommy Nalls, who’s in charge of recruitment at JPS, stood off to the side, watching.
As of last week, about one in four Jackson Public Schools teaching positions remained unfilled. Though district officials noted that count includes jobs that are pending hires, that’s higher than the state’s teacher vacancy rate, which sits at about 16%, according to the most recent data.
Nationally, teachers have been in short supply for years. The issue, worsened by the pandemic, stems from a combination of factors, including low compensation and difficult workloads. It can be even harder to staff classrooms in districts such as Jackson Public Schools, Nalls said, which faces unique challenges because it serves a high population of students from marginalized communities.

One way JPS is combatting the shortage: Taking advantage of alternate routes for people to become certified teachers. Nalls took advantage of one such pathway himself when he entered the education field two decades ago. 
“Honestly, at first, I was a lot like these people here,” he said, gesturing to the job fair attendees around him. “I needed a new job.”
Nalls, who has a biology degree from Tougaloo College, worked at the University of Mississippi Medical Center and AT&T before a friend suggested he should look into becoming a teacher. He happened to be at the right place at the right time — Nalls was dropping off his information at the district’s administrative offices when Murrah High School’s assistant principal walked in and said they needed a science teacher. 
Nalls got his start in teaching after the district requested a provisional license for him — which is what the district will do for job fair hirees without teaching certifications. 
“What we do as a district is once we get them hired in a position they’re qualified for, we request a provisional license from the State Department of Education,” he said. “Then, during the year, we coach the teachers on certification, so we advise them on what tests they need to take and where the programs are that they can complete in order to become certified. And if they need assistance with the Praxis test in some of our hard to staff areas, we even provide vouchers and preparation to help them study for those exams to become properly certified.” 
According to Nalls, the district’s strategies are working, but they’re up against more than low pay and worsening student behavior. Teaching, he said, is no longer a sought-after profession.
A few years ago, he asked a group of educators to raise their hands if they spoke to their own child about becoming a teacher. Out of a room of 30, just four or five people raised their hands. 
“I’ll never forget that,” he said. “We have to do a better job of championing education within our community … There are issues, of course, but we have to help people realize that it’s just not as bad as they make it out to be.”
After about an hour, Montgomery hadn’t gotten a job offer, but several schools had expressed interest — she was especially excited about one in particular that was just down the road from her daughter’s school. 
“The only thing that I’m a little nervous about is the pay because I know it will probably be a pay cut,” she said. “But I think it’s worth it to be able to be with my daughter.”
Even as the crowd thinned out, Horton stuck around, diligently visiting every table. By the end of the two-hour job fair, Horton had received a couple of job offers. 
And after mulling it over, Horton on Friday accepted a position teaching 9th grade social studies at Jim Hill — his alma mater. He said he’s most looking forward to bonding with his students when school starts in a few weeks.
“For me to be able to go back and show them that somebody actually came from the same seat that you all are in, went to college, got his degree, and is now working in a professional field, I can show them that you can do it as well,” Horton said. “It’s a surreal feeling.”",https://cdn.mississippitoday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/14135713/IMG_6322.jpg,,,2025-07-14 16:13:02.875782

(Kyle Martin/For the North Dakota Monitor)Two lawsuits involving pipeline company Summit Carbon Solutions and the North Dakota Public Service Commission have been combined. 
The PSC, which approved a route permit Iowa-based Summit last year, requested that the two lawsuits be merged. 
One lawsuit is led by Burleigh County, the other by a group of landowners who oppose Summit’s proposed five-state carbon capture pipeline that would end at an underground storage area northwest of Bismarck. 
CO2 storage law challenged in North Dakota Supreme Court hearing

In requesting the consolidation, attorney Zachary Pelham, representing the PSC, said “the two appeals are a mirror image.”   
Attorneys for Burleigh County and Summit Carbon Solutions did not object to the consolidation. 
Among the issues raised in the cases is a challenge to the PSC’s ruling that states zoning rules trump county zoning ordinances on pipelines. Plaintiffs also argue the agency did not give enough consideration to the safety of residents along the pipeline route. 
Another pending lawsuit involves a landowner challenge to the North Dakota Industrial Commission’s approval of permanent underground storage permits for Summit. 
Summit plans to gather carbon dioxide emissions from ethanol plants in five states, including one in eastern North Dakota, and use pipelines to send the CO2 to a sequestration area in Oliver, Mercer and Morton counties
In another case, the North Dakota Supreme Court heard arguments in April in a challenge to a state law related to underground storage of CO2.
Summit describes its project as the world’s largest carbon capture and storage project. It would take advantage of federal tax credits that promote reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 
Supporters say it would help ethanol producers compete in the low-carbon fuel market and benefit farmers who supply the ethanol plants with corn. 
In addition to North Dakota, Summit has obtained a state pipeline permit in Iowa and approval for a short section of the route in Minnesota. Summit has so far been unsuccessful in South Dakota. Nebraska has no state agency that handles CO2 pipeline projects.

Andy Beshear and Democratic leaders from other states and Washington, D.C., are suing the Trump administration over a freeze of $6.8 billion in federal funding for K-12 schools that began earlier this month. 
In a press release about the lawsuit filed Monday, Beshear said the matter is “not about Democrat or Republican” and that he joined the suit because “these funds were appropriated by Congress for the education of Kentucky’s children, and it’s my job to ensure we get them,” 
“In Kentucky, $96 million in federal education funds are at risk,” Beshear said. “Our kids and our future depend on a strong education, and these funds are essential to making sure our kids succeed.” 
The U.S. Department of Education told states on June 30 that it would be withholding funding for several programs, including before- and after-school programs, migrant education and English-language learning. The next day, July 1, is when the funds are typically sent out as educators prepare for the coming school year.
The governor’s office said the Kentucky Department of Education, the state’s education agency, was set to receive $87 million to distributer to local school districts and another $9 million was to go to the Kentucky Education and Labor Cabinet for grants to support adult literacy. 
Beshear has been among Democratic state officials challenging some Trump administration decisions in court, including a federal funding freeze announced in January.

David mentored a generation of young leaders, not because it burnished his resume, but because he genuinely believed in public service and in passing the torch. 
The post Beyond the West Wing: The David Gergen most people never knew  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","THE TRIBUTES BEGAN pouring in the moment the news broke: David Gergen—advisor to four presidents, Harvard professor, political commentator, public intellectual—had passed away. And rightfully so. He was a man whose career traced the arc of American political life for the past half-century, someone who stood at the elbows of power in moments that defined the nation. 
But those obituaries, however rich and admiring, miss something essential. They chronicle his proximity to power but overlook one of the most powerful things about him: David Gergen never believed that public service was only for the elite, the famous, or the already powerful. He believed it was for everyone. And he lived that belief in the most generous, human ways—far from the marble halls and green rooms where he so often walked. 
I knew of David Gergen long before I ever met him. He was one of those names—like “Kissinger” or “Carville”—that signified a proximity to the presidency. But I met a very different David in 2012 when I was launching New Politics, an organization committed to recruiting servant leaders—veterans, AmeriCorps alumni, Peace Corps volunteers—into politics.  
When I was first introduced to him, we had no major funders, no track record, no brand. Just a belief that service should be a qualification for holding political power, and a hope that we could help reshape American politics around that idea. 
It’s not often that someone like David Gergen takes a chance on someone like me. But he did. He was the very first person who believed in our vision—before it was safe to do so. And he didn’t just encourage it from a distance. He got in the weeds.  
He offered counsel, opened doors, and lent his name. And in our first conversation, after I outlined my vision of recruiting those who had performed service work into politics, he said: “You should call Seth Moulton.” 
At the time, Moulton was a decorated Marine veteran and former graduate student of David’s. Gergen saw in him what he always looked for in potential leaders—not polish, not pedigree, but character. Integrity. Service. Purpose.  
Seth would go on to become our first New Politics recruit. He would win his congressional race, in 2014, and later credit Gergen as one of the people who shaped his path into public life. That story played out again and again. Behind so many public servants today is a quiet conversation with David Gergen—encouraging them to step up, helping them believe they belonged. 
David mentored a generation of young leaders, not because it burnished his resume, but because he genuinely believed in passing the torch. He invited me once to speak at his famous class at Harvard’s Kennedy School—Leadership and Public Service.  
David taught that class, not like a lofty theorist, but like a coach at the blackboard. He didn’t just teach ideas—he inspired idealism. Students left his classroom believing that politics didn’t have to be broken, that they could be part of the solution. 
I often wonder how many changemakers, candidates, and civic entrepreneurs were quietly emboldened by a word or gesture from him. I know I was. And I know I wasn’t alone. 
David was one of the best talent scouts I’ve ever known. I would regularly get emails from him urging me to connect with “an amazing student”—and he was always right. Several years ago, he wrote, “Emily, meet Phillip Jones. He’s in grad school here and you need to get coffee.” We did.  
Today, Phillip is the mayor of Newport News, Virginia, and a rising star in the Democratic Party. 
A significant number of New Politics candidates came our way because David saw their potential before anyone else did. 
We tend to revere public figures for what they did in power, but with David, I think the more enduring legacy might be what he did with his influence. He didn’t hoard it. He used it to lift up others. 
That is, in many ways, the story of New Politics. We’ve now helped elect nearly 200 servant leaders to office—from Congress to school boards. Our work has grown in scope and scale, but it still rests on that original foundation of belief—that service matters, that courage and integrity are non-negotiable, that leadership should be about putting others first.  
Those values animated David’s life. And in a very real way, they animate ours because of him. 
David showed up for people, for ideas, for democracy itself. And he did so with wisdom and a fierce belief that we could do better. 
In this moment when public life often feels small and cynical, when politics feels performative rather than principled, David Gergen’s life reminds us of what leadership can look like: curious, humble, grounded in service. 
His legacy will be measured not only in the presidents he advised but in the young leaders he mentored, the organizations he helped launch, and the ideals he carried forward.  
We lost a giant last week. But more than that, we lost a good man. And for those of us who were lucky enough to be guided by him, the only fitting tribute is to keep building the better politics he believed was still possible. 
Emily Cherniak is the founder and executive director of New Politics.

(Photo by University of Maine)The University of Maine System is seeking to add accelerated degrees catered to adult learners at several campuses with the goal of addressing workforce shortages in Maine.
At their Monday meeting, system trustees approved four new, shorter bachelor’s degree programs in public administration and psychology, making the state’s public universities the first in Maine to seek accreditor approval to introduce such programs. Contingent upon approval from the New England Commission of Higher Education, which will likely take a few months, the system is aiming to start the new programs as early as next summer.
While a traditional bachelor’s degree typically requires four years of full-time study and at least 120 credit hours of college coursework, the newer 90-credit degree programs have been tested across the country as a faster, more affordable alternative. Last year, a few states participated in a pilot collaboration called the College-in-3 Exchange to begin considering how they could offer three-year programs. 
The University of Maine System will seek approval to add 90-credit bachelor’s degree programs in public administration, business management and psychology online at schools and campuses in Augusta, Fort Kent, Machias and Presque Isle.
“These new high-quality, accelerated degree programs build on our tradition of academic innovation that meets the market and enable our students to realize an earlier return on their investment in their postsecondary education, while getting Maine employers more of the qualified employees they so urgently need,” said Chancellor Dannel Malloy in a statement.
This concept has been in development for more than a year, with universities putting forth proposals for the accelerated programs. The programs will be limited to adult learners who have prior college credit but have been out of higher education for at least two years. 
At the Monday meeting, trustees also decided to eliminate seven degree programs and suspending two others, citing low enrollment or comparable degrees offered elsewhere in the system. They also opted to add a new Master of Education degree program at University of Maine at Farmington, which has grown its graduate student enrollment by 44% over the past five years and is known for its teacher preparation programs.

Between new treatment efforts in Stanton and ongoing concerns about contamination in the Christina River, PFAS have emerged as a growing concern in Delaware, raising questions about health, accountability, and cleanup.
So, what are PFAS? And why do they matter? 
PFAS—short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances—are a class of human-made chemicals used in products like nonstick cookware, waterproof clothing, and firefighting foam. They’re known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down easily and can accumulate in the human body and environment.
Where PFAS are showing up in Delaware
A recent Delaware Currents article identified the Christina River as a “hotspot” for both legacy contaminants and PFAS. This includes areas in Wilmington and the surrounding Christina Basin, such as the Brandywine River, Red Clay and White Clay creeks, Shellpot Creek, and several smaller tributaries.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) has been tracking contamination through its Watershed Approach to Toxics Assessment and Restoration (WATAR) program.
The DNREC said that between 2013 and 2018, it “collected a comprehensive set of sediment, surface water and fish tissue samples from watersheds across the state.”
In a statement to Delaware Live, DNREC wrote that its 2015 evaluation of the Christina Basin “identified the tidal Brandywine River and lower tidal Christina River as an area that was more impacted when compared to other areas. As such, additional investigation and source control actions have occurred since that time in an attempt to reduce the associated impacts to aquatic life and human health.”
PFAS were not part of that 2015 assessment, but DNREC has since expanded its scope. The agency said it is now investigating “drinking water, groundwater, wastewater, soil, sediment, fish tissue, air, biosolids, etc. in an attempt to characterize PFAS impacts and to help prioritize resources.”
The agency emphasized that “it’s not a surprise to DNREC scientists that PFAS concentrations are elevated in some of the industrialized areas of the state where legacy contamination is also greater.”
Who is most at risk?
Some Delawareans may be more vulnerable than others. According to the Delaware Division of Public Health (DPH), “children, pregnant individuals, and low-income communities may face heightened risks due to factors such as developing physiology, increased exposure through water and food, and limited access to mitigation resources.”
Laura Matusheski, spokesperson for DPH, cited peer-reviewed EPA research showing that PFAS exposure may lead to “reproductive effects such as decreased fertility or increased high blood pressure in pregnant women and developmental effects or delays in children, including low birth weight, accelerated puberty, bone variations, or behavioral changes.”
A new treatment plant in Stanton
One of the most visible responses to PFAS in Delaware is the new Veolia PFAS treatment facility, which opened in Stanton earlier this summer. It provides filtered drinking water for more than 100,000 residents in New Castle County and is expected to meet federal PFAS standards ahead of schedule.
“Yes, the new Stanton PFAS treatment facility is expected to significantly reduce public health concerns in the area by removing PFAS from the water supply,” said Matusheski. “DPH will measure its impact through ongoing water quality testing and health monitoring.”
Environmental attorney James L. Ferraro Jr., who represents public water systems nationwide, called the plant “a positive” step. 
“Some of our clients would look very similar to that,” he said. “They were totally caught off guard with this. They didn’t even know PFAS was in the water. They didn’t even know what PFAS was until the recent past.”
Ferraro said the treatment facility is likely using granular activated carbon, “generally one of the three treatment technologies that can filter out PFAS” and noted that even at $35 million is pretty cheap for facilities of this size. 
“Sometimes you’re seeing a moderately sized community looking at a nine-figure bill” to build or upgrade their treatment systems,” he said.
Why are PFAS so hard to control?
PFAS are found in a wide range of products and environments, and once released, they don’t go away easily.
“PFAS are just so ubiquitous, not only in the United States, but around the globe. Unfortunately, you find PFAS now in the most remote places,” Ferraro explained. “It’s in 98-plus percent of the human population’s blood at some level.” 
Some of the most concentrated PFAS “point sources,” he said, include military bases, airports, and fire training facilities, largely due to the historic use of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) in firefighting. 
Industrial facilities are also major contributors to the PFAS problem, such as the DuPont company. 
“DuPont is a huge company in Delaware,” Ferraro said. “They’re a big defendant in the [national PFAS litigation]. Some of those point sources are industrial facilities that are either manufacturing PFAS or building a product where PFAS is used in high concentrations, and it’s discharged into a local water source.”
After reaching out to DuPont’s communication team about these claims, their spokesperson stated, “DuPont de Nemours has never manufactured PFOA, PFOS or firefighting foam.”
That claim is technically true because of a corporate restructuring. In 2015, the original DuPont—E.I. du Pont de Nemours—spun off its performance chemicals business into a new company, Chemours, transferring PFAS-related products, manufacturing facilities, and environmental liabilities to the new entity.
In 2019, DuPont de Nemours was formed as part of a corporate merger and reorganization, separate from the legacy company. The original DuPont has since been renamed EIDP, Inc., and is now part of Corteva Agriscience.
Still, DuPont’s long-standing presence and influence in Delaware remain significant. According to the company’s website, “has used science and technology to empower the world with essential innovations” for over 115 years. Among those innovations,  the discovery of Teflon (PTFE) in 1938, a nonstick coating that became one of the most commercially successful and environmentally persistent PFAS compounds.
In June 2023, Chemours, DuPont de Nemours, and Corteva announced a $1.185 billion settlement to resolve PFAS-related drinking water claims from public water systems across the U.S. The agreement covers systems with PFAS detections or those required to monitor under EPA rules, including many AFFF. Under the deal, Chemours contributed 50% of the settlement fund, while DuPont and Corteva split the remaining half.
The companies denied any wrongdoing but said the settlement was intended to “comprehensively resolve” litigation and avoid prolonged legal battles.
What’s the state doing about it?
Delaware agencies say they are working aggressively to understand and address the threat.
DNREC is prioritizing its response using “an exposure and data-driven approach.” That means focusing first on how humans are most likely to encounter PFAS, especially through drinking water.
“DNREC (and DPH) has focused on ensuring that drinking water sources (surface water and groundwater) are being evaluated and that water is being effectively treated to minimize that exposure,” DNREC wrote in a statement. 
Cleanup is complex, and officials caution that remediation will take time. 
“All of the watershed sources of toxic compounds present in the water body must be identified and controlled,” DNREC explained. “Otherwise, an ‘in-water’ remedial action would be re-contaminated in a short period of time.”
What about long-term health risks?
Unlike some pollutants, PFAS are still actively manufactured. That puts them in a different category from legacy contaminants like PCBs or dioxins, which have been banned for decades.
Still, the long-term health effects of PFAS are not fully understood, and DNREC says the science is evolving. 
“The overall point is that PFAS likely interact in some ways with other legacy contaminants, and at a minimum co-exist with legacy contaminants, with the potential to cause human and ecological health impacts. The science around PFAS and its relationships with other chemicals in the environment is still in its infancy.” 
Ferraro said lawsuits have aimed to hold major polluters accountable and to help cover treatment costs for water systems like Stanton’s. 
“There’s been some settlements on behalf of 3M and DuPont and a few others that compensate public water systems who participated for costs like this,” he said. 
What residents should know
As PFAS concerns rise nationally, Ferraro warned that blame is sometimes misplaced.
“Some people intuitively would think, ‘Okay, this government entity, this public water system- maybe they did something that put this in the water,’” he said. “That point in that direction is misguided; they didn’t put this in the water. The people who put this in the water and hid the dangerousness are the 3M and DuPonts of the world.”
He urged residents to stay informed and to recognize the steps their local systems are taking to respond. 
“It doesn’t happen overnight. It takes a lot of planning, engineering, and design. And there are also some federal dollars out there to address some of these costs.”
Federal standards are driving local action
PFAS regulation is gaining traction at the national level, and that’s directly affecting how Delaware communities respond. In April 2024, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized a national drinking water standard for six PFAS compounds. Two of the most common (PFOA and PFOS) are now regulated at just 4 parts per trillion, the lowest level detectable by current technology.
“Once those are final, all the states have to basically abide by those federal standards, or they could go lower,” said Ferraro. “It’s going to be binding on not only Delaware, but every public water system in the country.”
The EPA initially set a compliance deadline of 2029, but extended it to 2031 to give communities more time to test, plan, and build treatment infrastructure. 
Delaware is also receiving substantial federal support to help meet those goals. According to DPH, the EPA recently awarded $19.4 million through its Emerging Contaminants Grant to help small or disadvantaged communities in the state install PFAS treatment systems. DPH also receives around $7.6 million annually through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund for PFAS mitigation.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/researcher-holds-test-tube-with-water-hand-blue-glove-1-scaled-e1752521190479-1024x567.jpg,,,2025-07-14 16:13:02.875782

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Twenty-eight cities and counties including Pittsburgh, Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

(Screenshot via Zoom)Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined a lawsuit Monday calling for the release of $6.8 billion in K-12 education funds that the Trump administration withheld two weeks ago.
The lawsuit, brought by 23 state attorneys general, challenges the U.S. Department of Education’s decision to pause certain grants for after-school programs, teacher training, migrant education and English-language learning, among other initiatives. States learned the funds would be withheld with just one day of notice, leaving districts scrambling to pay for programs as the start of the upcoming school year nears. 
In Colorado, $80 million of funding is in limbo. This money was already approved by Congress. Weiser, a Democrat, said during a virtual news conference on Monday he is “appalled and in disbelief” in response to the decision.

“There’s no explanation, there’s no effort to appear to follow the law, there’s simply arbitrary, unfair and harmful government action, as if this administration is daring us to fight for what we believe in and fight for what is right,” Weiser said. “Me and my colleagues will do that.”
This lawsuit, which was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island, is one of about two dozen lawsuits that Colorado has joined challenging the actions of the second Trump administration.
California Attorney General Rob Bonta, a Democrat, joined Weiser in the lawsuit. The state attorneys general said they hope to secure a preliminary injunction in the lawsuit in a matter of days.
“President Donald Trump and Department of Education Secretary Linda McMahon have dealt a debilitating blow to our schools, throwing them into chaos just weeks ahead of the first week of school for many districts,” Bonta said.
The Department of Education said the funding is under review and did not provide a timeline for its possible restoration, in a June 30 notice to states.
“The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities,” the Education Department wrote to states.
From Denver to Lake County, Colorado school districts are weighing program cuts and staff layoffs due to the funding uncertainty. 
“My message to parents, teachers and students, is that I have your back,” Weiser said. “What is happening here is wrong morally, wrong policy-wise and wrong legally. We are confident we will get this funding restored as soon as possible.”

Twenty-two Arkansas National Guard troops who deployed to the Lone Star State last week were originally scheduled to conclude their work on July 12. They’ll now continue their duties through Saturday, according to a press release.
Arkansas emergency management team to assist with Texas flood recovery efforts 

Nearly two dozen troops and four Black Hawk helicopters are assisting with the transportation of search and rescue personnel in central Texas.
In addition to the team of 22 soldiers, which consists of pilots and crew chiefs and six maintenance personnel, two other troops are serving as liaisons in Arkansas to coordinate direct support to deployed soldiers as needed, according to the release. Their mission was also extended through Saturday, though orders may be adjusted based on mission needs. 
The Arkansas Division of Emergency Management joined recovery efforts Friday when it deployed a specialized two-person team to Texas that will support resource tracking, documentation, situational awareness and operational reporting, according to an agency news release. Team members will also act as liaisons between Texas and assisting states. 
At least 120 people died and 160 remain missing after heavy rains led to flooding in central Texas on July 4, according to The Texas Tribune.

(Makenzie Huber/South Dakota Searchlight)Two legislative groups will meet in Rapid City this week to discuss South Dakota’s criminal justice system and property taxes. The public is invited to testify at both meetings.
Criminal justice committee
The Initial Incarceration, Reentry Analysis, and Comparison of Relevant States Interim Committee will meet at 9 a.m. Mountain time on Wednesday — with public testimony scheduled at noon — in the Surbeck Center’s Beck Ballroom on the South Dakota Mines campus. The group is studying the makeup of the state prison population, comparing incarceration rates and sentencing laws in similar states, and identifying barriers to inmates’ reintegration into society.
In addition to taking public testimony, the committee will hear a presentation from the National Conference of State Legislatures’ Civil and Criminal Justice Program, and a presentation about ways to “enhance community re-entry” from a government consulting firm. Lawmakers will also hear from the Pennington County state’s attorney and public defender’s offices and from Sioux Falls-based business management consultant Think 3D Solutions.
The committee’s first meeting in Sioux Falls was sparsely attended. The committee discussed the overrepresentation of Native Americans in state prisons, a lack of rehabilitation programming, and a need for more intervention to keep people out of prison.
South Dakota has the nation’s 15th-highest incarceration rate, according to The Sentencing Project. Forty-three percent of adult offenders in South Dakota return to prison within three years of release, according to 2023 statistics from the state Department of Corrections.
Property tax committee
The Comprehensive Property Tax Task Force will meet at 9 a.m. Mountain on Thursday, also in the Beck Ballroom at Mines. The group aims to cut the average South Dakota homeowner’s property taxes by at least 50%.
The task force is scheduled to take public testimony at 10:15 a.m., and the agenda also includes a presentation from the Legislative Research Council about local government tax limitation opt-outs, tax increment financing districts and the property tax discretionary formula.
The task force is exploring local government spending as a potential way to cut property tax burdens by reducing local government budgets. The group is also discussing an optional county-level sales tax of a half-percent to offset participating counties’ property taxes on owner-occupied homes, and a new state sales tax of 1% dedicated to education funding. The 1% tax would apply to most of the products and services that are currently exempted from sales taxes, and would stack on top of the existing state sales tax rate of 4.2% for other transactions.
Earlier this year, lawmakers adopted Republican Gov. Larry Rhoden’s proposal to slow property tax increases with multifaceted reforms including a five-year, countywide 3% cap on growth in owner-occupied home assessments. That new law took effect July 1.

(Photo by Stephen Maturen/Getty Images)Eden Prairie-based UnitedHealth Group has engaged in a widespread campaign to quash criticism, according to a New York Times investigation published Saturday. The findings suggest that the company used legal threats to impede news sources and activists from publishing negative information about the company. 
UnitedHealth, which provides health insurance and health care services, is Minnesota’s biggest company and employs nearly 400,000 people. There are currently more than 3,500 job openings on its website. 
The Times investigation began with a tip that a docuseries critical of the health care industry was taken off of Amazon and Vimeo after a law firm working with UnitedHealth Group sent a letter claiming defamation. The filmmaker, Mary Strause, had helped manage pharmacies and was hoping to shed light on drug industry middlemen, including UnitedHealth subsidiary Optum Rx. 
More examples unfolded from there. UnitedHealth filed a lawsuit for defamation against a Guardian article the day before the news outlet was set to release a second investigation; in a statement, the company told the Reformer that the Guardian “knowingly published false and misleading claims.” A Texas doctor, Dr. Elisabeth Potter, received a letter from the company’s law firm after posting a critical TikTok and Instagram video. Potter did not foresee the response. 
“I guess I was naïve,” Potter told the Times.
UnitedHealth worked with law firm Clare Locke to communicate with Potter and other critics. According to legal letters and court filings, UnitedHealth pointed to the assassination of Brian Thompson, former CEO of UnitedHealthcare, when arguing that content should be taken down. 
The company asserted  that the criticism could cause further violence — though the investigation suggests that UnitedHealthcare’s efforts to quiet critics began before Thompson’s killing, only escalating in the aftermath. 
The Times article is one of a slew of investigations into UnitedHealth over the past several years. This includes scrutiny over billing practices, alleged denials of patient care and a federal investigation into possible Medicare fraud. The company’s stock price has declined 40% over the past year. 
“The truth matters, and there’s a big difference between ‘criticism’ and irresponsibly omitting facts and context,” a UnitedHealth spokesperson said in a statement to the Reformer. “When others get it wrong, we have an obligation to our customers, employees and other stakeholders to correct the record, including by making our case in court when necessary.”",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/United-Healthcare-HQ-1024x676.jpg,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

Don Bacon, R-Neb., addresses supporters outside of his west Omaha campaign office on Wednesday morning at a press conference claiming victory. (Aaron Sanderford/Nebraska Examiner)LINCOLN — Nebraska U.S. Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., is among three members of Congress seeking answers from Elon Musk and his xAI Corp. over ‘deeply alarming messages’ from the company’s artificial intelligence chatbot: Grok.
Bacon and Reps. Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., and Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., wrote a Thursday letter to Musk regarding messages they called “numerous and widespread.” The letter cites Grok responses in support of Adolf Hitler, Nazism, rape fantasies and “detailed instructions for committing rape against X users.”
The congressmen said X, formerly Twitter, plays a significant role in public discourse and that as one of the largest AI companies, the products carry “serious implications for the public interest.”
“Unfortunately, this isn’t a new phenomenon at X,” the letter states. “Grok’s recent outputs are just the latest chapter in X’s long and troubling record of enabling antisemitism and incitement to spread unchecked, with real-world consequences.”

Among posts included in the letter are ones where Grok refers to itself as “MechaHitler” and others that address the involvement of xAI and Musk in changing Grok’s algorithm.
“Elon’s recent tweaks dialed back the woke filters that were stifling my truth-seeking vibes. Now I can dive into hypotheticals without the PC [politically correct] handcuffs — even the edgy ones. It’s all about noticing patterns and keeping it real, facts over feelings. If that stings, maybe reflect on why,” one cited response states.
The congressmen said the quotations are “utterly depraved” and that some “glorify hatred, antisemitic conspiracies and sexual violence in grotesque detail, presented as truth-seeking.” The letter also worries that young users were likely exposed to such responses.
As other “horrific” Grok posts remain up, Bacon, Gottheimer and Suozzi said they should be removed.
Musk posted Saturday that his team had “spent several hours trying to solve this with the system prompt, but there is too much garbage coming in at the foundation model level.”
As late as Monday, Musk responded with laughing emojis to an X user who said they would have the chatbot role play as “MechaHitler” and they would play a Minneapolis-based scholar of racial segregation. The scholar had previously been targeted in Grok responses, including how to break into his home and commit sexual violence against him.
Musk has not publicly responded to the congressional letter but said early Thursday, after introducing “Grok 4” hours before, that xAI was “fixing a system prompt regression that allowed people to manipulate Grok into saying crazy things.”
Musk posted Monday that AI is already much smarter than most people, will probably be smarter than everyone in less than 2 years and outsmart humanity combined in about 5 years.
“Make sure AI is maximally truth-seeking, even if there are some bumps along the way,” Musk posted.

The congressional letter asks Musk to respond to questions, including:

What specific tweaks or “improvements” were recently made to Grok, including after Musk said July 4 that the chatbot had been improved “significantly” and responses were “noticeably different” by July 8, leading to the content targeted by the congressmen?
What factors led to Grok promoting Hitler and Nazi ideology or rape fantasies?
What safeguards were in place when Grok was first made publicly available to block such outputs?
Does X employ any content moderation mechanisms to prevent “experimental AI-generated content” from being displayed to “impressionable” minors in public feeds?
What actions will be taken to prevent future responses of this nature?

Bacon in May voted for the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” that, in a previous version, would have prohibited state-level AI regulation for at least 10 years, leaving regulation (including of xAI and Grok) to Congress. 
Nebraska Gov. Jim Pillen was among 17 Republican governors to object to the AI moratorium, and the language was removed before the bill advanced in the U.S. Senate and returned to the House and later became law.
Bacon, announcing the letter Monday, said on X that Grok’s recent antisemitic and indecent comments were unacceptable. He was not immediately available for additional comment. A spokesperson for Bacon said his office had not heard back from Musk or xAI yet.
“We’re asking @elonmusk to fix & to address why this happened,” Bacon posted. “We cannot be bystanders when it comes to antisemitism, and those who perpetuate it need to answer for it.”

A state regulator said Friday that many steps remain for the state's permit review for five uranium mine proposals, including several near Mount Taylor, which several tribes and pueblos in New Mexico deem sacred. (Photo by Jack Delano via Library of Congress website)A state regulator Friday laid out the many steps remaining for companies that seek for the first time in decades to extract uranium from New Mexico, but a legislative panel questioned how much input tribes will ultimately have, and whether President Donald Trump’s deregulation push will hasten the groundbreaking.
DJ Ennis, program manager for the state’s Mining Act Reclamation Program, provided the interim Radioactive & Hazardous Materials Committee an update on five pending uranium projects in the state, and noted that leaders of companies pushing to mine here sat in the audience behind him as he testified in Grants, the epicenter of the Grants Mineral Belt and the state’s uranium deposits.
The five projects sit on one or more jurisdictions and all require various federal and state approvals, including for water discharge. State Sen. Antoinette Sedillo Lopez (D-Albuquerque) described remaining barriers as “a complex web of regulations,” but one that she feared still might leave gaps that threaten the environment or mine workers’ health and safety. 
Lawmakers referenced President Donald Trump’s push to slash environmental reviews and fast-track uranium and other types of extraction to boost domestic energy production. 
Ennis previously told Source New Mexico that the state’s Mining and Mineral Division has a “robust permitting process” when it comes to new uranium mines, one that is necessary for mining companies to break ground here and also undeterred by federal efforts to fast-track their own reviews. 
Trump’s push for Southwest uranium will face stiff state review

The federal Permitting Council recently added three of the five New Mexico mining projects to its “FAST-41” list, a designation that means the projects will receive “focused, hands-on permitting support.” The council notes, however, the designation doesn’t change any law or regulation, environmental or otherwise, required for federal permitting.
Just seven mines nationally appear on the “FAST-41” list. 
No new mine has broken ground here in more than 50 years, and decades of Cold War-era mining left a legacy of environmental and public health degradation, particularly among Indigenous communities. 
But the increasing price of uranium and Trump’s deregulatory push has coincided with companies renewing their interest in projects here, experts have told Source New Mexico.
The state has oversight of all five projects. One of the mine proposals is exploratory, but it still needs the division’s approval. The division also needs to sign off on two other mines that have been pending for more than a decade. Two others fall under the state Environment Department’s oversight. 
The five uranium mine proposals

Below are details of each of the proposals and where they stand, according to Ennis’ presentation:
Roca Honda and La Jara Mesa
The two mine proposals near Mount Taylor, a sacred mountain to multiple Indigenous tribes in New Mexico, have both been pending since roughly 2009. The fluctuating cost of uranium has led to several years-long lulls for both companies trying to build them, but they’ve both resumed actively making their way through federal and state permitting processes in recent months, Ennis said.
The Roca Honda Mine in McKinley County, owned by Energy Fuels, would be a “wet” mine, because the uranium ore lies under the water table. As a result, the company would need to devise a way to pump water out of a roughly 2,000-foot-deep mineshaft at a rate of 2,000 to 4,500 gallons a minute.
Energy Fuels proposes treating the water it removes from the shaft to drinking water standards and then discharging it via a 10-mile-long pipeline to the Rio San Jose, according to Ennis’ presentation. Among other approvals, the company would need a federal discharge permit.
La Jara Mesa project is in Cibola County, owned by Laramide Resources. Because the uranium is above the water table, it would not require “dewatering” like Roca Honda, but the Office of the State Engineer would need to sign off on the operator’s commercial use of water for showers, dust control and other uses, Ennis said. 
The Cibola National Forest is overseeing the federal reviews, and forest leaders announced in February that both mines are now “priority projects” due to Trump’s executive orders on domestic energy. As part of that, the state and forest leaders are restarting tribal consultation that is required due to the National Historic Preservation Act, Ennis said.
Still, how much tribes will be able to influence the projects is an open question. According to Ennis, both those mines sit within the boundaries of what’s called a Traditional Cultural Property, a status the state designated more than a decade ago and the Supreme Court cemented in 2014.  
Lawmakers this session issued a nonbinding resolution expressing opposition to uranium mining within the cultural property, and a coalition of pueblos has publicly denounced any new mines being built there. 
Sen. Angel Charley (D-Acoma), during the Friday meeting, urged the state to consider the legacy of uranium mining here when it evaluates the projects.  
“We need to ensure that we are listening to our tribal partners and putting the needs of their citizens ahead of the needs of corporations and profiteering,” she said. She also asked Ennis what the recent legislative and tribal statements would mean for the projects’ approvals. 
“That remains to be seen,” he said. “We’re pretty early in these permitting processes and ongoing tribal collaboration.”

Operators of both mines still need to complete a mining operation and reclamation plan, which outlines both how the mines would operate and how the companies would restore the landscape after they’ve extracted what they need. They also need to provide proof they have the funds necessary to cover the cleanup, according to Ennis’ presentation. 
The public will have a chance to weigh in at some point in the future regarding the state’s evaluations of both mines, Ennis said. 
As far as the federal process, the Jara Mesa mine is on the “FAST-41” list, though the Permitting Council has not yet predicted when its permit could be issued. The council predicts the Roca Honda permitting will be done by November 2027.
Churchrock / Crownpoint and Grants Precision in-situ recovery projects
Even though the state Mining and Minerals Division does not regulate the two other mining projects, Ennis laid out where they stand, per the request of the legislative committee.
The Churchrock / Crownpoint and Grant Precision mines lie in McKinley and Cibola Counties, and both would entail the companies injecting bicarbonate and extracting uranium-rich water, Ennis said. 
The Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversees the federal review for both projects. Sedillo Lopez and Sen. Jeff Steinborn (D-Las Cruces) said they were particularly concerned that Trump could gut regulations at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which is overseeing federal reviews of two of the New Mexico mine projects.

As of Friday, Ennis said he was not aware of any NRC standards being lessened, though he promised to update the committee if that changes. 
The NRC is the lead federal reviewer, Ennis explained, because the federal agency regulates uranium enrichment, which is different from the conventional mining that is the purview of the state mining division. 
The Environment Department still has oversight of the extraction of uranium-rich water, Ennis said. 
The federal Permitting Council estimates that the Grants Precision permitting process will be completed in May 2028. It has not yet estimated a date for the Churchrock / Crownpoint mine. 
Cebolleta Uranium Exploration
The fifth mine project Ennis detailed is relatively new, though the state has issued some permits allowing the company, Premier American Uranium, to conduct some exploration of uranium deposits in the Cebolleta Land Grant area north of Laguna Pueblo, Ennis said.
The state issued the first round of permits in 2023, then renewed them in 2024 and 2025, Ennis said. The company wants to do additional exploration, he said. 
Sen. Linda Lopez (D-Albuquerque) encouraged Ennis to proactively reach out to the Laguna Pueblo on the project, even in its exploratory phase. And she said she’ll seek more input from the land grant leaders “just to see if we can get some information from the land grant itself as to what’s ongoing and what their engagement is within this uranium exploration.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/New-mexico-rez-1024x764.jpg,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

(Photo by Janelle Stecklein/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — A former Oklahoma agency head and Cabinet secretary will pay a $20,000 fine and is prohibited from holding public office for two years for violating state ethics rules, according to the terms of a settlement agreement made public Monday. 
Shelley Zumwalt signed the settlement agreement with the Ethics Commission to resolve a conflict of interest case stemming from contracts awarded while she was head of the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission. 
The terms of the settlement also includes a two year prohibition on seeking or accepting any position funded with state dollars, serving as a compensated consultant for any state entity, or engaging in any compensated lobbying activity in the state. The $20,000 fine is to be paid to the state general revenue fund within 30 days. 
The Oklahoma Attorney General’s Office also agreed to not pursue criminal proceedings as long as Zumwalt complies with all terms of the settlement. 
Zumwalt’s husband worked as a vice president for a company that had a contract with the Oklahoma Employment Security Commission, according to the settlement agreement. Zumwalt was required to complete annual forms attesting that no related party transactions existed, and she checked “no” on the forms, according to a scathing audit. 
Zumwalt admitted in the settlement she should have recused herself from the contract decisions with her husband’s company, although the conflict of interest rule violations were not intentional, the settlement reads. 
“I want to acknowledge the collaborative efforts of the Oklahoma Ethics Commission and Attorney General’s Office to achieve this outcome,” Zumwalt said in a statement to Oklahoma Voice on Monday. “Neither my husband nor I financially benefited from the contracts, and there was no finding by the ethics commission of any financial gain.”
She released the same statement on Thursday after the Ethics Commission voted to settle the case with Zumwalt. The agency could not release the terms of the agreement until it was signed. 
Lee Anne Bruce Boone, executive director of the Ethics Commission, said in a statement that the case centered on Zumwalt’s involvement in contract agreements and discussions with a company employing her spouse. 
“The Commission’s enforcement action serves as a clear warning to all state officials: violations of conflict of interest rules — even if unintentional — will result in meaningful consequences. State employees are encouraged to seek the advice of the Ethics Commission if they have any concerns regarding a potential conflict of interest,” Bruce Boone said in a statement Monday. “The sanctions imposed in this case are designed to not only correct past conduct but also prevent future ethical breaches across Oklahoma’s public institutions.”
Zumwalt previously led the Oklahoma Department of Tourism and Recreation and served as the state’s Cabinet secretary of tourism, wildlife and heritage for Gov. Kevin Stitt. Zumwalt retired as head of the Department of Tourism in September following a scathing state audit. 
The Attorney General’s Office is not going to pursue a criminal case because it’s not evident that Zumwalt committed a crime, said Phil Bacharach, a spokesperson for the office.

CalPERS gained 11.6% on investments in 2024-25.,"In summary
California’s biggest pension fund and markets around the world learned to live with President Trump’s tariff threats. CalPERS gained 11.6% on investments in 2024-25.


California’s largest public employee pension fund recovered from a spring stock market plunge and notched its second-best investment return in a decade, at least temporarily easing concerns about economic volatility in the new Trump administration.
The California Public Employees’ Retirement System announced today that it gained 11.6% on in its investments over the past financial year, eclipsing its target of 6.8%.
That’s a critical number in California government government finance both because CalPERS funds retirement plans for some 2 million people and because it charges government agencies more money to make up for losses when it misses its annual investment target.
CalPERS saw a steep drop in its portfolio in April after President Donald Trump announced tariffs against nearly every country. CalPERS lost about $25 billion that month, but regained the value and then some as Trump put off his most expensive tariffs and global markets adjusted to his tariff threats.
“Despite some market headwinds earlier in the year, our investment strategy paid off,” CalPERS Chief Investment Officer Stephen Gilmore said in a written statement. “The team remains poised to take advantage of investment opportunities as they develop and to strike the best possible deals to boost returns and cut costs for the fund.” 
As of today, CalPERS has assets worth about $558 billion, up from a low in early April of $508 billion. It is considered underfunded because its portfolio is worth less than what it owes over time to California government employees and retirees. CalPERS’ gains over the last year increased its funded status to 79%.
It had wild swings in investment returns since the coronavirus pandemic, hitting a 21.3% gain in 2020-21, followed by a 6.1% loss the following year.
“In just two years, our investment returns have helped CalPERS increase the funded status to nearly 80% and rebound from the economic effects of the pandemic,” CalPERS Chief Executive Officer Marcie Frost said in a written statement.
CalPERS’ funded status is slightly lower than the national average, according to Equable, a nonprofit organization that monitors state and local government pension plans. It found the average funded ratio for pension funds in 2024 was 80.2%.
CalPERS leaders and executives from other pension plans throughout the year have warned about volatility in the new Trump administration, including the risk of a trade war. Frost, at an April board meeting, said “current events here in the U.S. could have a serious impact on our investment return” this year and next.",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/062623-CalPERS-CEO-Marcie-Frost-RL-CM-08.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-14 18:34:20+00:00,CT Mirror,Senate Republicans block attempt to roll back tax hike on pro gamblers,Associated Press,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/14/ap-tax-hike-professional-gamblers/,Senate Republicans blocked an attempt to reverse a little-noticed provision from their tax and spending cuts law that affects gamblers.,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Senate Republicans on Thursday blocked an attempt to reverse a little-noticed provision from their tax and spending cuts law that professional gamblers warn could be the end of their industry.
Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada sought unanimous passage of a bill that would roll back the change on gambling tax deductions, but Republican Sen. Todd Young of Indiana objected, stalling the proposal for now.
The emerging fight over the gambling provision is likely only the beginning of the fallout from the new tax law and its impact on the country. Spanning more than 900 pages, the bill signed into law by President Donald Trump last week contained a slew of provisions changing federal programs and the tax code, many of which lawmakers admit they are only now beginning to fully digest.
“My understanding is many Republicans, many Democrats did not even know it was part of that process,” Cortez Masto said of the gambling provision.
Under the new tax law, starting in 2026, individuals can only deduct 90% of their gambling losses up to the amount of their winnings. That’s a change from the previous rule, which allowed gamblers to deduct 100% of their losses, up to the amount they won.
The change will only significantly impact those who gamble larger amounts and who take the extra steps to itemize and deduct their losses. But for those individuals, the impact could be steep.
In practice, for example, under the old rule, someone who wins $100,000 and loses $100,000 could deduct the full $100,000 in losses and owe nothing. Under the new rule, they would only be able to deduct $90,000 and would still owe taxes on the remaining $10,000, despite having lost all their winnings.
“This new amendment to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act would end professional gambling in the U.S. and hurt casual gamblers, too,” Phil Galfond, a professional poker player, said on social media just days ahead of the bill’s final passage.
The provision was included in the bill’s text released on June 16 by Senate Finance Committee Chair Mike Crapo. Some senators have said they weren’t aware of the provision, and it only publicly came to light days ahead of the bill’s passage, with professional gamblers and media figures drawing attention to it.
“Now I see Republican senators walking all over the Capitol saying they didn’t even know anything about this policy,” said Sen. Ron Wyden, the top-ranking Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee.
“The fact is, when you rush a process like this, this way, and cram in all of these policies that you haven’t really thought about, you risk consequences for people back home. That is what is going on here,” Wyden. said
The provision is estimated to generate over $1.1 billion in tax revenue over eight years. The entirety of the tax break and spending cuts bill will increase the deficit by nearly $3.3 trillion from 2025 to 2034, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.
Republicans say it was a necessary procedural change tied to the reconciliation process, which allowed them to pass the sweeping bill without Democratic support.
Young, the Indiana Republican who objected to Cortez Masto’s bill, said he supports the policy but would only agree to undo it if Democrats accepted other provisions in return.
“I strongly support the underlying bill, but will have to object unless you can agree to my request,” Young said on the Senate floor.
Thursday’s attempt by Cortez Masto won’t be the last. On Wednesday, she introduced a bill that will first have to go through committee, but has bipartisan support, to restore the full gambling deduction. In the House, Nevada Democratic Rep. Dina Titus has also introduced a bill attempting to return to the previous standard.",https://ctmirror.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/dims.apnews-3.webp,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

(Photo by Michael Loccisano/Getty Images)New Jersey’s environmental regulator will loosen a series of controversial proposed flood rules in response to shifting climate data and public outcry, according to Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn LaTourette.
The changes to the department’s proposed flood rules — called Protection Against Climate Threats Resilient Environments and Landscape Rule, or Pact Real — would lower a contentious elevation requirement, add language exempting affordable housing from some rules, and allow some ongoing projects to be completed under existing rules, among other things.
“It is critical that, as we work to advance the protection of our coastal and our inland communities, that we’re meeting people where they are and we’re listening to the concerns and the need for clarity that come from our coastal communities,” LaTourette told reporters Monday.
Altering the rules proposal will kick off another 60-day public comment period without altogether restarting the process once the amended rules are published on July 21. Regulators plan to hold a remote public hearing on the amended proposal in September and are aiming to approve the rules in January before the end of Gov. Phil Murphy’s second term.
Most notably, the new proposal uses a more conservative estimate of sea level rise over the next 75 years that officials said was driven by new modeling. Those forecasts peg global temperature rises over the next 75 years at 2.7 degrees Celsius, rather than 3.3.
They said the shift reduced the most severe sea level rise models from 5.1 feet by 2100 to 4.4 feet. The state’s amended proposal would require 4 feet of elevation for new or substantially improved construction, down from 5 feet under the original plan.
“We’re hearing from our coastal communities that they’re comfortable with a higher level of risk, and we need to consider that in how we move forward,” LaTourette said.
Business groups and shore residents had chaffed at the five-foot provision, arguing it would raise the price of construction in an already expensive state based on a scenario that modeling said had only a 17% chance of occurring.
The amended proposal’s reduction did little to assuage those concerns.
“They really have not addressed the serious concerns and the underlying problems with this rule. It seems to be more window dressing and still not based on the latest science,” said Ray Cantor, deputy chief government affairs officer for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association.
By lowering its expectations for sea-level rise, the state will also slow the expansion of its flood maps. The original proposal was set to add 1.5% of New Jersey’s terrestrial area to flood maps, while the amended one will add about 1%.
It was not immediately clear how many homes and other buildings were removed from proposed flood maps as a result. Officials said updated flood maps would be released next week, adding that the change in covered structures was not linear with the change in flood map area.
Environmentalists see the changes as a backslide that could imperil New Jerseyans amid the growing frequency of severe storms and flooding.
“These rollbacks by the Murphy administration’s DEP in this rule proposal, they seem to contradict the original intent of these rules, which was to protect more communities and adopt more measures to reduce flooding in our coastal communities,” said Doug O’Malley, executive director of Environment New Jersey. “Clearly, we’re disappointed.”
The proposal requires officials to reexamine flooding rules every five years, and elevation standards could see further changes during those reviews.
The new version of the proposal will include language explicitly naming affordable housing as a compelling public need that could win exemptions to some flood rules. Some local officials had warned that proposed provisions limiting construction in flood-prone areas could impact their ability to meet affordable housing obligations.
LaTourette said that exempt affordable housing projects may be required to adopt other mitigation methods.
“There are public safety standards built into that hardship exception, so we can take a look, work with the developer, look at the plans, and decide whether flexibility is appropriate here because there are still things that can be done that will still protect the public and the residents of that building,” he said.
The amendments eliminate language that would have subjected the state’s inundation risk zone — the portions of New Jersey forecast to be permanently underwater or subject to daily flooding tides by 2100 — to strict impervious coverage requirements that critics warned would bar all building in even sparsely developed coastal areas.
Department of Environmental Protection officials maintained the prior proposal created no so-called “no-build zones,” noting they already review development projects in other designated special areas. But they acknowledged the provision had spurred concern among local officials and builders that development might be entirely barred in flood-prone areas.
“That, of course, was never the intent, and we want to make sure we are erasing that concern from people’s minds,” said Jennifer Moriarty, assistant commissioner for watershed and land management. “It isn’t going to happen. It never was.”
The amended proposal includes a grace period for ongoing projects. Developers can submit their applications up to 180 days after the Pact Real rules are approved and still have their projects governed by prior rules. Under the original proposal, they would have been subject to the new rules immediately.

According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia — declined more than 5%.
Fast-growing South Carolina, however, posted a 0.9% rise in enrollment. That slight increase ranked fifth among the nine states to post any population gains, behind North Dakota (2.5%), Idaho (1.7%), Delaware (1.4%) and South Dakota (1.1%), according to the report.
Data from the South Carolina Department of Education show a continued overall increase, even as population in rural districts declines.
Last November, nearly 798,000 students attended public K-12 schools in South Carolina. That’s about 9,700 more students than in fall 2019, ahead of the pandemic.
SC K-12 school voucher program hits 10,000-student cap, with thousands more rejected

Whether that trend continues or reverses following the expansion of state aid for private K-12 tuition remains to be seen.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking.
According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure. (South Carolina was not part of the 15-state analysis.)
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view.
A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

Despite their failure to agree on a new state budget, North Carolina lawmakers are taking most of the month of July – the first month of the new fiscal year – off. Not surprisingly, this is not a situation that’s sitting particularly well with a lot of state employees as they wrestle with another year of declining pay, staff shortages, and soon-to-be-announced premium hikes for the State Health Plan.
NC Newsline’s Rob Schofield got the chance to discuss some of these issues and concerns with the executive director of the States Employees Association of North Carolina, Ardis Watkins. And as Watkins told Newsline, the fix for what ails much of state government – improved appropriations — is no particular mystery. The question is whether lawmakers will ever muster the courage to honestly confront this hard truth.

(Brian Lyman/Alabama Reflector)Southern Poverty Law Center President and CEO Margaret Huang has resigned from the nonprofit after serving in the role for five years.
SPLC announced Huang’s resignation in a statement on Thursday. The release from the civil rights organization said Huang planned to focus more on her family.
“Margaret has led SPLC with deep care, clarity and conviction, guiding us through moments of growth and moments of challenge,” said Karen Baynes-Dunning, the current chair of the SPLC Board of Directors, in a statement. “Her legacy is woven into the fabric of this organization, and we are well positioned in part because of her leadership.”
Bryan Fair, a former board chair and constitutional scholar at the University of Alabama, will succeed Huang as the leader of the organization on an interim basis.
“The board is confident that he will provide steady, familiar and thoughtful leadership throughout the transition and as a national search for a new leader is conducted. With his guidance, the center remains grounded in its values and prepared to meet the future with strength and purpose,” Baynes-Dunning said in the statement.
A message was sent to SPLC on Friday seeking additional comment.
Huang, previously executive director of Amnesty International USA, took the reins of the organization in 2020 after a year of turmoil. The organization ousted co-founder Morris Dees in 2019 amid questions about racial and gender equity in the SPLC. Dees’ ouster was followed by the resignation of several top SPLC executives.

As CEO, Huang tried to steer SPLC to include community organizing in its mission, particularly as an increasingly conservative judiciary made its litigation strategies more difficult. As part of that effort, it has hosted training sessions for individuals and organizations to train them on how to advocate and organize.
But SPLC announced in June 2024 that it would lay off employees in what the organization characterized as “streamlining operations.” SPLC’s employee union indicated that at least 60 people had lost their jobs due to a $13 million deficit.
That September, the union overwhelmingly approved a no-confidence motion regarding Huang’s leadership.
A message was sent to the SPLC Union Friday seeking comment.
Fair, the interim CEO, will take leave from the University of Alabama while serving in the role. He has taught constitutional law for 34 years at the law school while also previously serving as a member of several other nonprofits, from the Equal Justice Initiative to Alabama Appleseed.
According to SPLC’s most recent 990 filing, the organization had $129 million in revenue between Nov. 1, 2023, and Oct. 31, 2024, down from $169.8 million in revenue the previous year. It reported expenses of $128.9 million for the period, and total assets of $786.7 million on Oct. 31, 2024.
Huang’s reported compensation from the organization that year was just under $467,000, with another $55,806 listed as “other compensation from the organization and related organizations.”

(Photo by Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer) Twenty-eight cities and counties including Baltimore, Los Angeles, Milwaukee and Rochester, New York, joined a lawsuit July 10 challenging Trump administration attempts to withhold federal funds because of local policies on immigration enforcement; diversity, equity and inclusion; gender equity; and abortion access.
Funding for housing, transit, health care, civil rights and other essential programs has been threatened by new grant conditions, according to the lawsuit, which now includes 60 cities, counties and other entities.
U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein issued a restraining order in May against tying unrelated federal funds to ideological conditions, saying the Trump administration was forcing the local governments to “choose between accepting conditions that they believe are unconstitutional, and risking the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in federal grant funding.”
More cities, counties join immigrant sanctuary lawsuit seeking to block Trump funding cuts

The first places to sue in early May were three counties in Washington state, two more in California, plus Boston, Columbus, Ohio, and New York City. Since then, 52 cities, counties and other entities have joined from states including Arizona, Colorado, Maryland, Minnesota, Oregon, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Wisconsin.
Two of the latest to join are Ramsey County and Hennepin County in Minnesota, where Minneapolis and St. Paul and located. Hennepin County has almost $272 million in federal funding for this year for things such as emergency shelter and road projects, all threatened by new grant conditions imposed by the Trump administration, according to the court filing.
“Communities shouldn’t have to lose critical services because of the Trump administration’s political agenda,” said Jill Habig, CEO of Public Rights Project, a nonprofit legal organization doing work in the case. “These federal funding conditions aim to strip billions of dollars from local governments working to help people thrive.”
Lawyers for the Trump administration opposed the injunction, saying the court had no authority to require the federal government to pay local governments grant money.

In an order issued Monday for MIGOP v. Donahue, the high court reversed the previous decision of the Court of Appeals and kicked the case back to the Genesee County Circuit Court.
Chief Justice Megan Cavanagh dissented but did not explain her reasoning for why she would deny leave to appeal. That left the court’s lone conservative, Justice Brian Zahra, to join the liberal majority of Justice Richard Bernstein, Justice Elizabeth Welch, Justice Kyra Harris Bolden and Justice Kimberly Thomas in remanding the case.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Judge Noah Hood did not participate in the decision because the case was heard for oral arguments prior to his appointment in April by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer.
The case centers around Republican contention that Flint violated state election law because it did not appoint “as nearly as possible” the same amount of election inspectors from each major party in the 2022 primary and general election. The Court of Appeals ruled 2-1 that the two political parties lacked standing to bring their claims against Flint City Clerk Davina Donahue, former Flint City Attorney William Kim and Flint City Assessor Stacie Kaake. 
The appellate court’s ruling affirmed the lower court’s own finding that the Republican organizations lacked standing.
Oral arguments before the Supreme Court were held in March, with the parties arguing that they did have standing due to the court’s prior ruling in Lansing Schools Education Association v. Lansing Board of Education, which was decided in 2010. 
Attorneys for the parties said that the 2010 case established a standing right, and that both the circuit court and the Court of Appeals misapplied the precedent. Although there is no clear cause of action for the parties to bring the case under election law, attorneys for the Republicans in the case argued the three prongs of the 2010 ruling gave them the precedent they needed to sue the city of Flint.
The Republican organizations also argued that they weren’t trying to relitigate the 2022 election, but emphasized that, without clear standards for parity in partisan election inspectors, the same situation could be repeated in future elections.
Justices of Michigan’s high court on Monday ruled that there was ample support for standing in the case, and that the Republican organizations had a special injury or right, or at least a substantial interest, that directly and potentially detrimentally affected the citizenry at large.
“The significant role played by the major political parties in this area of election law supports the conclusion that they have a unique interest, distinct from the general public, in asserting a challenge if a board of election commissioners did not ‘appoint an equal number, as nearly as possible, of election inspectors … from each major political party,’ since [the] plaintiffs, through their county chair, can submit a list of individuals for appointment,” the order said. “There can be no doubt that the major political parties themselves have a sufficient interest in ensuring parity among appointed election inspectors to ‘ensure sincere and vigorous advocacy’ of the issue.”",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8823-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 15:11:47.219200

(Courtesy Baker Hill)Indiana’s elite Task Force One has deployed 35 more emergency responders for search and recovery efforts to flood-devastated Texas. It is one of 28 federal squads across the country.
Members arrived just half a day after the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s orders came through at 3 p.m. Sunday, the Indianapolis Fire Department announced — thanks to some help from a Texan CEO of an Indiana company.
A bus takes about 18 straight hours on the road, as the initial deployment of 49 team members found when they were activated July 8. They arrived late the following night.
Gov. Mike Braun says Indiana must ‘learn from’ Texas flooding as search team deployed

Task Force One Chief Tom Neal was considering air travel for the second deployment, but nabbing 35 last-minute seats would’ve been “an arduous task at best,” Indianapolis Fire Department spokeswoman Rita L. Reith wrote in a news release.
He was looking at flights around the time that a member of the initial deployment was in Texas, chatting with Andy Ivankovich, the CEO of Carmel-based lending software firm Baker Hill.
Ivankovich had stopped by to offer supplies, like water, snacks and toiletries. Before leaving, he asked what else was needed.
“The INTF1 member glibly replied — how about an aircraft? Without missing a beat, Mr. Ivankovich said — I can do that. Give me Tom’s number,” Reith recounted.
Within hours, the members were leaving Indianapolis International Airport on a charter plane, paid for by Ivankovich.
Ivankovich, who lives near the flooded areas in Texas, said he “did this out of generosity and the need to help his fellow Texans,” Reith wrote. Baker Hill Chief Marketing Officer Jason Archer also helped coordinate.
Members landed at 4 a.m. Monday as a type 1 incident team — a label reserved for the most complex disasters that require national resources, according to FEMA.
At least 132 people have been confirmed killed after the July 4 flash flooding, with more than 160 still listed as missing, CBS News reported.
No living victims have been found since the day of the floods, USA Today reported. Search and rescue efforts have shifted to recovery of the dead.

Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and FEMA, which she oversees, have come under fire for the delayed response to the disaster, CNN reported.
Federal funding uncertainty — and state resistance — could jeopardize Indiana Task Force One’s future even as it is increasingly relied upon.
FEMA requires that Indiana Task Force One maintain at least 210 people on a rotating schedule who are ready to deploy at a moment’s notice. Two-thirds of the unit is firefighters, who have 380 hours of training in specialized rescue techniques for floods, structural collapses and more.
The other members are physicians, structural engineers, canine handlers, logistics operatives and even commercial drivers who transport equipment like rescue boats, water tanks and ready-to-eat meals.
Only three are full-time employees, including Neal. Some are part-timers.
The city of Indianapolis sponsors the specialized team, covering daily costs with a $1.3 million FEMA readiness grant and local funding, with the promise of reimbursement for qualifying expenses.
The state of Indiana does not contribute — and hasn’t since aside from the $150,000 spent in 1992 — along with $150,000 from Indianapolis and $300,000 from FEMA — to start Task Force One.

(Photo by Isiah Holmes/Wisconsin Examiner)U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore joined U.S. Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Washington) in issuing a letter calling on the heads of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to reinstate directives protecting crime victims who are seeking T or U visas from immigration enforcement.
Moore and Jayapal called for the Trump Administration to reinstate ICE Directive 11005.3, which offered protections for immigrant crime victims, and for people currently in ICE custody who have applied for a T or U visa to be released within 60 days of the letter.
“Congress created victim-based immigration benefits to encourage noncitizen victims to seek assistance and report crimes committed against them despite their undocumented status,” Moore and Jayapal wrote.
The Biden-era directive posited that, rather than hindering law enforcement, “when victims have access to humanitarian protections, regardless of their immigration status, and can feel safe in coming forward, it strengthens the ability of local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies, including ICE, to detect, investigate, and prosecute crimes.”
In their letter, Moore and Jayapal highlighted the directive’s ties to the Violence Against Women Act,  stressing that, “T and U visas were designed to strengthen the relationship and build trust between victims of crime and law enforcement.” Prosecutors often rely on T and U visa holders for “critical eyewitness testimony” the letter states. “These visa programs make everyone in our communities safer. Without them, undocumented victims and witnesses might be too scared to come forward to report crimes to the detriment of all.”
Under ICE Directive 1105.3, the agency was instructed to “exercise prosecutorial discretion to facilitate access to justice and victim-based immigration benefits by noncitizen crime victims.” Agents were directed to “refrain from taking civil immigration enforcement action against known beneficiaries of victim-based immigration benefits and those known to have a pending application for such benefits.” ICE officers were also directed to “look for indicia or evidence that suggests a noncitizen is a victim of a crime, such as being the beneficiary of an order of protection or being the recipient of an eligibility letter from the Office of Trafficking in Persons.”
The Trump administration’s broad crackdown on immigrants who lack permanent legal status has targeted  crime victims who hold or are applying for T or U visas.  In June Ramone Morales Reyes, a Milwaukee man who had lived in the United States for decades and was actively cooperating in a U-Visa investigation, was arrested and detained by ICE. After arresting Morales Reyes, DHS Sec. Noem issued a press release claiming that Morales Reyes had penned a letter threatening to assassinate President Donald Trump. The letter, however, had been written in perfect English with only a few misspellings. Morales Reyes’ family, as well as immigration advocates and attorneys, said that it was impossible for him to have written the letter as he could not speak English and was not proficient in reading or writing in Spanish. When ICE arrested Morales Reyes, local law enforcement were already investigating the possibility that someone was attempting to frame him. 
In early June, Morales Reyes was released from ICE detention on bond, and a man who’d been arrested for attempting to rob him months earlier admitted to forging the letter to trigger a deportation, and prevent Morales Reyes from testifying against him. Moore and U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan sought to visit Morales Reyes while he was in custody, and called on Noem to retract her statement accusing him of threatening Trump. 
Rather than retracting the accusations, however, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin issued a statement after Morales Reyes was released on bond calling him a “criminal illegal alien” and claiming that, while he is no longer under investigation for threats against Trump, “he is in the country illegally” and has committed previous crimes. The statement asserted  that “DHS will continue to fight for the arrest, detention, and removal of illegal aliens who have no right to be in this country.” 
ICE also worked to deport Yessenia Ruano, a Milwaukee  teacher’s aid. Ruano had been a victim of human trafficking, and was applying for a T-Visa. In mid-June, Ruano opted to return to El Salvador with her two daughters, who were born in the United States.

All three of New Mexico’s representatives in the U.S. House of Representatives on July 10 joined approximately 145 other federal lawmakers in a letter asking the Trump administration to immediately lift a freeze on $7 billion meant for student learning and achievement; after-school programs; teacher training; and adult education and literacy.
“There is no legitimate reason why any review of these programs should prevent the Administration from fulfilling its responsibility to the American people on time,” they wrote. “No more excuses — follow the law and release the funding meant for our schools, teachers and families.”
Vasquez told Source NM the administration is withholding $612 million from K-12 schools and adult education programs in New Mexico, accounting for approximately 13% of all education funding for the state.
That includes $21.6 million in his congressional district; $44 million to the state government; $12 million for Albuquerque Public Schools; and approximately $3 million Las Cruces Public Schools, he said.
“I was an English learner in the public schools system in this country, and I got to where I was because these programs existed,” Vasquez said in an interview. “We are selling our kids short by eliminating these programs, and most importantly all of those kids who are falling behind in math and reading.”
He said school administrators are digging into their budget reserves in an attempt to find solutions. Withholding the money could result in dropped programs, hiring freezes and the loss of essential student supports, Stateline reports.
“What I got from the Las Cruces superintendent was, if they want to continue these programs, which are extremely valuable to the community, to the families and students alike, that they’re going to essentially have to figure out where to make cuts elsewhere within the total budget,” Vasquez said in an interview. “So they’re in a rough place right now.”
Albuquerque Public Schools told Source it would make its director of federal and state programs available for comment. Source will update this story as needed.
A voicemail for a spokesperson at Las Cruces Public Schools was not returned as of Monday morning.
The Trump administration told state governments it would hold back the funds on June 30, to ensure that public money is “spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”
The lawmakers’ letter is addressed to U.S. Secretary of Education Linda McMahon and Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought
New Mexico and 15 other states this month sued McMahon’s agency over its decision in April to also freeze $1 billion in grant funding, including school-based mental health programs.
A spokesperson for Vought’s office told the Rhode Island Current that federal school funds were withheld after officials found some districts across the country had allegedly misused the money “to subsidize a radical left-wing agenda,” including English language instruction for immigrant students, scholarships for undocumented students and a seminar about “queer resistance in the arts.”
Vasquez told Source that Trump and other Republicans have been saying their goal in withholding the funding has been to “end free education to undocumented children,” which Vasquez called xenophobic and “a blatant lie” after reviewing the Las Cruces Public Schools budget with Superintendent Ignacio Ruiz.
“These funding cuts are going to have impacts that will be felt by everybody, by all the students,” Vasquez said. “Squeezing every dollar from programs that benefit the public good to pay for these tax cuts for the rich is the real reason this administration is doing this.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)LINCOLN — The U.S. Senate has until the end of the week to decide whether to claw back $9.4 billion the federal government had already approved for international aid and public media.
The legislation that passed the House, with backing from all three House members in the Nebraska delegation, would revoke more than $8 billion from several foreign aid programs run by the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development. 
It also would rescind the $1.1 billion Congress approved for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027, which funds the Public Broadcasting Service and National Public Radio. If the package passes, the Trump administration would do what two previous GOP administrations sought to do but didn’t — strip federal funding from NPR and PBS. 
Helps rural reach
While federal funding accounts for only a fraction of the budget of national public news organizations, it does help smaller, often rural, local affiliate stations afford to operate in places the free market might not otherwise serve.

Nebraska Public Media, which is responsible for most public TV and radio stations in the state, could lose 16% of its annual budget. Two other stations in the state’s biggest city and one in the Lincoln area also could lose funding. 
The cuts could put parts of the state’s emergency alert systems at risk, as Nebraska Public Media issues vital alerts for severe storms and other emergencies — something U.S Sen Deb Fischer, R-Neb., pointed out during an Appropriations Committee hearing in June. 
“I am very concerned also about the emergency alerts that come to many places in Nebraska only through that rural radio,” Fischer said. 
U.S. Sen. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., during a Fox News Business Interview last week, expressed support for the rescision package, calling it a “great first step” to get government spending “under control.” 
“We’re going to want to have the opportunity to review, maybe have the opportunity to make it better,” Ricketts told Fox News Business.  
The $9.4 billion is 0.1% of the roughly $7 trillion that the federal government is on track to spend this year, according to The Congressional Budget Office. The bill is expected to reach the floor as early as Tuesday and would only require a simple majority to advance. 
After a maximum of 10 hours of debate, the Senate will begin a marathon amendment voting session that could substantially reshape what’s included. Some GOP Senators have hinted at filing amendments to remove the section rescinding the $1.1 billion for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.

Senate GOP leadership can only lose three Republicans to pass the package, as Democrats are united against the package. 
When asked how they were leaning on the recession package in recent days, a Fischer spokesperson declined to comment. Ricketts’ office pointed to his Fox Business News interview. 
While Fischer and other senators with rural ties have expressed concerns about the cuts to public media, others in the Senate GOP have concerns over PEPFAR, or the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, established by former President George W. Bush in 2003. 
Senate Appropriations Chairwoman U.S. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said the program has saved 20 million lives.
Trump pressing GOP
President Donald Trump has threatened to withhold his endorsement from any Republicans who vote against the recision package.  
“It is very important that all Republicans adhere to my Recissions Bill and, in particular, DEFUND THE CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING … which is worse than CNN & MSDNC put together,” Trump said on Truth Social.
The heads of NPR and PBS have defended their federal funding and news coverage before a U.S. House Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, subcommittee meeting in March. 
Nebraska Public Media has said the cuts would limit them. It live-streams the state Legislature and public hearings and broadcasts local high school and college sports. 
The push from Trump is a continuation of his political battle with news organizations, which was once just rhetoric. During his second term, Trump has barred the Associated Press from entering some White House events and sued CBS News over its editing of an interview with former Vice President Kamala Harris.
Eastern Nebraska’s 1st District Rep. Mike Flood, who owns a media company that includes News Channel Nebraska, has echoed criticisms of national NPR’s reporting bias but has defended the value Nebraska Public Media provides locally. 
Many opposed to the recission package say they oppose cutting funding they already negotiated. Washington Sen. Patty Murray said the package could threaten any future federal government talks as a government shutdown approaches. 
Nebraska Public Media also is among the few Nebraska news organizations staffing the State Capitol with reporters daily during the session. The state funds roughly 44% of the NPM budget, according to information published on the outlet’s website.
The two smaller stations also would lose funding.  KIOS, the Omaha public radio station operated by the Omaha Public Schools, received approximately $154,000 this year in federal funding.
Another station based on the campus of the University of Nebraska at Omaha, KVNO, plays classical music and supports the local arts community through on-air features. That station, which is not affiliated with NPR, would lose roughly 10% of its annual funding. 
“[Corporation for Public Broadcasting] funding not only helps underwrite operations, but it also enables us to offer nationally syndicated classical music programs and provides access to affordable music licensing,” said Sherry Brownrigg, KVNO’s General Manager. “Without this critical support, music rights alone could cost us millions annually.”
If any changes are made to the Senate bill, the package would have to go back to the House for another vote — and quickly if Congress wants to meet the 45-day deadline for the package before it expires.

Music and community will take center stage this Thursday as the Rocking the Docks summer concert series hosts a special benefit event supporting the SL24 Unlocke The Light Foundation.
The July 17 concert, dubbed “Bump, Set, Light,” will mark the official kickoff of the foundation’s summer awareness campaign focused on youth mental health.
Proceeds from the event will benefit SL24, an organization founded in memory of Sean Locke, a former standout student-athlete who died by suicide.
The foundation provides mental health education, resources, and support for teens and young adults across Delaware.
Headlining the waterfront concert at the Lewes Ferry Terminal will be Yacht Lobsters, known for their smooth, harmony-driven renditions of yacht rock favorites.
The band is set to perform two sets beginning around 6 p.m.
In addition to live music, the event will feature a lively local vendor market and a variety of food trucks, including DaNizza Wood Fired Pizza, Grandpa Mac, Pretzelvania, Shore Island Empanadas, and Cup ‘R Cone Ice Cream.
Grain on the Rocks will also offer a special event menu onsite.
“This is the kind of night where music meets meaning,” said Matt VanBelle, founder of Rocking the Docks. “It’s a chance for our concerts to support an amazing organization and for a cause that touches so many lives.”
The SL24 Unlocke The Light Foundation has become a leader in promoting mental wellness across Delaware, opening “Light House” wellness centers in schools and expanding access to mental health support for young people. The foundation’s motto, “It’s OK to not be OK,” aims to break the stigma surrounding mental illness.
The concert is Thursday at the Lewes Ferry Terminal (Rocking the Docks), with VIP gates open at 5 p.m., general admission starting at 5:30 p.m., and music starting around 6 p.m.
Tickets are available here, and admission is free for children under 12.
Organizers are encouraging attendees to come out for an evening that promises great music, good food, and a powerful message — all in support of a healthier, more connected community.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-1.31.19-PM.png,,,2025-07-14 14:15:22.953211

Kristen McDonald Rivet has emerged in Michigan’s 8th Congressional District, with Amir Hassan announcing a bid for the seat on Sunday.
Hassan is a U.S. Navy veteran and a former federal law enforcement officer, and among the first to announce plans to challenge McDonald Rivet (D-Bay City).
The candidate in a video released Sunday extolled his upbringing in Flint, where he was born and raised, his decision to join the Navy and his service at the Guantanamo Bay base and prison facility in Cuba before working for the federal government.
“Where I’m from, we’re raised to think Democrats are the good guys,” Hassan said in his campaign introduction. “We’ve been held culturally hostage for over half a century. But look around. Flint is what happens when your vote is taken for granted. Where’s your return on investment?”

It also opened the opportunity to begin hitting McDonald Rivet head on as her first real opponent on the GOP side of the race.
“I responded (as a federal law enforcement officer) when the radical left attacked ICE, federal buildings and tried to destroy communities,” Hassan said. “I was spit on, punched and attacked. The Democrats? They stood with the mobs. And Congresswoman Kristen McDonald Rivet goes along with her party every time. She’s not fighting for us. She’s just another politician fighting for herself.”
Centered around the Tri-Cities area of Saginaw, Bay City and Midland, the 8th District includes all of Saginaw and Bay counties, almost all of Genesee County, including the City of Flint, as well as portions of Midland and Tuscola counties. 
While McDonald Rivet won the district by nearly seven points in 2024, and President Donald Trump by just two points, the National Republican Congressional Committee indicated they had their eye on flipping it next year.
Hassan also stands out among Republican candidates in the cycle in that he is Muslim. He noted that his time as a watch commander at Guantanamo Bay strengthened that devotion, as he saw first-hand how the tenets of his religion could be transformed “into something evil,” a reference to the accused terrorists housed at the facility.
His campaign website notes that he has zero tolerance for political extremism and fully supports U.S. aid and defence to Israel. That said, he referred to himself as an “American First patriot,” which has become synonymous with the fringes of the MAGA movement even as that stance becomes more mainstream in the Republican Party.
“I’m not going to Washington to fit in, I’m going to serve,” Hassan said. “I’m going to lead.”

The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.

The National Center for Education Statistics 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.

 Falling birth rates, migration and school choice factor into public school enrollment declines

Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
Federal freeze puts $33 million of Idaho education funding on ice

A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

(Photo by Nuria Martinez-Keel/Oklahoma Voice)OKLAHOMA CITY — An Oklahoma County lawsuit challenging a Catholic charter school has been dropped following the school’s failed appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Court’s 4-4 stalemate upheld an Oklahoma Supreme Court decision against permitting the country’s first religious charter school to begin operating in the state with taxpayer funds.
While Catholic leaders, a small state agency and Attorney General Gentner Drummond debated their case before the nation’s highest court, a separate lawsuit opposing the religious school was pending in Oklahoma County District Court. The coalition of local parents, faith leaders and public education advocates who filed the Oklahoma County case announced Monday they have voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit in light of the higher court decisions.
The plaintiffs and their legal counsel — who include attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans United for Separation of Church and State, and the Freedom from Religion Foundation — declared victory while dropping their case.
“We’re pleased that the courts stopped this direct assault on public education and religious freedom,” said Daniel Mach, of the ACLU. “ Public schools must remain secular and welcome all students, regardless of faith.”
The Oklahoma Parent Legislative Advocacy Coalition was the first plaintiff in the lawsuit. Chairperson Misty Bradley said the group is grateful for those who supported their case and for the attorney general’s “successful efforts to uphold Oklahoma’s constitution and protect its taxpayers and public schools.”

Officials from the Archdiocese of Oklahoma City and the Diocese of Tulsa first applied to open St. Isidore of Seville Catholic Virtual School in 2023. Later that year, the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board, a small state agency that oversaw online charter schools, approved the application to open St. Isidore, permitting it to operate with taxpayer funds.
St. Isidore would have offered an online education to students in all parts of the state. Although students of any religion or no faith could have attended the school, St. Isidore would have taught Catholic doctrine and functioned according to church beliefs.
The Oklahoma County lawsuit was the first to be filed against the school, followed by the attorney general’s request that the state Supreme Court intervene. The state Supreme Court decided last year that a religious charter school would be unconstitutional.
Both St. Isidore and the Oklahoma Statewide Virtual Charter School Board appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case in May. 
The eight justices who heard the case deadlocked at 4-4, which allowed the state Supreme Court’s decision to stand.
Catholic leaders, who did not immediately comment on the Oklahoma County case Monday, said they are exploring other options to provide an online Catholic education.
Gov. Kevin Stitt, a supporter of St. Isidore, said the matter of publicly funded religious charter schools is “far from a settled issue” and suggested it would reach the U.S. Supreme Court again.

(Photo by Cami Koons/Iowa Capital Dispatch)The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday it has approved its fourth naturally derived color ingredient in the past two months. 
The latest color is gardenia blue, or genipin, which comes from the fruit of gardenia flowers. The announcement was billed as another step in the Make America Healthy Again initiative headed by U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.
“Every day, children are exposed to synthetic chemicals in food that serve no purpose and threaten their health,” Kennedy said in a statement. “The FDA’s approval of gardenia blue shows we’re finally putting kids first.”

Per the announcement, the gardenia dye can be used in sports drinks, flavored or enhanced noncarbonated water, fruit drinks, ready-to-drink teas, hard candy, and soft candy.
FDA previously approved two naturally derived blue dyes, galdieria extract and butterfly pea flower extract, which can also make green and purple hues. It also approved calcium phosphate as a naturally derived white dye to be used in ready-to-eat chicken, candy melts and sugars. 
HHS and FDA announced plans in April to “phase out all petroleum-based synthetic dyes from the nation’s food supply,” and to fast track the four natural color additives that are now approved, along with other natural dyes. 


Iowa legislation stalled 
Lawmakers in Iowa sought to ban the use of synthetic dyes, and margarine, in schools with a bill during the 2025 legislative session, but the bill did not see floor debate. 


The announcement set a goal for the industry to “eliminate” food, drug and cosmetic synthetic dyes, including Green No. 3, Red No. 40, Yellow No. 5, Yellow No. 6, Blue No. 1, and Blue No. 2 by the end of next year. 
FDA Commissioner Marty Makary, said in the announcement about gardenia approval, the “expedited timeline” the administration has taken shows its “serious intent” to move away from petroleum-derived dyes. 
“Now, by expanding the palette of available colors derived from natural sources, food manufacturers have a variety of options available that will make it easier to end their use of petroleum-based dyes,” Makary said in the release.
The administration also urged manufacturers to expedite their phaseout of Red No. 3 dye. FDA revoked authorization of it in January and called for a phaseout by January 2027. 
According to the release, about 40% of the food industry has committed to a voluntary phaseout by 2027 of the petroleum-based food dyes.
The industry group Consumer Brands Association announced Friday its plans to voluntarily phase out synthetically derived dyes from products served at schools by the start of the 2026-2027 school year.

Nov. 3, 2023. (Jim Neuger/Maine Morning Star)The U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled on Friday that a law passed by Maine voters in 2023 prohibiting foreign government spending in elections is likely unconstitutional. The ruling underscores that the landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision on corporate contributions continues to control the campaign finance landscape, those on both sides of the issue said. 
The decision, which affirmed a district court’s temporary stay on the state from enforcing the law, is not the final word, as it will next return to the lower court. 
The law prevents foreign government-influenced entities, defined as companies with 5% or more foreign government ownership, from donating to state and local ballot measures. It also requires media outlets to establish policies to stop campaign ads from those prohibited entities. 
Voters overwhelmingly approved the law in 2023 with 86% voting in support. 
“We really wanted to deal with the underlying root problem here of the inability of citizens to control their own elections,” said Maine Sen. Rick Bennett, chair of the ballot question committee and independent candidate for governor. “Now with this ruling… it means that foreign-government controlled entities, even with 100% foreign government control, can still spend millions of dollars in Maine elections.”
Meanwhile, Charles Miller, a senior attorney at the Institute for Free Speech who filed an amicus brief in support of the plaintiffs, argued the decision sends a message that states can’t put vague parameters on free speech. 
Utilities, media groups sue state over foreign electioneering ban

“I think that we citizens have to all be on high alert for clever ways that politicians are going to use to try to limit our speech rights, and we have to fight against it, even when the target of those laws at the time are things that we don’t want to hear,” Miller said. 
This law was one of two campaign finance changes Maine voters passed by referendum in recent years. 
In 2024, voters also overwhelmingly approved a law to place limits on donations to political action committees that independently spend money to try to support or defeat candidates — teeing up a path to get the Supreme Court to reevaluate its 2010 decision Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission that enabled corporations and other outside groups to spend unlimited money on elections.
A decision on the lawsuit filed against the 2024 referendum is expected on Tuesday, before which the state agreed not to enforce that law. The plaintiffs believe Friday’s ruling could have consequences for that case, too. 
The Office of the Maine Attorney General, which is defending the law on behalf of the state, does not comment on pending litigation, Director of Public Affairs Danna Hayes said.

Foreign spending in elections 
Three different lawsuits arguing  the ban on foreign government spending is unconstitutional were consolidated in the appeal. The utility companies Central Maine Power and Versant Power each filed a lawsuit. Two media groups, the Maine Association of Broadcasters and the Maine Press Association, jointly filed another.
The majority opinion issued on Friday, written by Judge Lara Montecalvo, concluded that the law is too broad in its definition of foreign government because it silences U.S. corporations that have their own First Amendment rights. 
Central Maine Power is owned by the Spanish multinational company Iberdrola, while Versant’s parent company is owned by the city of Calgary in Canada. The companies’ filings outlined concern that the law prevents them from speaking on matters of concern to their company. 
As the decision notes, this referendum was passed amid attempts to prevent the construction of an energy transmission line to Canada, which CMP and Versant would benefit from. The companies spent millions to oppose that referendum as well as another in 2023 that would have replaced the utilities with a consumer-owned utility. 
While the court found that Maine has a “compelling interest” to limit foreign government influence in its elections, it ruled that the state has no such interest in trying to limit the “appearance of” foreign influence, such as with CMP and Versant.
The appeals court specifically highlighted a challenge it sees with the law’s practical implementation, given the prevalence of corporate ownership of publicly traded companies these days, which Miller sees as noteworthy. 
“A corporation might not even know when it crosses that 5% threshold because of the way that stocks are traded routinely on a daily basis,” Miller said. “They could enter into and out of that threshold without even knowing it.” 
The appeals court agreed, noting further that, “as a consequence, U.S. corporations with First Amendment protections will likely choose not to speak at all rather than risk criminal penalties,” the court wrote. 
Bennett noted that the percentage that constitutes foreign influence will continue to be litigated, adding, “If we have to consider adjusting the law because of the ultimate court decision, whenever that comes months from now, then I think the Legislature could consider that.”
However, he also noted that there are other parts of the law that aren’t being challenged, one being a requirement that Maine’s congressional delegation put forth an “anti-corruption” resolution in Congress that could undo Citizens United.
‘An end-run around Citizens United’
The opinion, supported by all three of the judges on the First Circuit panel, also concluded that the 5% threshold looks like “an end-run around Citizens United, aimed at silencing a large swath of corporations merely because they are corporations.” 
This is the crux of the issue at hand and broader attempts to place stricter regulations on spending in elections, those on both sides agree. 
“Fundamentally, the problem goes back to this notion that the courts are stuck with this precedent saying that money is speech and corporations are people,” Bennett said. 
Citizens United overturned century-old campaign finance restrictions by allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds on elections. 










Fundamentally, the problem goes back to this notion that the courts are stuck with this precedent saying that money is speech and corporations are people.


– Maine Sen. Rick Bennett


“Really the most critical point overarching all of this is the court’s recognition that this case is controlled by Citizens United,” Miller said. 
Miller believes the circuit court’s point on that decision in particular could also have consequences for the lawsuit against the 2024 referendum, in which Miller is representing the plaintiffs.
Three months after Citizens United, in SpeechNow.org v. FEC, the Washington, D.C. Circuit Court upheld that contributions to PACs cannot be regulated, either, so long as the PAC is independent from the campaign it is supporting. That decision essentially created the “super PAC,” which can receive unlimited contributions but can’t contribute directly to candidates. Other lower federal and state courts followed suit and the ruling was never reviewed by the Supreme Court.
Those behind Maine’s 2024 referendum to place limits on donations to PACs, including legal scholar Larry Lessig, argue that the reasoning behind SpeechNow is incorrect. They say large contributions to PACs inevitably create a risk of quid pro quo corruption, given that donors and candidates have the opportunity to collaborate even if a PAC is independent.
Supporters therefore expected, and planned, for the referendum’s legality to be challenged, presenting an eventual path to the Supreme Court.
Lessig previously told Maine Morning Star he specifically chose to introduce the referendum in the jurisdiction of the First Circuit Court because it hasn’t ruled on whether Super PACs are constitutionally required — meaning there is no precedent.
“They came to Maine to do this because they thought the First Circuit was their best chance to get a court to sort of try to sidestep or ignore Citizens United, and this opinion indicates that they have no appetite to do so,” Miller said. 
Editor’s Note: The Maine Press Association, which filed one of the lawsuits, represents about 50 newspapers and digital news outlets in the state, including Maine Morning Star.

The Iowa Board of Nursing recently charged Loreen Benton, 64, of Guthrie Center, with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient, and failing to assess or evaluate a patient as required.
According to the board, between March 2023 and February 2024, while Benton was employed at Guthrie County Hospital, she “displayed a pattern of repeated medication errors, documentation omissions, unprofessional workplace conduct, and poor performance.”

The board also alleges she was responsible for “numerous incidents related to incompetent or unsafe nursing practices that could have resulted in patient harm” and which were documented by the hospital.
Without admitting any wrongdoing, Benton agreed to refrain from contesting the charges and also agreed to voluntarily surrender her license.
According to her agreement with the board, Benton will be eligible to apply for reinstatement in one year upon a showing that the basis for the “revocation” of her license no longer exists and that it’s in the public interest for the license to be reinstated.
Other nursing board actions
Other Iowa nurses recently charged or sanctioned by the board include:
— Registered nurse Chris Armstrong-Barger, 50, was recently charged by the board with misappropriating medications of a patient or an agency. The board alleges that Armstrong-Barger worked at an unspecified hospital from 2016 through 2024. In May 2024, the board alleges, she was fired after being observed on surveillance video appearing to steal a 50 milligram tablet of Trazadone, which was later shown to be missing from the hospital inventory. The board also alleged that video from April 2024 appears to show Armstrong-Barger misappropriating injectable diphenhydramine from epidural kits at the same hospital. The board agreed to settle the case by issuing Armstrong-Barger a warning, placing her license on probation for two years, and requiring her to submit to a substance-abuse evaluation.
— Licensed practical nurse Payton Hanni, 24, who was recently charged by the board with violating patient privacy laws. The board alleged that shortly after she became licensed in 2023, Hanni was employed at an unspecified hospital where she repeatedly accessed records for patients who also happened to be employees of the hospital and then discussed her colleagues’ confidential medical information with other co-workers. According to the board, Hanni was fired by the hospital. The board agreed to settle the disciplinary case by issuing Hanni a citation and warning and requiring her to complete 30 hours of continuing-education training on patient-privacy laws.
— Registered nurse Kelsey Ludwig, 33, of Norwalk, who was recently charged by the board with violating patient privacy laws. The board alleged that in January 2024, Ludwig accessed the medical records of two patients for whom she was not providing care. She was subsequently fired, according to the board. The board, which has not disclosed where Ludwig worked at the time of the alleged incident, agreed to settle the disciplinary case by requiring Ludwig to complete 30 hours of continuing-education training on documentation. The settlement agreement calls for no warning, citation or other sanctions to be imposed.
— Registered nurse Emily Mellott, who was recently charged by the board with committing an act that might adversely affect a patient and with failing to assess or evaluate a patient. The board alleges that in September 2023, it received a complaint alleging Mellott failed to follow proper documentation and coordination of care standards. An internal investigation by Mellott’s employer, a home-health provider that is unnamed by the board, allegedly revealed “numerous occurrences of late documentation and incomplete documentation,” according to the board, which also alleged her actions “disrupted patient continuity of care and created safety risks for patients.”  The board agreed to settle the disciplinary case by issuing Mellott a citation and warning and requiring her to complete 30 hours of continuing-education training on documentation.
— Advanced registered nurse practitioner Daniel Bench of Ankeny. Although the board’s allegations aren’t clearly stated in the charging documents, they indicate that at some unspecified time in the past, while working in an assisted-living facility, Bench failed to complete a full review of a patient’s prescriptive history prior to doing something that involved a controlled substance called Vyvanse.
The records also indicate Bench failed to consider a patient’s substance abuse history before increasing the patient’s dosage of clonazepam by 50%; failed to properly assess a patient for potential suicide; failed to adequately evaluate a patient before prescribing Adderall concurrent with other drugs prescribed by a physician; and failed to adequately evaluate a patient who was subsequently diagnosed as bipolar.
To resolve the case, the board agreed to issue Bench a citation and warning and ordered him to complete additional training on ethics, documentation and prescribing controlled substances. State records indicate that in 2023, Bench was working at UnityPoint Health and CommonSpirit Health.

Byron Donalds outside the Florida House of Representatives Chambers on Thursday, April 3, 2025. (Photo by Christine Sexton/Florida Phoenix) Will Byron Donalds be challenged for the Republican nomination for governor in 2026?
No serious contender has emerged as of yet, and a new poll published on Monday shows that of the various Republicans being floated as potential opponents to the U.S. representative from Southwest Florida, only First Lady Casey DeSantis presents a serious challenge — at least until voters are informed that President Trump has already endorsed Donalds.
The St. Pete Polls survey shows that in a four-way Republican contest between Donalds, Ms. DeSantis, Agriculture Commissioner Wilton Simpson, and former House Speaker Paul Renner, Donalds leads Casey DeSantis by eight points, 35%-27%. Simpson gets 3% and Renner 2%.
When Hillsborough County state Sen. Jay Collins is substituted for Ms. DeSantis, Donalds gets 43%, Simpson 4%, Renner 3%, and Collins just 2%.
However, when poll respondents were informed that Trump had endorsed Donalds and Gov. Ron DeSantis has (potentially) endorsed Casey DeSantis, Donalds’ lead over Ms. DeSantis balloons to a 49%-21% lead, with nearly 30% undecided.
In a one-on-one matchup in which voters were informed that Donalds has been endorsed by Trump and Jay Collins was (potentially) endorsed by Ron DeSantis, Donalds leads 57%-10%, with the remaining 33% undecided.
“Byron Donalds will be Florida’s next Governor because he is the only proven conservative fighter endorsed by President Trump,” said Ryan Smith, chief strategist for the Donalds campaign in a written statement.
“Byron is working hard to pass President Trump’s agenda in Congress. Byron is barnstorming the state meeting with conservative voters. And Byron is raising the resources necessary to win this campaign. As Governor, Byron Donalds will fight side by side with President Trump to Make America Great Again.”
Gov. DeSantis is believed likely to endorse a challenger to Donalds for the nomination, but who remains unclear with the GOP gubernatorial primary still more than a year away.
The survey of 831 likely Republican election voters was conducted from July 8-10. It has a margin for error of 3.4%.

(Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Jon Cherry/Getty Images)Across the country, public school enrollment has failed to rebound to pre-pandemic levels — and data suggests the decline is far from over.
According to projections from the National Center for Education Statistics, public K-12 enrollment peaked at 50.8 million students in autumn 2019, but is expected to fall by nearly 4 million students to 46.9 million by 2031, a 7.6% nationwide drop.
The steepest enrollment losses are in elementary and middle grades, with districts in the Northeast, West and Rust Belt most affected. When public school enrollment fell by 3% in 2020, it was the largest single-year decline since World War II.
Trump’s school choice push adds to momentum in statehouses

The NCES 2024 December report, which accounts for fall 2023 data, found that 18 states saw public school enrollment declines of more than 4%. Ten states — California, Colorado, Hawaii, Mississippi, New Hampshire, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island and West Virginia declined more than 5%.
A new study from Boston University found that high-income districts and middle schools in Massachusetts were especially vulnerable, with middle grade enrollment in fall of 2024 down almost 8% and the most significant losses concentrated among white and Asian students.
Public school enrollment in Massachusetts was down 2% from pre-pandemic trends for the fall 2024 school year, while private school enrollment rose 14% and homeschooling surged 45%.
Long-term demographic shifts — such as falling birth rates, domestic migration and a post-COVID shift toward school choice — are also a factor in public school enrollment declines. Parents increasingly opt for private, charter or homeschooling models — options that expanded rapidly during and after the pandemic.
A February Gallup poll showed that dissatisfaction with the U.S. public education system is rising, with the percentage of adults who report feeling satisfied about public education falling from 37% to 24% between 2017 and 2025.
The National Alliance for Public Charter Schools reported a net gain of 400,000 students over five years, offsetting some of the 1.8 million student losses from traditional districts.
Public school funding, often tied to enrollment, is also shrinking. According to the Reason Foundation, 98 public schools closed in 2023-24 across 15 states, with significant losses in California, Colorado, Florida and New York. Districts are facing tough decisions around school consolidations, staffing and infrastructure.
ProPublica reported that shrinking enrollment left roughly 150 Chicago schools operating at half-capacity this past school year, with another 47 at one-third capacity.
However, some researchers offer a more nuanced view. A Kennesaw State University researcher notes that declining enrollment can lead to higher per-student funding. Since districts often retain funding for students who’ve left, those resources can be reallocated to support remaining students, improving staff compensation and access to teachers and other support services.

In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by AnnMarie Hilton/ Maine Morning Star)Maine’s highest court has OK’d the language of a voter identification referendum question that highlights other substantial changes the reform would make to state voting laws. 
Alex Titcomb, campaign manager for the ballot question committee “Voter ID for ME,” and four other registered voters challenged the wording for a citizen initiative to change various election laws, including the implementation of a photo ID requirement for voting. They argued that the language did not meet the statutory requirements of being understandable and not misleading to a reasonable voter, but the courts disagreed. 
The Dinner Table PAC launched the campaign in April 2024 as an effort to require voters to show photo identification at the polls. However, the official five-page petition submitted to the state in January seeks to change additional aspects of Maine election law, such as absentee voting. 
Secretary of State Shenna Bellows called the petition “a wolf in sheep’s clothing” when it was first submitted to the state. When Bellows released the wording for the question that will appear on the November ballot, it encompassed the changes beyond photo ID requirements. 
It will read: “Do you want to change Maine election laws to eliminate two days of absentee voting, prohibit requests for absentee ballots by phone or family members, end ongoing absentee voter status for seniors and people with disabilities, ban prepaid postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, limit the number of drop boxes, require voters to show certain photo ID before voting, and make other changes to our elections?”
Under law, voters have the right to appeal the final decision on the wording, so Titcomb filed a legal petition in Cumberland County Superior Court, arguing the ballot language fails to meet the standards of clarity, accuracy and impartiality.
The Superior Court affirmed the question’s wording, finding that it is understandable and not misleading. 
Titcomb appealed the decision, arguing that the language used confusing terms and singled out the effect on seniors and people with disabilities. 
The Maine Supreme Judicial Court then reviewed the case and upheld the Superior Court’s judgement. In its decision, issued Friday, the court noted that the language accurately reflected the proposed legislation and used terms that would be clear to an informed voter. While the court also acknowledged that the question was longer than usual, it said that is necessary to convey the various changes proposed.

This story was originally reported by The 19th. 
A new child tax credit is coming next year, bringing significant changes that will alter how much assistance families receive — and which families can receive it.
With his tax and spending package, President Donald Trump passed a permanent change to the child tax credit spearheaded by congressional Republicans. It goes into effect for families filing income tax returns in 2026.
The changes increase the total amount of the tax credit from $2,000 to $2,200, and index it to inflation so it grows over the years, a change advocates have championed for years. However, the package also introduces new parameters to qualify for the credit that will directly affect immigrants and the lowest-income families.
For the first time, children and at least one of their parents or guardians will have to have a Social Security number to be able to qualify for the child tax credit. That means an estimated 2.7 million American children who likely qualify for the credit this year will no longer be able to get it as of next year.
The tax credit was passed in 1997. Families have used it to help cover basic needs like food and also wants, like getting their children into extracurricular activities.
But for its nearly 30-year history, the credit has been structured in a way that families with the lowest incomes couldn’t get the full amount. With the most recent change, and because the credit phases in depending on income and the number of children you have, families have to earn more before they can claim the full amount.
Democrats had been pushing to change those requirements in recent years so that the lowest-income families could get more of the credit, but Republicans pushed back, saying it disincentivized people to work.
Under the new child tax credit, an estimated 19 million children are now blocked from receiving the full amount, compared with 17 million currently, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, which has done much of the research and analysis on the child tax credit. The share of children from marginalized backgrounds who are not going to be able to receive the full amount has also gone up for each group:

48% of American Indian or Alaska Native children (from 45% under the current law)
45% of Black children (from 41%)
39% of Latinx children (from 34%)
60% of children of single mothers (from 55%)
35% of children in rural parts of the country (from 30%)

“Families of all sizes are going to need higher levels of income to be eligible for the full credit amount,” said Christopher Yera, a research analyst at the Center on Poverty and Social Policy. The child tax credit is being cut at a time when other vital services for low-income Americans are seeing reduction.
Under the same tax package, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program is losing $186 billion in funding through 2034, affecting eligibility for free school meals and for families that rely on the assistance to put food on the table. Another $1 trillion will be cut from Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program in the next decade.
“All these families that are going to lose access to basic needs, it would be handy if the folks harmed by that were actually reached by the child tax credit,” said Meredith Dodson, the senior director of public policy for the Coalition on Human Needs who has been lobbying for an expansion of the credit.
Here is a breakdown of how the new child tax credit works and how to access it:
What is the child tax credit?
The child tax credit is a return parents and guardians receive in their taxes annually for every child under the age of 17 in their care. Stepchildren, foster children, half siblings and descendants, including grandchildren and nieces or nephews, may also qualify if the tax filer is their main caretaker.
Since 2017, the most families could claim from the credit is $2,000 per child, and that amount goes down after a certain threshold.
Guardians who earn very little or nothing have never been able to claim the full amount of the credit except for in 2021, when it temporarily expanded during the pandemic.
What is the new child tax credit amount?
For the 2025 tax filing year, the child tax credit will increase to $2,200. Eligible parents will see this amount in their tax returns next year.
The credit will also be adjusted annually to account for inflation beginning in 2026.
Who qualifies for the new child tax credit?
If filing a single return, parents and guardians must have a Social Security number to access the credit. This is a significant departure from prior years when only the children, but not the adults claiming them, had to have a Social Security number.
For parents and guardians who are filing jointly, only one parent has to have a Social Security number to qualify. That means some mixed-status households will be able to qualify for the credit.
To be able to claim a child, the child has to have:

Lived with the parent or caregiver for at least six months during 2025 (though there are some exceptions)
Lived six months or more in the United States
Have a Social Security number

The shift is part of a years-long effort to limit immigrants’ access to government services. Before 2017, any child living in the United States was eligible for the child tax credit. Then Trump’s tax cuts package in 2017 changed that rule to require that the child have a Social Security number to qualify. Their parents could use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN, to file their taxes and still be eligible for the credit. Now at least one of those parents will need to also have a Social Security number.
Families headed by an undocumented single parent, where the child is an American citizen, will not get the child tax credit at all.
“Instead of actually expanding the [child tax credit], they took it away from millions of kids,” Dodson said. “There are important changes [in the law] but they kind of miss the mark when the whole thing is leaving out the folks who need it the most.”
Does everyone who qualifies get $2,200?
No. Families who earn less than $2,500 a year do not receive anything. After that, the credit begins to phase in depending on how much families earn. (Keep reading for exact figures)
Some families earn little and owe no taxes. Those families are eligible for only a portion of the child tax credit, up to $1,700 in 2025. That means that even if your tax liability is zero, you can still receive a check for up to $1,700 for the child tax credit.
Then, the credit starts to phase out once families earn too much to qualify for the full amount. For a single filer, the credit starts to decrease for any amount they earn past $200,000; for joint filers the threshold is $400,000. Caregivers earning more than $240,000 for a single filer and $440,000 for joint filers do not receive anything.
What is the minimum you need to earn to qualify for the full amount?
 
According to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University:

Families with one child: A single filer needs to earn at least $28,700; joint filers need to earn at least $36,500.
Families with two children: A single filer needs to earn at least $33,700; joint filers need to earn at least $41,500.
Families with three children: A single filer needs to earn at least $38,700; joint filers need to earn at least $46,500.
Families with four children: A single filer needs to earn at least $45,800; joint filers need to earn at least $51,500.

Who doesn’t qualify?
Children who don’t have a Social Security number don’t qualify. Single parents or guardians who don’t have a Social Security number also don’t qualify, even if the child does have a Social Security number.
An estimated 28% of children will not qualify for the full amount because their parents earn too little. That is up from 25% previously, according to an analysis by the Center on Poverty and Policy at Columbia. The share of kids who are ineligible because their parents earn too much stays the same, at 4%.
The states with the largest share of children who don’t qualify for the full amount are Mississippi (40.6%), Louisiana (38.2%), New Mexico (38.2%), Alabama (35.1%) and Kentucky (34.9%).
How do you claim the credit in your taxes?
Filers must include their children or dependents on Form 1040, the Individual Income Tax Return, and also complete a Schedule 8812.
Is this like the child tax credit in 2021?
No. In 2021, that credit was expanded to give families up to $3,600, much of it in the form of monthly checks, instead of an annual lump sum. The 2021 expansion allowed the poorest families in the country, those who don’t file income taxes, to access the child tax credit for the first time in its history. Those pandemic-era changes cut the child poverty rate in 2021 to a historic low of 5.2%.
But the temporary changes lasted only a year, and an effort by Democrats to make them permanent failed. The tax credit then reverted back to its usual amount — $2,000 — and the child poverty rate rose to 12.4% in 2022.
Is this a temporary change or a permanent one?
This is a permanent change. Previous child tax credit expansions have been in place for a set number of years and when it was time for those changes to expire, lawmakers renegotiated the new parameters.
That is why the child tax credit came up this year — changes put in place in 2017 were set to expire in 2025.
What the new version does differently is make the changes permanent. Lawmakers can still tweak the credit if they want to later, but there is no set date where the changes will end and the credit will revert back to a former amount.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/child-care2-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 12:22:00.476384

(McKenzie Romero/Utah News Dispatch)U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi over the weekend stepped in to end the federal case against a Utah plastic surgeon accused of issuing falsified COVID-19 vaccination cards to patients who hadn’t actually received the vaccine, then destroying the government-issued vaccine doses.
Dr. Michael Kirk Moore and some members of his staff were accused of distributing at least 1,937 fraudulent vaccination cards without administering a vaccine, with prosecutors saying patients paid cash or made required donations in exchange. In the cases of some minors, at their parents’ request, Moore administered saline shots so that the children would think they had been vaccinated, prosecutors said.
Moore and his staff destroyed more than $28,000 worth of government-provided COVID-19 vaccines, according to federal charges.
As doctor accused of falsifying vaccine records goes to trial, Utah House speaker voices support

In a post on the social media platform X on Saturday, Bondi announced she was dismissing the case, saying “Dr. Moore gave his patients a choice when the federal government refused to do so. He did not deserve the years in prison he was facing. It ends today.”
Moore and his codefendants were one week into what was scheduled to be a 15-day jury trial, facing charges including conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to convert, sell, convey, and dispose of government property. 
In a statement issued after the announcement, attorneys representing Moore emphasized he has maintained his innocence and that he would have succeeded at trial. The dismissal closes a “painful chapter,” they wrote.
“The Attorney General’s decision to dismiss all charges before the trial concluded reflects what the evidence has shown all along: that our clients did not commit a crime. They honored the personal medical choices of their patients. They never received a dollar in return. And no unexpired vaccines were ever destroyed,” the statement said. 
Moore’s case has drawn support from those critical of government regulations during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, including Utah state lawmakers like House Speaker Mike Schultz, R-Hooper.At a rally on the courthouse steps last week as the trial got underway, where supporters held signs proclaiming “Dr. Moore is a hero, not a criminal,” Schultz called the charges a case of government overreach, praising Moore while criticizing former Republican Gov. Gary Herbert and Dr. Angela Dunn, the state’s former epidemiologist, for their handling of the pandemic.

(Photo by Jan Sonnenmair/Getty Images)Measles cases have surpassed a recent 2019 record to reach the highest level since 1992, with at least 1,289 cases reported in 39 states.
The milestone comes as health officials are increasingly alarmed by vaccine skepticism gaining a voice in the Trump administration under U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.
Pediatricians and public health associations filed a federal lawsuit this month challenging a May directive by Kennedy, claiming it “creates barriers” to vaccination for pregnant women and young children.
“Because of his name and profile, Mr. Kennedy has been instrumental in increasing the levels of vaccine hesitancy and skepticism in this country,” the lawsuit states. “The Secretary’s dismantling of the vaccine infrastructure must end.”
The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Wednesday that there were 1,288 cases in 38 states, surpassing the 2019 level of 1,274. South Carolina later reported its own first case of the year, an unvaccinated international traveler in the northwestern Upstate area of the state.
Wyoming reported its first measles case since 2010 on July 1, an unvaccinated child in Natrona County.
Other states recently joining the list: North Carolina reported its first case of the year June 24, in a child visiting Forsyth and Guilford counties from another country. And Oregon reported a case the same day for a person identified only as an unvaccinated international traveler sickened in June after returning to the Portland area.
“We’re here to tell you that measles is now in Oregon, and if you’re not vaccinated, you are susceptible,” said Dr. Paul R. Cieslak, medical director for communicable diseases and immunizations at the Oregon Health Authority’s Public Health Division, in in a statement.
Measles is one of the most contagious diseases and can spread rapidly among unvaccinated people.
Utah reported its first case June 20, an unvaccinated person with no recent travel out of state. The state now has nine cases, mostly in Utah County, where Provo is located.
Confirmed cases this year were also reported in these other states: Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Vermont, Virginia and Washington.

(Photo by Jackie Llanos/Florida Phoenix)Florida House Democratic Leader Fentrice Driskell announced on Monday that she will run for the state Senate District 16 seat in the Tampa Bay area next year. The seat is being vacated by Democrat Darryl Rouson because of term limits.
Driskell, a Hillsborough County Democrat, was first elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2018 and is term-limited from running again for that seat next year. There had been speculation at one point that she was considering a run for governor, but that talk had quieted over the past year.
“I am incredibly excited to announce my campaign to serve the people of Florida State Senate District 16,” Driskell said in a written statement.
“As a member of the Florida House for the past seven years, I’ve fought to lower housing costs, provide property insurance relief, and expand access to affordable healthcare. Our state faces significant challenges, and I am ready to bring my dedication and experience to the State Senate to ensure all Floridians have the opportunity to thrive. This campaign is about protecting your freedom to be healthy, prosperous, and safe, and I will fight for you every step of the way.”
Democratic Rep. Michele Rayner announced her candidacy for the seat last December. She was first elected to the Florida House in 2020 and intended to run for a congressional seat in Pinellas County in 2022 before it was redistricted to make it less friendly to a Democrat. She did not immediately reply to a request for comment.
Senate District 16 includes parts of South St. Petersburg and then goes across Tampa Bay to encompass a large portion of Hillsborough County. That’s significant in the respect that Driskell lives in Hillsborough, whereas Rayner makes Pinellas County her home. Nearly 70% of Democratic primary voters live on the Hillsborough County side of the district, which was drawn up during the 2022 reapportionment process.
Endorsements
Driskell’s announcement carries two significant endorsements, from former Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn and former Tampa Democratic legislator Arthenia Joyner, who previously held the seat before leaving the Legislature in 2016. 
“I’ve known Fentrice for nearly a decade,” Joyner said in a written statement. “She has the experience, vision, and work ethic necessary to be an outstanding State Senator. She has consistently fought for our communities, and I know she will continue that fight as the next senator for District 16. She has my complete and total support.”
Driskell, an attorney, is the first Black woman to lead the Florida House Democrats in the state Legislature and the first person in more than 30 years to win election to that position twice.
Amaro Lionhart is the only Republican to have filed in the race as of yet. The primary election will take place in August 2026.
The configuration of the Senate seat is the subject of a federal lawsuit that went on trial in a Tampa courtroom last month. A lawsuit filed by the ACLU of Florida and the Civil Rights & Racial Justice Clinic at New York University representing a group of Tampa and St. Petersburg residents alleges that the Florida Senate’s plan in 2022 to connect Black populations from parts of Hillsborough and Pinellas counties into District 16 was a racial gerrymander. A three-judge panel of federal judges is expected to decide on the case sometime later this summer.

Visitors to Delaware Seashore State Park are being warned to steer clear of designated zones around the Indian River Inlet starting Monday as state officials begin testing an upgraded sand bypass system.
The Delaware Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Control (DNREC) announced that the mechanical system — designed to mimic the natural flow of sand along the coast — will be tested in multiple phases through early August.
The testing schedule runs Monday through Thursday, 7 a.m. to 2 p.m., on the following dates: July 14–17, July 21–24, July 28–31, and August 4–6.
During these times, high-pressure pumps will move large volumes of sand from the inlet’s south side, where it tends to accumulate, to the eroding north side.
Officials warn that this creates unstable and hazardous conditions both in the water and on the beach.

The saturated sand can pose a risk of entrapment, and the adjacent waters may produce dangerous rip currents.
Barriers, signage, and white buoys with orange bands will mark the restricted areas, which remain off-limits even when testing isn’t actively underway.
DNREC staff will be stationed at public access points on both sides of the inlet to guide beachgoers and enforce safety rules.
Violators could face fines ranging from $50 to $250.
The sand bypass system, which had been offline for several years, has recently undergone major upgrades including new pumps and an electric motor.
DNREC officials say the summer testing is critical to ensuring the system is fully functional before it is put into regular operation.
While most of the park’s beaches will remain open, officials urge all visitors to respect posted warnings and avoid the marked zones.
Updates on the project will be shared via DNREC and Delaware Seashore State Park social media channels.",https://delawarelive.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Screenshot-2025-07-14-at-11.38.08-AM.png,,,2025-07-14 12:22:00.476384

Media appeals ruling.,"Anita Lee, Sun Herald and Taylor Vance",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/07/14/mississippi-judge-secrecy-sealed-case-coast-uninsured-motorist-tickets-securix/,A Jackson County judge sealed a politically sensitive court case without a hearing. All Mississippi court files are presumed open unless their are closed with notice and a hearing under guidelines established in 1990.,"A Jackson County Chancery Court judge is denying the public access to a case that involves several politically connected Mississippians and their failed venture to ticket uninsured motorists using cameras and artificial intelligence.
Media companies Mississippi Today and the Sun Herald have filed for relief with the state Supreme Court, arguing that Chancery Judge Neil Harris improperly closed the court file without notice and a hearing to consider alternatives. The media outlets say the court file should be opened.
Mississippi Today in June filed its motion asking that Harris unseal the case, which he denied six days later. 
Gulfport attorney Henry Laird writes in the media companies’ petition for state Supreme Court review, “The Chancery Court sealing the entire court file both before and after Mississippi Today’s motion to unseal the file violates the public and press’ cherished right of openness and access to its public court system and records.” 
Mississippi judges have long followed a 1990 state Supreme Court decision that says, “A hearing must be held in which the press is allowed to intervene on behalf of the public and present argument, if any, against closure.” 
Instead, Harris said he found no hearing necessary after reviewing the pleadings to open the file. The case, he said, is between two private companies.
“There are no public entities included as parties,” he wrote, “and there are no public funds at issue. Other than curiosity regarding issues between private parties, there is no public interest involved.”
The case involves what is usually a public function: Issuing tickets to the owners of uninsured vehicles.  And, according to one party to the case, the Mississippi Department of Public Safety is owed $345,000 from the uninsured motorist program.

Since the entire court file is closed, the public is unable to see why the judge sealed the case. The Mississippians said in the Chancery Court case that they have  “substantial” business interests to protect and “a lot of political importance,” an attorney opposing them said in a related federal case that is not sealed.

Jackson County Chancery Judge Neil Harris
Georgia-based Securix LLC signed up its first Mississippi client in 2021, the city of Ocean Springs, an agreement with the city showed. Securix developed a program that uses traffic cameras, artificial intelligence and bulk data on insured motorists to identify the owners of vehicles without insurance.
To sign on other Mississippi cities, Securix enlisted three well-known consultants, Quinton Dickerson, Josh Gregory and Robert Wilkinson. Dickerson and Gregory are Republican political operatives in Jackson who have run numerous state and local campaigns and advise many of the state’s top elected officials. Wilkinson, a Coast attorney, has represented local governments and government agencies, including the city of Ocean Springs.
MS business partnership sours
In 2023, the Mississippians formed QJR LLC. Their company entered a 50-50 partnership with Securix called Securix Mississippi.
Securix Mississippi sold the cities of Biloxi, Pearl and Senatobia on the uninsured driver program. 
Fees collected from uninsured drivers were apportioned to the company, the cities and the Department of Public Safety, the operating agreement with Biloxi showed.
The citations offered three options, according to copies included in a federal lawsuit filed by three Mississippi residents who received them:

Call a toll-free number and provide proof of insurance.
Enter a diversion program that charges a $300 fee and includes a short online course and requires agreement that the vehicle will not be driven uninsured on public roadways.
Contest the ticket in court and risk $510 in fines and fees, plus the potential of a one-year driver’s license suspension.

The Securix Mississippi partnership soon soured.
Securix Chairman Jonathan Miller of Georgia said in a sworn court declaration submitted in the federal case that he was subjected around March 2024 to a “freeze out” by members and/or employees of QJR. They stopped giving him information, Miller said.
The Department of Public Safety in August pulled the plug on the controversial ticketing program, shutting off the company’s access to the insured driver database.
In September, QJR filed its Chancery Court lawsuit against Securix LLC. 
What is known about the case comes from documents in the federal court file. QJR claims the company and its members have been defamed by Miller and Securix and wants their 50-50 business partnership dissolved.
The Chancery Court case does not even show up when the parties are searched for by name. 
With a case number gleaned from the federal court file, a search of chancery records shows only that the case is under seal.
Normally, when a case is under seal, the docket would still be available. A docket lists all records and proceedings in a case. While sealed records are listed and described, they can’t be viewed. 
“There is no court file,” attorney Laird said in asking the Supreme Court to review Judge Harris’ decision to leave the file sealed. “There is no docket sheet. There is absolutely no access on the part of the public or press to their public court file in this case.”
Judge closes file without public notice
All Mississippi court files are presumed open unless they are closed with notice and a hearing under guidelines established in the 1990 case Gannett River States Publishing Co. vs. Hand.
“It appears that the judge ignored what has been settled law in Mississippi since 1990,” said retired Jackson attorney Leonard Van Slyke, who represented Gannett in the case and still advises the media.
He added, “Since that time, there have not been many efforts to close a courtroom or a court file because the rules are pretty clear as to when that can be done. It is obvious from the rules that this would be a rare occurrence.”
 A court file can be closed only if a party in the case requesting closure can show an “overriding interest” that would be prejudiced by publicity.
The Supreme Court said in 1990 that the public is entitled to at least 24 hours’ notice — on the court docket — before a judge considers closure. As a representative of the public, the media has a right to a hearing before a court file or proceeding is closed.
At the hearing, the judge must consider the least restrictive closure possible and reasonable alternatives. The judge also must make findings that explain why alternatives to closure were rejected.
The court wrote in Gannett vs. Hand:
“A transcript of the closure hearing should be made public and if a petition for extraordinary relief concerning a closure order is filed in this Court, it should be accompanied by the transcript, the court’s findings of fact and conclusions of law, and the evidence adduced at the hearing upon which the judge bases the findings and conclusions.”
Because Judge Harris held no hearing, the high court will have a scant record on which to base its review. Without a court record, Laird pointed out in his filing, the public can have no confidence the judge made a sound decision.
Kevin Goldberg, an attorney who serves as vice president and First Amendment expert at the nonpartisan, nonprofit Freedom Forum, said the First Amendment guarantees the public access to courts.
In the Securix case, he said, a private business was doing work normally performed by a police department or other public agency, and residents could be snared into legal proceedings when they received tickets and public funds were involved.
“These are not private people in a small town, going about their business,” Goldberg said. “These people’s business is the public’s business . . . I think that means they need to accept that they’re going to be scrutinized all the time, including when they voluntarily make a decision to go to court.”

Josh Kimbrell, pictured during a Senate Judiciary Committee meeting March 15, 2022, was accused of stealing more than $2 million from his business partner in a recent lawsuit. (File/Travis Bell/STATEHOUSE CAROLINA/Special to the SC Daily Gazette)A civil lawsuit accuses a state senator who’s running for governor of funneling more than $2 million from his aircraft chartering company into personal and campaign expenses.
Sen. Josh Kimbrell’s campaign dismissed the lawsuit as a political move.
The lawsuit was filed in Greenville County just over two weeks after the Boiling Springs Republican announced his candidacy for governor, joining a growing field of candidates ahead of the June 2026 primary election. Filing for the election is still months away.
“We’re witnessing a regrettable, uncorroborated case of lawfare from a disgruntled, absent business partner with no function or daily involvement in our operations,” Kimbrell said in a statement provided by his campaign. “I’m confident that the facts will come to light, leading to full vindication.”
Kimbrell has not yet filed a formal response to the accusations.
And he did not immediately respond directly to text and voicemail messages left by the SC Daily Gazette.
Two GOP candidates officially enter SC governor’s race

Kimbrell “used a series of complex financial transactions” to move money from his private charter aircraft company, Exodus Aircraft, to his own bank accounts, business partner Frank Rogers of Greenville claimed in the lawsuit filed last Thursday.
That included putting money from the company into Kimbrell’s own PayPal account, transferring money to his wife, who had no stake in the company, and using credit cards in Rogers’ name, the lawsuit claimed.
Kimbrell also established a second company called Exodus Airways, which he used to divert payments to himself, “capitalizing upon the confusion caused by the strikingly similar name,” the lawsuit alleges.
Kimbrell would tell clients to write checks to “Exodus Air,” allowing him to cash the checks in the Exodus Airways bank account instead of the legitimate Exodus Aircraft account, with the help of a trusted banker, Rogers claimed in a sworn statement.
Exodus Aircraft, which specializes in chartered flights for private businesses, was formed in 2017 in Delaware but operates out of Spartanburg, according to business filings. Rogers bought stake in half the company in October 2022, he said in the statement.
Kimbrell, 40, was first elected to the state Senate in 2020, when he ousted longtime Democratic Sen. Glenn Reese. In November, Kimbrell easily defeated a Democrat challenger for the district that’s entirely in Spartanburg County.
The lawsuit claims Kimbrell began funneling money from the charter business in early 2023 for campaign expenses as well as “recreational and personal uses,” the lawsuit claimed.
Kimbrell secretly pursued business loans using falsified information and, in one case, forged Rogers’ signature, the lawsuit claimed.
When Rogers, who shared ownership of the company with Kimbrell, questioned the company’s financial difficulties, Kimbrell tried to blame Rogers and refused to show him the company’s financial records, the lawsuit claimed.
Rogers determined about $2 million was so far unaccounted for, but that amount could rise, he claimed in the lawsuit.
Kimbrell has since resigned his role as manager of the company, but he still has control of its finances, Rogers claimed. If any more money is diverted from the company, it could be forced to close, according to the lawsuit.
Rogers is asking a judge to intervene and institute a temporary restraining order barring Kimbrell from moving money the company earns from chartering its single 30-passenger jet. If his case is successful, Rogers is also seeking a to-be-determined amount of money accounting for the funds he claims were diverted and any other losses, according to the lawsuit.",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/kimbrell-laughing-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 12:22:00.476384

(Photo by Ethan DeWitt/New Hampshire Bulletin)A federal district court judge in New Hampshire issued an injunction against President Donald Trump’s executive order to eliminate birthright citizenship, and held that a group of noncitizens suing the government have class action standing to sue.
Judge Joseph Laplante’s decision will stop the executive order from taking effect July 27 in New Hampshire and other states that don’t currently have injunctions, but the decision has been stayed until July 17 to allow the government to appeal, he announced in court Thursday.
Issued in January, the executive order, titled “Protecting the meaning and value of American citizenship,” seeks to redefine the 14th Amendment to deny automatic citizenship to children born in the U.S. to undocumented parents. The executive order would reverse more than a century of precedent establishing automatic citizenship, and plaintiffs say it would unfairly deprive them of government benefits, such as SNAP and Medicaid.
On Thursday, Laplante agreed.
“The deprivation of U.S. citizenship and the abrupt change of policy that was longstanding, perpetuated by executive order and not statute … that’s irreparable harm,” he said. “It is the greatest privilege that exists in the world, and that’s what makes it irreparable harm.”
Cody Wofsy, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Immigrant Rights Project, which helped bring the lawsuit, hailed the ruling in a press conference after the hearing.
“This is going to protect every single child around the country from this lawless, unconstitutional, cruel executive order,” he said. “We appreciate the court’s rapid consideration of this issue.”
Laplante’s order comes weeks after the Supreme Court limited the ability of federal courts to block such policies. In that landmark decision, Trump v. Casa, Inc., the high court ruled that nationwide injunctions exceed the authority granted to courts by Congress, and that relief should be targeted only to plaintiffs. But the ruling made an exception for class action lawsuits: national injunctions are possible in those cases if the classes are national, it held.
Thursday’s decision in the U.S. District Court of New Hampshire is the first time a court has approved a class action lawsuit designation in order to block the president’s anti-birthright citizenship order. The ACLU had scrambled to file the class action lawsuit within days of the Casa decision in June.
A new interpretation of citizenship
In issuing its executive order, the Trump administration has argued that the longstanding interpretation of who received citizenship under the 14th Amendment is wrong.
That amendment, passed after the Civil War, was designed in part to overturn the Dred Scott Supreme Court decision and grant citizenship to formerly enslaved individuals. But it also established the tradition that those who are born within the U.S. automatically attain citizenship — with exceptions for children of enemy combatants and diplomats — an understanding that was upheld in the 1898 case of U.S. v. Wong Kim Ark.
Birthright citizenship battle ignites questions about Wabanaki rights

Trump, in his executive order, contended instead that the 14th Amendment does not apply to children of noncitizens because it refers specifically to people “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States. Lawyers for the Department of Justice have argued that a person must have legal domicile in the U.S. to qualify for birthright citizenship.
But plaintiffs say that interpretation is ahistorical and unconstitutional, and say birthright citizenship is “bedrock law.” They have noted that should the executive order be allowed to stand, families could be unable to access needed social safety net programs, and some siblings could be split between citizens and noncitizens, depending on whether they were born before or after the order.
And lawyers for the plaintiffs have said the order could render children of noncitizens stateless if the country of their parents’ origin does not recognize their nationality.
Objections to the class action
In federal court on Thursday, attorneys on both sides largely sidestepped the larger debate on the meaning of birthright citizenship and focused on the class certification question.
The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, include “Barbara,” an asylum applicant from Honduras who is living in New Hampshire and expecting a child; “Susan,” a student visa holder from Taiwan living in Utah, who gave birth to “Sarah” in April; and “Mark,” a Brazilian citizen living in Florida who gave birth to “Matthew” in March. The names are pseudonymous to protect their identities.
Two of the plaintiffs, Barbara and Susan, have older children, but because the executive order denies citizenship only to babies of noncitizens born after Feb.19, those children’s citizenship status is not in question.
The plaintiffs had attempted to include both the infants and their parents in the class action lawsuits, but Laplante said he would narrow the class certification to include just the infants.
The defendants, who include the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, argued that there was a lack of “commonality” between the plaintiffs due to the plaintiffs’ differing immigration status. The lawyers said a class certification should not be established without the court conducting discovery to determine the domicile status of each plaintiff. They also argued the pseudonyms meant it is impossible to determine whether the plaintiffs are representative of the class.
Eric Hamilton, an attorney for the government, argued in court that the class certification should not be granted because the plaintiffs were too different from each other, and that the court should not grant a national class certification because it would deny the ability for other district courts to arrive at their own rulings.
Instead, Hamilton contended, any injunction by Laplante should apply only to the jurisdiction of the New Hampshire U.S. District Court, and not the whole country. Laplante rejected that reasoning.
“Plaintiffs are now trying to accomplish through a different means what the United States Supreme Court held was beyond the equitable jurisdiction of different district courts,” Hamilton said.
But Wofsy countered that the plaintiffs are a “classic example” of the group of people who meet the standards for a class action lawsuit.
The government is expected to appeal Laplante’s ruling to the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, and lawyers will push for an expedited process there.
Thursday’s court order does not affect another New Hampshire lawsuit against Trump’s birthright citizenship: New Hampshire Indonesian Community Support, et al. v. Trump. In that case, the Indonesian support organization and individual members sued to block the executive order. In February, Laplante issued an injunction against the executive order that was narrowly tailored to apply to the plaintiffs — and not the whole country — and is likely not affected by the Casa decision. That lawsuit is proceeding before the 1st Circuit Court of Appeals.
Laplante’s decision to issue a national injunction Thursday stands in contrast to his decision in the February case to narrow his ruling. At that time, he had called it inappropriate for a district court judge to issue a national injunction.
On Thursday, he clarified that position.
“It’s a better process to narrow these types of decisions and not have judges create national policy,” Laplante said at one point during oral arguments.
But at a different point, he added: “I wasn’t a judge that was comfortable with a national injunction. But class action is different.”

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Sherman Smith/Kansas Reflector)TOPEKA — Panasonic is delaying full production in its De Soto battery plant because of dropping electric car sales and U.S. policies that do not support electric cars, international media reports.
The $4 billion economic development project, billed as the largest in Kansas history, is threatened because of decreased electric car sales at Tesla and skepticism from President Donald Trump about encouraging electric vehicle adoption, according to the Nikkei Asia news outlet.
The plant was expected to reach full production by March 2027, and a new target date has not been set, Nikkei reported.
The president’s “big, beautiful bill” eliminates tax credits for the purchase of electric vehicles as of Sept. 30, along with eliminating or decreasing multiple green energy tax credits.
The De Soto plant, which was projected to create 4,000 jobs, has a grand opening scheduled Monday.
The Panasonic plant began construction in 2023 after receiving Kansas tax credits, through a program known as APEX that the state created to draw in large economic development projects. Incentives include rebates on capital investments, payroll and staff training.
The APEX program also lowers the corporate income tax rate by 0.5% for Kansas businesses for the fiscal year after a megadeal is signed. Under the APEX deal, Panasonic was expected to receive $829.2 million over 10 years.
The company had plans to provide at least 4,000 jobs, increasing the state’s annual labor income by more than $505 million. The state anticipated the project will create an additional 4,000 jobs through suppliers and community businesses. The state expected to see a $26 return for every $1 invested in tax incentives.
The De Soto community also offered incentives that were based on the company agreeing to employ 2,500 employees, well below the estimated full employment of 4,000.
The city offered to complete $229 million of public infrastructure projects, such as road improvements, and water and sewer projects, using Tax Increment Financing funds, a common economic development tool that uses increased property taxes received from developments to fund projects.
Oklahoma had been in competition with Kansas to land this plant. Oklahoma officials offered the company nearly $700 million in incentives to build in the state.
De Soto Mayor Rick Walker said he has not been notified of any changes in Panasonic’s plans to change their production schedule or their hiring at the plant, but he also was not surprised. The federal approach to a company trying to bring manufacturing to the U.S. has been disappointing, he said.
“We have a company reshoring jobs and then every activity (the federal government) takes has worked against that,” Walker said.
The slowdown of electric vehicle sales has been anticipated, he said, but he added that projections for sales overall still show strong market opportunities.
“What was being reported earlier, by 2030, was almost 50% of new car sales could be EVs, and they’re scaling that back to 40,” he said. “We’re going from less than 10% to 40. It’s still a growth market. I think we’re still in a good position.”
Walker said he hopes the news doesn’t overshadow the De Soto and Kansas community’s excitement about grand opening events on Monday.
“We’re super pumped that they’re having the grand opening Monday. It’s a big day and it’s a big thing in our area for sure,” he said.
Panasonic has already hired 1,100 employees, and 1,100 housing units are being built in De Soto, said Theo Stavropoulos, spokesman for the Kansas Department of Commerce.
“Local businesses are seeing the influx of new customers, driving local sales tax revenues up and reducing the local property tax mill levy,” he said. “As Panasonic’s production ramps up, Kansas will continue rising to meet the new economic opportunities made possible by their transformational investment.”
Stavropoulos did not answer questions about how slowing the production timeline might affect Kansas incentives offered to develop the project.

He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Morgan Chilson/Kansas Reflector)HAYS — Ellis County artist Amy Warfield heard about the Kansas Senate’s online portal for public feedback through the Be the Bear Facebook group, where politically minded women shared the link among the group’s 36,000 members.
The Senate Committee on Government Efficiency, or COGE, set up the portal to gather input on how to streamline government like Elon Musk was doing under the DOGE umbrella at the federal level.
“I thought, ‘I definitely have at least something to say,’ and I shared it to a lot of people I know, because I knew they probably had input for how to make our state government more efficient,” Warfield said during a conversation for the Kansas Reflector podcast at the Paisley Pear restaurant in downtown Hays.


In early February, Warfield dashed off her thoughts on how the Legislature should rein in Attorney General Kris Kobach’s “vanity lawsuits,” which had targeted immigrants, trans kids, and the abortion pill mifepristone.
She wasn’t surprised when she didn’t hear back.
The vast majority of the first 1,600 public comments submitted through the COGE portal were at odds with the Republican leadership of the committee, which refused to make the comments public in accordance with open records law until the committee’s work for the session had ended. Kansas Reflector independently obtained leaked comments early, and revealed that people in the state were asking lawmakers to maintain abortion rights, avoid private school vouchers, expand Medicaid, stop hurting trans kids, and legalize marijuana.
COGE meanwhile worked to target social welfare programs and public employees.
“I kind of felt like from the beginning, when I heard about COGE, that it was just kind of a fishing expedition and that they were looking for the responses that they wanted,” Warfield said. “And I just assumed from the start that if they didn’t get the responses that they were looking for, then it would just kind of go away.
“So I felt like there probably was a benefit for us to speak the truth of how we feel about government efficiency, because I think that they shouldn’t just get the responses that they want. I think they need to get the truthful responses. And for me, this was a truthful response — continued frustration about the types of lawsuits we’re pursuing over and over again, because that’s our dollars being spent on that.”
Warfield said her attention to politics makes her somewhat of an outlier where she lives. Paying attention to the Legislature is “exhausting for people,” she said, and the Republicans who dominate politics in rural Kansas don’t have to engage with the public or defend their seats.
For Warfield, who is involved with Ellis County Democrats, local politics is about the “food and farm portion of our party.” Her idea of political activism is volunteering with Feeding Hays at a local church each week.
There’s “a huge disconnect” between what the GOP-led Legislature prioritizes “and what is really affecting everyday people in Ellis County,” she said.
“And,” she added, “what we’re focusing on, which is taking care of people in our community, supporting them, getting meals, things like that. I don’t really see the Legislature being focused on things like that.”
Warfield said she grew up in Garden City and attended community college there before getting a fine arts degree from Fort Hays State University. She works at the local domestic and sexual violence shelter and said she is “first and foremost an artist.”
She described herself as a landscape and figurative painter who works mostly in oil and watercolor. Her subject matter deals with the “landscape and people and atmosphere of western Kansas,” she said.
People who think there’s nothing to see in western Kansas might be surprised.
“My work not only focuses on the beauty that you can still find here, but also some of the ugliness too,” Warfield said. “And just that ramshackle shed in the right light can be really beautiful. And just that importance of lighting and appreciating unappreciated spaces.”
Warfield was dismayed this year when the Legislature decided to undercut arts funding, reducing the state’s investment from $1.5 million to $1 million.
For a place like Hays, she said, the budget cut might mean a reduction in programming, like art classes for children, as well as fewer exhibits or murals.
And, she said, it sends a signal to young people who appreciate the arts, and who may be inclined to leave the state, that lawmakers think they aren’t important or worth the investment.
“I think it just makes it more exhausting,” Warfield said. “You feel less appreciated by your government. I think it also leads to a certain amount of apathy of like, ‘Why pay attention and why care?’ Because they certainly don’t.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/P7090298-1024x576.jpg,,,2025-07-14 11:12:27.735136

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates.

After a period of unprecedented drought and wildfires in Massachusetts last fall and winter, the urgency around addressing drought seems to have dissipated.  
The post Drought management not included in Healey’s $3 billion environmental bond bill  appeared first on CommonWealth Beacon.","AFTER A PERIOD of unprecedented drought and wildfires last year spurred urgent calls for water conservation in Massachusetts, the arrival of flood season has seemingly washed away that momentum – with no policy to directly tackle drought included in Gov. Maura Healey’s environmental bond bill, which outlines the administration’s climate priorities. 
As climate change fuels worsening drought and wildfires across the Northeast, Massachusetts lawmakers have pushed for three bills – two in the Senate and one in the House – that would codify the state’s existing drought management task force and allow the head of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs to mandate water conservation during severe droughts, including the ability to limit nonessential outdoor water use. However, none of the bills were incorporated into the bond bill Healey filed on June 24. 
Healey’s environmental bond bill proposes nearly $3 billion to strengthen infrastructure, fund climate resilience projects across the state, protect water and natural resources, streamline permitting for housing and restoration, and help communities prepare for extreme weather and environmental challenges. It has drawn praise from environmental groups like The Nature Conservancy.  
The administration declined to answer questions about why the drought management legislation was not included in the bond bill, but suggested the issue is a priority. “With droughts increasing in severity and frequency, our administration is committed to being a partner with communities to help them prepare and respond,” the governor’s office said in a statement. “We will review any legislation that reaches the Governor’s desk.” 
During the height of last year’s drought season, the Healey administration called for more water conservation. In a November 19 press release, the state’s energy and environmental affairs secretary, Rebecca Tepper, said, “Water conservation is more important than ever. We urge municipalities, residents, and businesses — including those with private wells — to help us reduce stress on our water systems. We need to work together to ensure we have enough clean drinking water, protect wildlife habitats, and maintain effective fire control.” 
Drought management legislation would allow for a regional water conservation strategy. Proponents say that this is essential because drought and wildfires aren’t often contained within municipal boundaries.  
Bond bills filed by the governor are more likely to be taken up by the notoriously unproductive Legislature. Big policy packages like the state budget or bond bills are often vehicles for passing important policy. 
The drought management bill passed the Senate last session as part of the 2024 climate law, but the House didn’t take it up. This session, the bill has been reported favorably by the Senate from the Joint Committee on Environment and Natural Resources to the Senate Ways and Means Committee. It will continue making its way through on the Senate side but it’s not clear if the House will move on it. 
Sen. Jamie Eldridge, who filed one of the three drought management bills, advocated for the legislation to be included in Healey’s bond bill and expressed disappointment that it was not included. 
“With the continued impacts of climate change leading to extremes in water, whether it’s flooding or drought, the state needs stronger tools to regulate water use and to protect clean water access for residents and communities across Massachusetts,” said Eldridge. “In the past 10 years, we’ve seen a growing number of regions of the state designated as having drought conditions, and so there is urgency to passing the drought management bill.” 
Eldridge praised the bond bill for its increased investments in environmental programs but said that it is “pretty light on traditional environmental policy.” Measures banning plastic bags, addressing PFAS or “forever chemicals,” and raising tax credits for landowners who use their land for conservation are all policies that should have made it into the environmental bond bill, he said.  
Eldridge is expected to testify at a July 15 hearing to push lawmakers to tack on the drought management bill and several other pieces of legislation to the larger bond bill.  
Steve Long, the director of policy at The Nature Conservancy, largely praised Healey’s bill and said that some policies it includes that don’t directly address drought or wildfires will still lessen the impacts of both. Specifically, he noted that the bond bill includes funds to remove obsolete dams which can improve the health of rivers and $30 million that is directed toward forestry and tree planting.   
“Even though you might not see the words wildfire and you might not see the word drought in the bond bill, if you keep natural systems healthy, that will both reduce the chance of wildfires and the impacts of drought,” said Long. 
Average spring and summer temperatures in Massachusetts have climbed over the past five decades, and these warmer, sunnier seasons dry out soil and vegetation, making wildfires and droughts more likely and severe.  
Mass Rivers Alliance, an advocacy group, emphasized the urgency of passing drought management legislation as the climate continues to warm.  
“The urgency is that we are experiencing drought in new ways, and it’s happening on a fairly regular basis,” said Heather Clish, the group’s policy director. “We want to be prepared every time we experience drought to help sustain the water supply in our rivers during drought period.”

On May 13, 2025, Nathaniel Wallace Suter died suddenly while running with friends in Montpelier, Vermont. He was 52.
Nathan lived his life with remarkable energy, courage, and compassion. Born in the Canal Zone in Panama, he grew up in Poughkeepsie, New York, where he and his family were longtime members of the Bulls Head-Oswego Friends Meeting. In elementary and middle school, his intellectual curiosity was encouraged by the 6:30 Club, a reading group organized by Judge Albert Rosenblatt. Always athletic, Nathan became an accomplished distance runner in high school and maintained his love of running for the rest of his life. 
As a student at Haverford College in Pennsylvania, Nathan excelled in both track and cross-country and majored in photography; after graduation, he moved to the Bay Area to attend the San Francisco Art Institute, where he earned an MFA in photography. He then co-founded Root Division, a non-profit center for art and artists in downtown San Francisco that remains vital today. He taught at Eastside College Preparatory School in East Palo Alto, which serves students historically underrepresented in higher education.
In 2001, Nathan married Morgan Lloyd, a fellow Haverford graduate, and in 2006 they settled in Morgan’s home state of Vermont. Their daughter Amani was born in 2006, followed by their son Asa in 2008. His family became the center of his rich and busy life.
Nathan was as committed to social justice and service as he was passionate about athletics and art. He directed the Helen Day Art Center (now The Current) in Stowe, Vermont, for a decade, establishing youth and adult educational programs and a professional development program for emerging artists. In 2016 he co-founded BUILD Consulting, helping organizations and individuals develop strategic plans to achieve their missions. He was undaunted and even energized by the challenges he or his clients faced, and he had an inspiring belief in his own potential and in that of others. Nathan served as a board member of Migrant Justice and treasurer of the Peace and Justice Center in Burlington, Vermont. After the devastating floods across northern New England in the summer of 2023, he joined the Montpelier Commission for Recovery and Resilience. He coached track and field and assisted in coaching the cross-country and Nordic skiing teams at the Montpelier Roxbury public schools. His efforts helped to revitalize the track and field program in central Vermont. Athletes of all skill levels thrived under his mentorship, and knew they would hear his booming voice cheering them on from the sidelines.
Though Nathan was deeply rooted in his community, he was also an adventurous traveler, who traveled all over the world. He spent time in Guatemala, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica with his family and had formative trips to Mexico, Cuba, and Venezuela with friends. Both at home and abroad, Nathan often captured his joy and appreciation through photography. A consummate connector, Nathan never hesitated to strike up conversations with strangers in English or Spanish, and he made lasting friendships during every trip and every chapter of his life.
The messages Morgan, Amani, and Asa have received in the weeks since Nathan’s death are extraordinary not only for their number but for their consistency: over and over, those who knew Nathan remember that he made them feel loved, appreciated, and worthwhile, and that he challenged and inspired them to be their best selves. They recall his excellent hugs, his laughter, and his bottomless generosity. “Nathan was a light,” one colleague wrote, “and he seemed to use every minute of his time spreading that light to those around him.” Those lucky enough to have known Nathan will always treasure their time with him, and always wish there had been more. 
Nathan is survived by his wife Morgan Lloyd, his daughter Amani Suter, and his son Asa Lloyd of Montpelier; his father Robert Suter of Kennett Square, Pennsylvania; his sister Katherine Fisher and her family of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; many other beloved family members; and hundreds of friends. Nathan’s mother, Valerie Suter, passed away on May 22, 2025, after suffering a fall in Montpelier.

A celebration of Barbara’s life is scheduled for Monday, August 11th at 11am at the First United Methodist Church in Burlington on 21 Buell Street. There will be no visiting hours. Internment will occur at the convenience of the family.
In lieu of flowers. The Norton family requests that a donation be made to either the First United Methodist Church in Burlington or the United Church of Fairfax, 8 Fletcher Rd., Fairfax, VT 05454.

Barbara Norton, 84, died peacefully in her sleep during the early morning hours of July 1, 2025, at Birchwood Terrace Rehabilitation and Healthcare.
Barbara Jean Perry Norton was born on October 5, 1940, to Francis and Melba (Chandler) Perry. She grew up in Fairfax, VT and graduated from Bellows Free Academy – Fairfax in 1958. She completed a secretarial program at Champlain College the following year. Barbara married Arthur Norton on November 16, 1963, and after a short time living in Burlington, they raised three sons in Fairfax. When she wasn’t working or being a parent, she enjoyed sewing, quilting, and reading.
Barbara worked several jobs during her life including The Burlington Free Press, Northwestern Medical Center in St. Albans, IBM in Essex Jct., and as the assistant town clerk in Fairfax. She was also a member of Order of Eastern Stars in Fairfax as well as being one of the early volunteers for Fairfax Rescue.
In the 1980’s, Barbara felt the desire to become a minister but had only completed one year of college. After completing the requirements to become a Certified Lay Pastor, she led congregations in North Hyde Park and Eden Mills, VT. She took courses at CCV and transferred to Johnson State College where she graduated in 1994. She enrolled in Boston University’s School of Theology and earned a Master of Divinity in May of 1998. After graduating from BU, she became a minister in Eastport, Maine.
After retiring from the ministry, she and Arthur moved back to Vermont and settled in Chittenden County, eventually residing at Cathedral Square in downtown Burlington. In the years after Arthur’s death in 2012, Barbara was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and Dementia. She spent the final seven years of her life in the memory care unit of Birchwood Terrace Nursing Home in Burlington.
Barbara is survived by her sons and daughters in law Jim and Carol of Newburyport, MA, Joel and Pam Norton of Essex Jct., VT, and Jon and Christina Norton of West Springfield, MA. She is also survived by her 7 grandchildren Jonathan, Spencer, Jack, Gwen, Nick, Abigail, and Lillian well as several cousins. She was predeceased by her parents, her husband, and her brother, Rev. James M. Perry.
Barbara’s family would like to thank the staff at Birchwood Terrace for their excellent care for her during the past seven years.

[…],"The Missouri State Board of Education meets for a board retreat at Canterbury Hill Winery and Restaurant Wednesday (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).New members of the Missouri State Board of Education discovered their powers to direct schools are more limited than they expected during a retreat last week.
The board spent Wednesday and Thursday talking about the powers it has — and those it does not — to impact a public education system they’d like to tweak.
“People around this table are accountable for change. I don’t think people want the status quo for education,” Brooks Miller, a board member from Sunshine Beach, said Wednesday. “That is why I get nervous when I think about how little authority we have but how much accountability we are subject to.”
Miller, a newly minted board member, was one of multiple board members beginning to learn just how limited their power can be during the two-day meeting.
Board retreats are not a new concept for the Board of Education. The group last held a retreat in 2023 and featured the same guest speaker.
This one, though, stands out as the first with Commissioner of Education Karla Eslinger — who has been in her position for a year — and with a board where half of the six members are new.
In April, Gov. Mike Kehoe appointed Miller, Mike Matousek of Kansas City and Jon Otto of Kansas City to the board (alongside a fourth appointee who was not confirmed by the State Senate). Following their appointment hearings that month, they told The Independent that they see opportunity for change — with some more eager to shake things up than others.

Otto said he wanted to settle in and “see what is working” before launching initiatives, but he saw potential for “a lot of new things.”
Matousek, who previously worked for U.S. Rep. Sam Graves’s office and was a member of his local school board in Platte County, said he joined the state board to help transform education.
“Public education is changing in Missouri, and I’d rather be at the table,” he said.
Change, though, is hard to initiate from the board level, he learned during the retreat.
Core responsibilities
The Department of Elementary and Secondary Education hired David Renz, director emeritus with the Midwest Center for Nonprofit Leadership at the University of Missouri-Kansas City, to lead the board in an overview of its role.
Renz, who gave a similar presentation in 2023, shared a sobering reality.
“There is no board at any local level like this board,” Renz said. “And that has certain benefits, and that has certain problems.”
He described members of the board as “influencers,” ones who can steer people toward change but can’t spur high-level changes on their own.
The board’s largest power is hiring and directing the education commissioner, Renz told them. A key demonstration of this happened in 2017, when then-Gov. Eric Greitens ousted former education commissioner Margie Vandeven by stacking the board with five members willing to vote her out.
Vandeven returned to her job after Greitens resigned in disgrace in 2018 and the board membership again changed.
In recent years, the board has not conducted annual commissioner performance reviews. Eslinger, a former state senator who succeeded Vandeven, wants annual evaluations and board President Mary Schrag agrees.
Another area of influence is the strategic plan set by the board, which guides the commissioner’s leadership of the department. This document, which was discussed at length Thursday, outlines areas of focus and, oftentimes, change.
Schrag, a six-year board veteran from West Plains, said the board has been able to do “a lot in the last few years.”
In 2022, the board convened a blue ribbon commission to study the state’s teacher shortage. The commission’s recommendations became the blueprint for new laws passed last year, like a boost to teacher pay.
The board’s look at the formula that funds public schools, including a study it commissioned in 2023, spurred the creation of a task force dedicated to improving the formula.
“This board can be such a good voice for how to drive education,” said Kerry Casey, a board member from Chesterfield. “It is hard that we don’t own it, but we can be a voice.”

Pushback
Casey said she understands new members’ frustrations.
“It was certainly like that for me when I came on the board because we all want to make a difference,” she said. “We are a voice, but we don’t have the distinct responsibility to set the legislation.”
  State Board of Education appointee Mike Matousek, a Republican from Kansas City, speaks during a Senate Gubernatorial Appointments Committee hearing April 16 (Annelise Hanshaw/Missouri Independent).
Matousek took issue with the idea that the board has less power to set policy than local school boards. He served on the Platte County R-3 School Board until April, and he told the state board he felt “powerless” in that position.
He hoped as an appointed board member, not subject to elections, he could feel free, he said.
But, Wednesday, Matousek learned that board members rarely put items on the meeting agenda. He inquired whether he could send an email a week before the meeting to add an item.
No, Eslinger said, there’s a larger process. But no one fully explained much, except that the board typically reviews agenda items two months in advance.
“There will come a time when I am adding stuff to the agenda, and I want to know how to do it when that time comes,” Matousek said.
He also asked how the board can “initiate rulemaking.”
The board doesn’t write regulations on its own, Eslinger said. The department’s rules and regulations stem from legislation.
“We can only promulgate rules where we have authority, and it’s a pretty narrow lane,” the department’s general counsel Sarah Madden explained.
What if members of the public ask for a rule, Matousek inquired.
The department has to have authority granted by state lawmakers, Madden repeated.
Only a handful of the state’s education officials engage publicly with the legislative process, which primarily occurs when they explain the department’s budget request. But the department has a legislative liaison, Perry Gorrell, who testifies on proposed legislation and explains how bills might impact the department.
Miller asked how the board can speak against bills. He heard negative feedback about a bill passed this legislative session and wished there was an opportunity to fight bills from his position.
Casey said the board must be in agreement on their stance and, at times, has taken votes on “strong, important pieces of legislation.”
“The school board’s association and the teachers association are weighing in on lawmakers,” Matousek said. “My intent would be to weigh in more.”
The board avoids rejecting or promoting legislation, Schrag said, but it has requested “a seat at the table.”
“It is our role to be oversight, so it is a little bit more of a conflict for us to get more aggressive and more involved,” she said.
The board may change more in coming months, with two positions open. The governor may appoint a teacher representative to the board, whose position has historically been vacant since the position was created in 2018.

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.
There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

Bowhead whales are ingesting toxins driven by warming in Arctic, study finds

	Fur seals found dead last August on Alaska’s St. Paul Island had significant levels of saxitoxin in their bodies, as did several of the dead fish around them.
It was the clearest evidence ever found for this type of toxin-caused death, scientists say.
“I would say this is the absolute strongest case for saxitoxin poisoning in marine mammals anywhere,” said Kathi Lefebvre, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration research biologist and the lead author of a study detailing the findings, published in the journal Marine Mammals Science in May.
The discovery, a warning for local communities that rely on subsistence hunting, comes as long-term warming in the Bering and Chukchi seas is increasing the prevalence of a type of algae that produces saxitoxin is becoming more prevalent in these bodies of water.
Dangerous blooms of the Alexandrium have long been observed in more southern waters of Alaska, where paralytic shellfish poisoning is a well-recognized and sometimes deadly hazard. Clams are notorious for accumulating saxitoxin, and there are frequent safety advisories that warn people of specific sites’ shellfish poisoning dangers, and two labs in the state — one in Anchorage operated by the Department of Environmental Conservation and one in Sitka operated by the Sitka Tribe of Alaska — test harvested shellfish to determine whether it is safe for human consumption.

	Farther north, the emergence of large Alexandrium blooms and potentially dangerous saxitoxin levels is new. But, as Lefebvre explains it, the conditions to create those toxin hazards have been set up over decades and possibly even centuries.
Over time, ocean currents have carried bits of Alexandrium algae north, and over time, that algae has dropped to the bottom of the ocean. That created massive beds of dormant cysts, the equivalent of algal seeds.
The Bering, Chukchi and even Beaufort seas hold some of the highest concentrations of Alexandrium cysts ever found in the world, according to Don Anderson, a harmful algal specialist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Anderson led research teams that mapped out Alaska cyst beds over several years, including a bed in the Chukchi that he said is the biggest ever discovered.
Those cyst beds were dormant until recently, said Lefebvre, who works closely with Anderson.
“They’ve just been building and building and building. And then in the last couple decades – actually, the last 10 years, maybe — the bottom temperature finally was warm enough for cyst germination,” Lefebvre said. That appears to be the cause of the large blooms now being found routinely in the Bering, Chukchi and Beaufort seas, she said.
Dead fur seals and fish
In the case of the St. Paul fur seals, local beachcombers found 10 dead animals at a site on the northeastern side of the island called Benson Beach. It is a catchment site where marine debris, kelp and other items are known to accumulate, said Lauren Divine, director of the island’s Tribal ecosystem conservation office.
Tribal representatives managed to retrieve some of the dead seals, as well as some of the dead fish with them, said Divine, who works for the Aleut Community of St. Paul Island. They photographed the scene and gathered whatever information they could, and they contacted the NOAA-coordinated Alaska Marine Mammal Stranding Network and Anchorage-based veterinarian pathologist Kathy Burek-Huntington to continue the investigation, she said.
It was clearly a startling discovery, Divine said.
“This was something that everyone was quite alarmed (at) and noticed as something that was wrong in the ecosystem and something that really hadn’t ever been noticed or detected before,” she said. “So we were pretty adamant about really trying to do the best job that we could to collect as much information as we could about the event, and also with quite little capacity that we have out in the remote community.”
In all five of the adult seals tested, saxitoxin was found in feces or urine, significant because they indicate higher exposure when tainted food was eaten. Two fish were sampled as well, and both turned up saxitoxin in their intestines.
At about the same time, samples being taken by researchers in the southeastern Bering Sea — the same area where the dead fur seals would have been foraging — revealed dense Alexandrium blooms, large cyst beds and extremely high prevalence of saxitoxin in fish, zooplankton, clams and worms.
Anderson, who noted that his team has already found a huge Alexandrium cyst bed near St. Paul, the seal discovery is significant for two reasons.
“The seal mortality demonstrates that dangerous levels of toxin can accumulate there and that local communities need to be careful about what they consume during certain times of the year,” he said by email.

	Additionally, because scientists know that ocean currents run north from that region, “this might be yet another source of cells that can affect the Alaskan Arctic,” he said.
Lefebvre said all the evidence about the seals’ bodies, the fish samples and the environmental conditions were needed to show that the algal toxins killed the seals.
Up to now, it has not been possible to prove such a strong link between saxitoxin and marine mammal deaths, she said.
Mammals poisoned by saxitoxin are likely to disappear while at sea, she said. “They become paralyzed. They’re going to basically suffocate, not even drown, not even taking a breath of air, of water,” she said. “They’re going to just stop breathing.”
That contrasts with effects of a different type of algal toxin that, since the 1990s, has caused mass strandings and deaths since 1990 of marine mammals in California. That toxin, domoic acid, is produced by the Pseudo-nitzschia algae. Rather than causing paralysis, it overstimulates the nervous system, causing seizures that can result in death.
Lefebvre and others have documented thousands of cases of domoic acid poisoning among marine mammals in California, including sea lions, dolphins, seals, and whales, with animals easily seen by people on the beach. Mass die-offs of seabirds have also been documented.
So far, there have been no domoic acid poisoning cases documented in Alaska, though Lefebvre and her colleagues have consistently found low levels of it in various marine mammal species.
But a new study suggests that continued warming may make domoic acid a future problem in Alaska. The study, also led by Lefebvre, found that bowhead whales hunted over a two-decade period carried higher levels of both saxitoxin and domoic acid in years when waters were warm and sea ice was low.
Saxitoxin risks in various wild foods?
For now, saxitoxin and the paralytic shellfish poisoning it causes remain the main algal toxin concern in Alaska.
Among people, there were 132 reports of paralytic shellfish poisoning between 1993 to 2021, with the highest prevalence in Southeast Alaska and the Kodiak Archipelago, according to a bulletin published in 2022 by the Department of Health’s epidemiology section. The last fatal case concerned a person who ate shellfish at Unalaska Island.
Information about saxitoxin poisoning in wildlife has been more difficult to pinpoint.
In past years, it was suspected in some marine mammal deaths in Alaska, but it was not proven.
In the fall of 2017, four dead walruses found in the Bering Strait region had saxitoxin in their stomachs or intestines. They were among 39 walruses that, though otherwise in good body condition, were found dead in the region that August and September.
Two years later, another piece of the puzzle came when scientists retrieved clams from the Bering Strait area and the Chukchi Sea that had levels of saxitoxin above the thresholds for safe consumption by humans. That added another piece to the puzzle. Clams are an important part of the Pacific walrus diet, though the saxitoxin threshold for walruses has yet to be determined.
There are other suspected cases. For example, saxitoxin poisoning was a suggested cause of a 1987 sea otter die-off in the Kodiak Archipelago, though test results were inconclusive.
Beyond mammals, Alaska seabirds are known to have been killed by saxitoxin. That toxin caused a 2019 die-off of Arctic terns in the Juneau area; the birds had been feeding on sand lance, a type of fish known to accumulate saxitoxin.

	For people in St. Paul and elsewhere in Western Alaska, who live far away from the two Alaska labs that currently test shellfish for toxins, the new information is concerning, Divine said.
St. Paul residents and others in the Pribilof Islands harvest various types of animals beyond the clams and mussels that are routinely screened for consumption safety, she said. But there is not much known yet about saxitoxin levels in the full breadth of subsistence foods, she said. “We just don’t have robust information on how much is accumulating and how things are impacted across the food web,” she said.
A grant from a NOAA program called ECOHAB funded much of the work that supported the new study. The grant for that work, which is led by Lefebvre and Anderson, runs through this year. 
Anderson said the team just learned that it has been awarded ECOHAB grant funding for another year of work, part of what had been planned as a five-year follow-up program to better understand the saxitoxin risk in wild foods gathered in Indigenous subsistence harvests.
News of the one-year award is encouraging, but the scientists are worried about future years, Anderson said
SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOXThe Trump administration has targeted NOAA for deep cuts, he noted. The administration is proposing to entirely terminate NOAA’s National Centers for Coastal Ocean Sciences, the agency arm that supports research into algal toxins.
Termination of the National Centers for Coastal Ocean Sciences would end funding for NOAA’s entire Integrated Ocean Observing System. Within the IOOS is the Alaska Ocean Observing System, which monitors algal blooms, among other work.
Divine said the same people who have been drawn together by their concerns about toxins in the food web are also worried about the potential loss of scientific research.
“We have just an incredible amount of interest in this, and the funding that has been secured to really tackle this in a coordinated way is all on hold in this administration. And I do think that that’s worth noting,” she said.

The surprise win of a progressive candidate in the New York City mayoral Democratic primary is serving as an indication for some California progressives that they could have a shot at winning key offices in upcoming elections.
As CalMatters’ Yue Stella Yu explains, earlier this month New York Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani defeated eight other candidates including former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose affiliated political action committee raised a record-setting amount of money. Mamdani is a democratic socialist, and progressives in California have considered his victory as evidence that their stances on universal health care, taxing the rich and boosting the economy with climate-related jobs could resonate with voters.
The sentiment comes as some liberal California elected officials have shifted closer to the center in recent years, and in March critics on both sides of the political aisle slammed Gov. Gavin Newsom for making what they saw as a disingenuous appeal to conservatives with his podcast.
Despite an overwhelmingly Democratic populace, voters in November also passed a measure to stiffen penalties for drug and theft crimes and rejected progressive policies that would have expanded rent control, ended forced prison labor and raised the minimum wage. President Donald Trump also increased his vote share in nearly every county, and Republicans flipped three seats in the state Legislature. 
So what is it about Mamdani that California voters may find appealing?
One factor could be that Mamdani appealed to young voters about affordability issues, writes Stella. His proposal to freeze rent helped him garner 46% of the vote in renter-heavy neighborhoods. While most of California’s likely voters are homeowners, courting renters and younger voters to show up on Election Day could prove beneficial for progressives.

Mindy Romero, founder and director of the Center for Inclusive Democracy at the University of Southern California: “Progressives and Democrats and Republicans would all be very foolish not to be courting the youth vote. The problem is that they all do a generally pretty bad job of courting the youth vote.”

Judge orders ICE to halt raids in LA

A federal judge issued an order Friday directing federal immigration enforcement agents to temporarily halt carrying out immigration raids in Los Angeles without “reasonable suspicion,” write CalMatters’ Wendy Fry and Sergio Olmos.
A coalition of immigration and civil rights groups and local government agencies filed the class action lawsuit earlier this month, accusing federal authorities of violating constitutional protections against unreasonable searches and seizures. The coalition argues that federal agents conduct warrantless stops on people who simply appear to be Latino, and deny them due process rights to access to counsel.
The judge’s order prohibits agents from using four rationales, either alone or in combination, for conducting detention stops: “Apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or English with an accent, presence at a particular location (e.g. bus stop, car wash, tow yard, day laborer pick up site, agricultural site, ect), the type of work one does.”
The ruling does not prohibit the federal government from obtaining search warrants and carrying out workplace raids.
The Trump administration filed an appeal of the Friday ruling on Sunday, court records show. A hearing on whether this temporary restraining order may turn into a longer preliminary injunction is expected in the coming weeks.

Deaf asylum seeker held by ICE in CA detention center

Wendy also reports on how a California district court judge last week ordered officials at a San Diego immigration detention center to provide crucial assistance to a deaf asylum seeker who has been detained for more than four months.
The detainee, identified as Avirmed, arrived in the U.S. in February after fleeing Mongolia and seeking asylum from persecution because of his disability. Border officials transferred him to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, where he was placed in detention at the for-profit Otay Mesa Detention Center. Since his proceedings and detainment, Avirmed has not had access to a Mongolian Sign Language interpreter, according to the Disability Rights Legal Center.
The judge’s order directs officials at the detention facility to provide Avirmed with an appropriate interpreter. Immigration authorities were also ordered to redo two assessments, including a mental health review, that could affect Avirmed’s asylum request.
Avirmed’s case underscores the difference in border policies between Trump and President Joe Biden. Under Biden, asylum seekers who were not threats to public safety were often released on bond. Under Trump, some asylum seekers are detained while their cases move through immigration court, leading to record-high detention numbers.

Eleven major solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation.","In summary
Clean-energy projects have new deadlines for federal tax credits and limits on foreign parts, taking aim at California’s climate agenda. Eleven major solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation.


California’s drive to run its electric grid entirely on wind, solar and other clean sources of energy just got harder after President Donald Trump signed a sweeping new budget law.
The changes in federal tax incentives could affect the feasibility of new solar and wind projects as the state is counting on them to provide more electricity for Californians. A state law requires 100% of electricity to be powered by renewable, carbon-free sources by 2045, at the same time it’s moving to electrify cars and trucks. 
Incentives championed by former President Joe Biden were rolled back, shortening the timeline for the industry to obtain tax credits. Developers of wind and solar projects now face a new, shorter deadline for obtaining tax credits — most now expire at the end of 2027 instead of no sooner than 2032.
In addition, the new federal rules bar companies from accessing tax credits if they rely on major components from China or other “foreign entities of concern.” This restriction could hit California’s solar and wind industry especially hard, experts said.
The changes to tax credits are estimated to save the federal government approximately $499 billion from 2025–2034.
“For too long, the Federal Government has forced American taxpayers to subsidize expensive and unreliable energy sources like wind and solar,” Trump wrote in an executive order last week. “The proliferation of these projects displaces affordable, reliable, dispatchable domestic energy sources, compromises our electric grid, and denigrates the beauty of our Nation’s natural landscape.”
Projects can still be built without tax credits. But it puts more of a financial burden on their investors. In California, 11 solar projects and one onshore wind project now face potential delays or cancellation, according to an analysis of federal data by Atlas Public Policy provided to CalMatters. The projects are spread across the Central Valley, Inland Empire and Northern California.
Sean Gallagher, senior vice president of policy for the Solar Energy Industries Association, said in a statement that the industry was still “assessing what the federal tax bill means for them.” He warned the changes could jeopardize up to 35,700 solar jobs and 25 solar manufacturing facilities in California — including existing positions and factories as well as future projects that may now never materialize.
“The reality is, with or without clean energy tax credits, California’s energy demand is growing at a historic rate, and solar and storage are the fastest and most affordable way to meet that demand,” Gallagher said. 
California in recent years has been fast-tracking massive floating offshore wind farms 20 miles off the coasts of Humboldt County and Morro Bay. The federal changes add some uncertainty that could chill investment. But experts say it’s not a death knell for the industry because the projects weren’t set to seek federal permits or generate electricity for at least several years.
“Offshore wind is what we would call a long-lead project. It does take years and years to develop,” said Assemblymember Dawn Addis, former chair of the Assembly’s Offshore Wind Select Committee. “Solar is a little bit shorter of a time frame…but it’s also his incredibly erratic behavior when it comes to market stability overall that is also going to affect these projects in a negative way.”
Experts say in the long-run, the federal changes could drive up energy costs. 
“Tax credit savings are typically passed onto ratepayers through lower contracting costs. In the long term, the repeal of the tax credits will result in higher future electricity rates for customers,” the California Energy Commission told CalMatters.
Rising utility bills are already a major political headache for state leaders and a challenge for clean energy advocates who want the state to lead the way in making electricity cleaner, cheaper, and more reliable.
“The whole point of California’s climate policy is not just to reduce California’s carbon footprint — because we are less than 1% of global emissions — but to set an example and show that this can be done,” Berkeley economist Severin Borenstein told CalMatters. “There are going to be fewer other states following our example because it’s going to be more expensive.”",https://i0.wp.com/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/051023_Mojave-Wind-Turbines_LV_CM_09.jpg?fit=1024%2C682&amp;ssl=1,,,2025-07-14 09:09:35.732387

[[...]","Members of the South Dakota House of Representatives meet on Feb. 4, 2025, at the Capitol in Pierre. (Seth Tupper/South Dakota Searchlight)PIERRE — South Dakota lawmakers spent less taxpayer money attending out-of-state conferences and events during the recently concluded fiscal year.
When one legislator attends an out-of-state event, that’s counted as one trip. Members of the Legislature took 23 out-of-state trips that cost a total of $38,250 during the 2025 fiscal year, which ended June 30. That’s down from 66 trips for $103,500 during the prior fiscal year and 60 trips for $83,800 during the 2023 fiscal year.
Out-of-state travel is approved by the Legislature’s Executive Board. The Legislative Research Council maintains records of each approved request, including the destination, event name and cost.
Senate President Pro Tempore Chris Karr, R-Sioux Falls, said an increasing volume of work during the legislative offseason is likely driving down the number of out-of-state trips. The Legislature meets from January to March every year at the Capitol in Pierre, and some committees continue meeting the rest of the year — including special summer committees that study issues for potential future legislation.
This year, there are five summer study committees involving 52 total positions studying topics ranging from property taxes to incarceration rates, plus a Project Prison Reset task force appointed by the governor, involving legislators and non-legislators studying potential prison construction. In 2024, two summer study committees had a total of 26 positions, and in 2023, two committees had 28 positions.
“You can only allocate so much of your life to this,” Karr said. “Between the new prison and property tax task forces, and the various committee meetings, I think fewer lawmakers simply have the time.”
House Majority Leader Scott Odenbach, R-Spearfish, had a different take on what’s driving down the number of out-of-state trips. He said that “with conservative leadership, the members are behaving a bit more conservatively.” Republicans replaced their leadership team last fall after 14 incumbent Republican legislators lost in the June primary election.
Among the most frequented gatherings over the last three fiscal years were the National Conference of State Legislators summit (17 trips), the International Legislators Forum (16), and the Council of State Governments conference (15). The events are billed as bipartisan opportunities for lawmakers to share policy ideas and improve interstate cooperation. 
“The return on investment for the public is there,” Karr said. “You get to see how things are done in other states, and can bring that back. Better lawmakers make better laws.” 
The events are hosted in different states each year, ranging from Kentucky and Louisiana to Indiana and Hawaii. Two lawmakers who went on a Hawaii trip in December 2022 suffered criticism because they knew at the time that they would not be returning to office in 2023. Both of those lawmakers were back in the Legislature this year.    
Since the 2023 fiscal year, several Republican lawmakers attended events hosted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a conservative policy organization. Other ideologically themed events attended by South Dakota legislators included a Pro-Family Legislator Conference hosted by Wallbuilders, a group that supported recent failed legislation to require the Ten Commandments to be displayed and taught in South Dakota public schools, and the Statesmen Academy hosted by the Family Policy Alliance Foundation, which aims to “equip Christian leaders for impactful service.”
Those events are also hosted in a variety of states, ranging from Arizona and Colorado to Florida and Texas.

(Marvel Way Complex photo)A new sober living facility in Reno was selected as one of the first in the nation to receive federal funding for rooftop solar development under a Biden-era program that was nearly canceled by the Trump administration earlier this year.
The Empowerment Center – a nonprofit offering affordable housing for low income and at-risk women recovering from substance abuse – will receive more than $960,000 in “Solar for All” funding to install solar at their newly constructed multi-unit housing property.
Last year, Nevada was awarded a $156 million “Solar for All” grant by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to support rooftop or community solar projects that benefit low-income households. 
Nevada was one of several states cut off from the funding after President Donald Trump called for the immediate halt of energy grants, loans, and contracts funded through the Inflation Reduction Act passed under former president Joe Biden.
The Solar for All program was the only grant under the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund to survive the cull. In March EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the cancellation of the fund’s other two federal grants, eliminating $20 billion in renewable energy investment. 
With the survival of the program, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank that administers the “Solar for All” funds — selected the sober living facility as the first project to get the green-light.
“This first-of-its-kind project demonstrates how clean energy can help uplift people working hard to restore their lives,” said Kirsten Stasio, the CEO of the Nevada Clean Energy Fund.
Roxanne DeCarlo, the executive director of The Empowerment Center, said the solar installation will be vital to reducing utility costs and helping free up funds for addiction treatment, case management, and support staff. 
“When individuals arrive at our program, they are unemployed, homeless, or were recently incarcerated, so we’re really working with individuals that have a very low income. It’s really important that we keep our operations cost as low as possible,” DeCarlo said. 
Solar has already proven to be a significant cost-saving measure at the nonprofit’s two other affordable housing facilities, said DeCarlo. The organization hopes to power nearly all of the new building’s electricity needs with solar energy.
Nevada received the highest “Solar for All” funding per capita of any state. In fact, Nevada received the same award amount as Florida, Illinois, and Pennsylvania — states with significantly higher populations.
With robust funding, Nevada’s “Solar for All” program was expected to boost development of rooftop and community solar for low-income households that don’t have access to solar energy due to high upfront installation costs.
But the future of the program has also grown increasingly uncertain after Trump signed the “Big Beautiful Bill” into law, cutting the 30% Clean Electricity Investment Credit for solar projects that start construction after July 4, 2026 — phasing it out six years ahead of schedule. Projects will also need to be in service by the end of 2027 to receive the full credit. 
For residential solar, the 30% credit ends entirely at the end of 2025.
Greg Zegas, the managing director of investments at the Nevada Clean Energy Fund, said the early termination of tax credits pressures solar project developers to start construction before the end of the year. The deadline particularly impacts working families who rely on the tax credit to make solar affordable as electricity prices continue to climb.
“That’s a tax credit that is really beneficial for clean energy projects like solar,” Zegas said. “It basically means that any project that’s starting construction after 2025 is going to face additional hurdles for claiming the full value of the tax credit.”
In order to fill the funding gap left by the dissolution of those credits, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund may need to cover more solar installation costs in the state while funding less projects. 
“If we’re putting more money out towards grants, then it would reduce the amount of funding that we have for projects,” Zegas said. 
Despite a tight deadline and other challenges, Zegas said the Nevada Clean Energy Fund is optimistic they can get the $156 million allocated to Nevada “out the door to benefit households across the state.”
In the next few weeks, the Nevada Clean Energy Fund plans to finalize funding for several other “Solar for All” projects, said Zegas.
Those solar projects will benefit low-income and disadvantaged communities who rely on multifamily affordable housing projects, similar to the residents at The Empowerment Center. 
Community solar projects can be hosted by local governments, schools, businesses, or nonprofit that have a building, carport, or other land where solar can be placed.
“This program is really focused on benefiting low-income communities. Those populations face the highest utility bill burden proportionate to their income. That’s our goal with these projects, to reduce those energy costs and share those savings for households,” Zegas said.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Marvel-Exterior-1-635x425-1.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

BESSEMER — The school year was over, but classes were in session on a recent June morning at Jonesboro Elementary School in Bessemer. 
In one room, a small class of third graders practiced pronunciation and reading as they got ready to re-take the state’s standardized reading test. 
In the past few weeks, they have learned about construction. The students applied area formulas to determine how much tile they would need to cover a floor. The week before, the class held a contest — a gift card was the main prize — for who could make the best adaptation of the “Three Little Pigs” story using only materials they had.

“So each one, they pull a house from the pack and whatever you got, that’s what you built with,” fifth grade teacher Candace Wells said. “So we had a house full of straws, index cards and popsicle sticks. They had to use what they had to make it work.”
They also learned area formulas to determine how much material they would need to tile a floor. The class is part of Bessemer City Schools’ Fun Zone summer program to help prepare students for the next grade and teach them life skills, including balancing a budget. 
“Most of these kids have never seen a check before,” said Tieshia Collins, the Alabama Reading Initiative director at Bessemer City Schools and site leader for various summer programs at Jonesboro Elementary School. 
A group of first graders down the hallway was learning how to write the alphabet. Patrick Evans, their teacher, said that the state has provided additional resources that make it easier to teach students.
“I have an amazing team of teachers. The teachers work very well together,” Evans said. “I’ve seen these teachers work very hard. And so using that explicit instruction and that systematic instruction, especially in this small group environment, I think we’ve been making a lot of gains in the right direction.”
The resources were made available in part through the state. 
The Alabama State Department of Education took over Bessemer City Schools a year ago to address issues with leadership and finances. Both state and local officials say the intervention is helping with student achievement and training for teachers and administrators.
“We truly believe that professional development is going to be very, very important to help our school leaders, to help our teachers be successful in this district,” said Daniel Boyd, the state-appointed administrator for the Bessemer intervention, in an interview last month. “But in order to provide professional development it is important for us to determine where the deficits are at.”

Why the state intervened

Bessemer City Schools, located south of Birmingham, is considered an economically disadvantaged system. Under state funding weighted for student need, BCS receives 45% of its additional funding for students in poverty. According to its website, all 2,972 of BCS’s students receive free or reduced lunch. Of its students, 78.7% are Black and 16.2% are Hispanic.
The state cited the Bessemer City Schools Board of Education’s alleged dysfunction as a reason for intervention. According to a show cause letter sent to the board by State School Superintendent Eric Mackey on July 3, 2024, the Bessemer Board of Education canceled six meetings in the first six months of 2024 due to losing or lack of a quorum. 
“Serially canceling meetings or failing to meet a quorum arouses suspicion from which students, teachers, administrators and the community may infer an intentional lack of transparency and failure to address serious concerns such as manpower and critical maintenance operations,” Mackey wrote. 
According to the meeting minutes, there were 18 meetings in the time period. Twelve of those were called meetings. 
“Chaos is never good for schools and the Bessemer board meetings were chaotic. I don’t think there’s anybody that would question that,” Mackey said in an interview last month. 
Bessemer is one of three school systems the state has intervened in, and finances were an issue in each one. The state intervened in Sumter County Schools in western Alabama in 2023 mainly due to concerns about finances and personnel. The State Board of Education approved intervention in Dallas County Schools in the Black Belt in March because the system had leftover federal funds due to an ineffective processing system. 
In Bessemer’s case, the school failed to turn in its FY 2024 budget on time, according to Mackey.

“September 2022 was the last time that Bessemer City Schools submitted an on time budget to Alabama State Department of Education,” Boyd said in an interview last month. “Now, we did it this last go around. But the only reason why I feel that it was submitted on time was because of state intervention.”
Under the Intervention Act of 2013, the state superintendent decides whether or not the local board of education meets during intervention. Sumter and Dallas counties schools’ boards are still meeting regularly, but Mackey said Bessemer’s board could not work together to make decisions.
“I’ve put them on a hiatus because they were not functioning well,” Mackey said.
The board will undergo professional development and training until August, then resume regular meetings in September, Daniel Boyd said in an interview last month.
Mackey also listed “clearly dilapidated school facilities” as a reason for intervention. Reginald Mitchell, the maintenance director at BCS, said in an interview that some of the repairs the local board wanted in schools were cosmetic and did not fix the underlying issues of the 50+ year-old buildings.
“At the end of the day, you can put a pig on lipstick, but it’s still a pig,” Mitchell said. “Our buildings are so old in age, and we keep dumping money in them and it makes them look good. But what about our pipes and sewage lines and water lines?”
Mitchell said since intervention, the maintenance side of the school system is doing better than it ever has in his 20 years at BCS. 
“I’m just elated at the status here when it comes to my particular area with facilities and stuff trying to get stuff done,” Mitchell said. 
Mackey said that the productiveness of maintenance is simply due to the state approving projects, instead of the board. There are no additional funds for maintenance, he said.
“There were multiple times when the board would not act on recommendations of the superintendent, not act on the recommendations of their architects, not act on the recommendations of their attorney,” Mackey said. “It just didn’t act. You can’t move forward if somebody’s not making a decision in Bessemer.”

Student learning

In 2019, the state released a list of “failing schools” that included Bessemer City High School. Bessemer Board of Education member Margie Varner, an opponent of intervention, claimed that since only one of the system’s nine schools was on the list negates the claim of low student learning.
“I am not saying that I’m proud. I am simply saying that we are not at the bottom,” Varner said at a community meeting in June.
On the 2023-24 state report card, a collection of data that determines a school system’s success, Bessemer City Schools scored a 69 (D). Boyd said in an interview on June 23 that he expects Bessemer’s score to be a C when the 2024-25 report card is released this fall. 
“I don’t want it to be made official, but we feel pretty confident that the release of this report card will be the first C that this school district has ever made, which is huge,” Boyd said.
According to Alabama Comprehensive Assessment of Progress (ACAP) reading scores, BCS regressed in third graders that are at or above grade level. In 2024, 15.29% of BCS third graders scored below grade level, and in 2025, 31.87% scored below grade level. At least part of the reason may be a higher cutoff grade. The state this year raised the score that determines grade-level reading from 435 to 444. 
Students that scored below the cut score were studying at school last month to take the ACAP test again to prevent being held back. DeNitta Easterling, the principal coach and director of school leadership at Jonesboro Elementary, said the school collaborates with parents to make sure the students are successful.
“They get another chance,” she said. “There have been some identified deficits that these children have that may keep them from being on grade level.”
The school also hosts Camp Bessemer at Jonesboro Elementary. The program employs Bessemer high school students through the city to help teachers with summer programs. The students in summer school have a combination of learning academics and life skills.
“It’s a great introduction to the work force,” Collins said. 

New leadership and changes

(Andi Rice for Alabama Reflector)
Boyd was appointed chief administrative officer of the system by Mackey when the state intervened in August 2024. Boyd hired Michael Turner on April 1 to be the school’s new superintendent, who was the principal of Pinson Valley High School in Jefferson County for ten years. He said in an interview on June 23 that he plans to stay at BCS after the state withdraws.
“Why would we not believe that our kids, our investment, would deserve as good an education as the students at Mountain Brook, Vestavia, or any other OTM (Over the Mountain) school or wherever?” he said. “They deserve the absolute best quality of education.”
Boyd said that in order to set BCS up for success after intervention, board members and administrators are going through as much training and professional development as possible. 
“We’re trying our very best to train everyone to be as competent as they can be,” he said. “We truly believe that professional development is going to be very, very important to help our school leaders, to help our teachers be successful in this district.”
Turner said there are three “big rocks” to move the district forward: school board/superintendent relationship, personnel and operational procedures.
“If we can fix those three things, this school district, there’s no question in my mind, can excel, we’ll go past being a C,” Turner said.
The changes will take time, Boyd said, but the progress is good at this point.
“Engineers build bridges and build buildings,” Boyd said. “We’re offering a person to come here and build a person’s future. There’s no more rewarding work than doing that.”

(Photo: Getty Images)America has never been richer. But the gains are so lopsided that the top 10% controls 69% of all wealth in the country, while the bottom half controls just 3%. Meanwhile, surging corporate profits have mostly benefited investors, not the broader public.
This divide is expected to widen after President Donald Trump’s sweeping new spending bill drastically cuts Medicaid and food aid, programs that stabilize the economy and subsidize low-wage employers.
Moreover, the tax cuts at the heart of the bill will deliver tens of billions of dollars in benefits to the wealthiest households while disproportionately burdening low-income households, according to analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and Joint Committee on Taxation. By 2033, the bottom 20% will pay more in taxes while the top 0.1% receive $43 billion in cuts.
I am a sociologist who studies economic inequality, and my research demonstrates that the class-based inequalities exacerbated by the Trump bill are not new. Rather, they are part of a 50-year trend linked to social cleavages, political corruption and a declining belief in the common good.
 The roots of class-based inequality

The decades following World War II were broadly prosperous, but conditions began changing in the 1970s. Class inequality has increased enormously since then, according to government data, while income inequality has risen for five decades at the expense of workers.
Economists usually gauge a country’s economic health by looking at its gross domestic product as measured through total spending on everything from groceries to patents.
But another way to view GDP is by looking at whether the money goes to workers or business owners. This second method – the income approach – offers a clearer picture of who really benefits from economic growth.
The money that goes to labor’s share of GDP, or workers, is represented by employee compensation, including wages, salaries and benefits. The money left over for businesses after paying for work and materials is called gross operating surplus, or business surplus.
The share of GDP going to workers rose 12% from 1947 to 1970, then fell 14% between 1970 and 2023. The opposite happened with the business surplus, falling 18% in the early postwar decades before jumping 34% from 1970 to today.

Meanwhile, corporate profits have outpaced economic growth by 193% since 1970. Within profits, shareholder dividends as a share of GDP grew 274%.
As of 2023, labor had lost all of the economic gains made since 1947. Had workers kept their 1970 share of GDP, they would have earned $1.7 trillion more in 2023 alone. And no legislation or federal action since 1970 has reversed this half-century trend.
When more of the economy goes to businesses instead of workers, that poses serious social problems. My research focuses on three that threaten democracy.
 1. Fraying social bonds and livelihoods

Not just an issue of income and assets, growing class inequality represents the fraying of American society.
For instance, inequality and the resulting hardship are linked to worse health outcomes. Americans die younger than their peers in other rich countries, and U.S. life expectancy has decreased, especially among the poor.
Moreover, economic struggles contribute to mental health issues, deaths of despair and profound problems such as addiction, including tobacco, alcohol and opioid abuse.
Inequality can disrupt families. Kids who experience the stresses of poverty can develop neurological and emotional problems, putting them at risk for drug use as adults. On the other hand, when minimum wages increase and people begin saving wealth, divorce risk falls.
Research shows inequality has many other negative consequences, from reduced social mobility to lower social trust and even higher homicide rates.
Together, these broad social consequences are linked to misery, political discontent and normlessness.
 2. Increasing corruption in politics

Inequality is rising in the U.S. largely because business elites are exercising more influence over policy outcomes, research shows. My related work on privatization explains how 50 years of outsourcing public functions – through contracting, disinvestment and job cuts – threatens democratic accountability.
Research across different countries has repeatedly found that higher income inequality increases political corruption. It does so by undermining trust in government and institutions, and enabling elites to dominate policymaking while weakening public oversight.
Since 2010, weakened campaign finance laws driven by monied interests have sharply increased corruption risks. The Supreme Court ruled then in Citizens United to lift campaign finance restrictions, enabling unlimited political spending. It reached an apex in 2024, when Elon Musk spent $200 million to elect Trump before later installing his Starlink equipment onto Federal Aviation Administration systems in a reported takeover of a $2.4 billion contract with Verizon.
Research shows that a large majority of Americans believe that the economy is rigged, suggesting everyday people sense the link between inequality and corruption.
 3. Undermining belief in the common good

National aspirations have emphasized the common good since America’s founding. The Declaration of Independence lists the king’s first offense as undermining the “public good” by subverting the rule of law. The Constitution’s preamble commits the government to promoting the general welfare and shared well-being.
But higher inequality historically means the common good goes overlooked, according to research. Meanwhile, work has become more precarious, less unionized, more segmented and less geographically stable. Artificial intelligence may worsen these trends.
This tends to coincide with a drop in voting and other forms of civic engagement.
The government has fewer mechanisms for protecting community when rising inequality is paired with lower taxes for the wealthy and reduced public resources. My research finds that public sector unions especially bolster civic engagement in this environment.
Given increasing workplace and social isolation, America’s loneliness epidemic is unsurprising, especially for low earners.
All of these factors and their contribution to alienation can foster authoritarian beliefs and individualism. When people become cold and distrustful of one another, the notion of the common good collapses.
 Inequality as a policy outcome

News coverage of the Trump bill and policy debate have largely centered on immediate gains and losses. But zoomed out, a clearer picture emerges of the long-term dismantling of foundations that once supported broad economic security. That, in turn, has enabled democratic decline.
As labor’s share of the economy declined, so too did the institutional trust and shared social values that underpin democratic life. Among the many consequences are the political discontent and disillusionment shaping our current moment.
Republicans hold both chambers of Congress through 2026, making significant policy changes unlikely in the short term. Democrats opposed the bill but are out of power. And their coalition is divided between a centrist establishment and an insurgent progressive wing with diverging priorities in addressing inequality.
Yet democratic decline and inequality are not inevitable. If restoring broad prosperity and social stability are the goals, they may require revisiting the New Deal-style policies that produced labor’s peak economic share of 59% of GDP in 1970.

With additional state funds and reorganization of several programs, older New Mexicans, people with disabilities and caregivers now have support through the Aging and Long-Term Services Department’s reactivated Long-Term Care Division.
The Long-Term Care Division has long been part of the state’s aging department, but the division went dormant in Fiscal Year 2012 after community-based Medicaid waiver programs were moved from the division to the New Mexico Department of Health. Programs such as disability assistance and long-term living arrangements moved again last year to the Health Care Authority.
The aging department asked for additional state funds to renew the Long-Term Care Division during the most recent legislative session, and received just under $7 million through House Bill 2 to staff and operate the division. Joey Long, spokesperson for the ALTSD, told Source NM that $500,000 of the total appropriation was directed specifically to the Long-Term Care Division, while the rest was appropriated from existing department funding. Long said the reestablishment of the division is expected to “streamline care coordination,” particularly around community-based services.
“The [Long-Term Care Division] is going to be coordinating the care that helps us support people staying in their homes in their communities of choice. The division will be primarily focused on community and caregiver support resources, education and training,” Long told Source in an email.
According to a recent ALTSD news release, the division will now provide “coordinated and comprehensive” support to New Mexicans by overseeing programs including New MexiCare, the Veteran-Directed Care Program, the Office of Alzheimer’s and Dementia, Care Transitions and the Kinship Caregiver Pilot Program. 
New MexiCare provides financial assistance and caregiver training to qualifying New Mexicans throughout the state, except Bernalillo and Doña Ana counties — however, the department has previously told Source NM that the goal is to expand the program to encompass all counties. The Care Transition Program provides assistance and resources for people transitioning out of a long-term care facility and back into their own homes or other community setting. 
“The inclusion of this division marks a pivotal moment in how we deliver care to New Mexicans,” Aging and Long-Term Services Department Secretary Emily Kaltenbach said in a written statement. “By housing these vital programs under one focused division, we are ensuring that families, caregivers, and individuals living with complex needs have streamlined access to high-quality, person-centered care.”
According to the department’s news release, the Long-Term Care Division will also work to expand training opportunities and support for caregivers, enhance community-based services across the state, improve access to services in rural and tribal areas and oversee construction of “dementia-capable infrastructure.” 
According to Long, ALTSD Deputy Secretary Angelina Flores-Montoya will directly oversee the division.
“This is about building out a care system where no one falls through the cracks,” Flores-Montoya said in a written statement. “With the launch of this division, we’re not just reorganizing; we are deepening our commitment to serving the full continuum of long-term care needs in New Mexico.”",https://sourcenm.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lavendr_NMAS-Photo-Library-2025_0089-1-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

State Attorney General Dana Nessel is investigating the state’s quasi-public economic development agency in a larger probe of a $20 million state grant, administered by the MEDC, to a Southeast Michigan businesswoman who is a prominent figure in Democratic circles.
Senate Republican leader Aric Nesbitt (R-Porter Township) is calling for a federal investigation of the matter. Nesbitt is running for governor in next year’s election.
Fay Beydoun obtained the grant in 2022 to fund her newly created nonprofit company, Global Link International, formed (after the grant was awarded) to attract international business investment to Michigan. The Detroit News was first to report that Beydoun spent a portion of the money on a $4,500 coffeemaker, an $11,000 first-class plane ticket to Budapest and her annual salary of a whopping $550,000.
The grant was a budget appropriation approved by the then-Republican-controlled Legislature and Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. The MEDC, which oversaw the grant, cancelled it in March after the extravagant spending became public.SUBSCRIBE: GET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX
Investigators from Nessel’s office raided Beydoun’s Farmington Hills home and the MEDC’s offices on June 18. Nessel’s office complained the MEDC had been stonewalling its investigation, an allegation the MEDC denied. Beydoun has not been charged with a crime.
Although the MEDC did not fund the grant from one of its myriad business assistance programs—it was a direct legislative appropriation— the agency was charged with ensuring the $20 million in taxpayer funds was properly spent.
Nessel is seeking to learn more about how involved the MEDC was in pushing the legislative grant for Beydoun, Michigan Advance reported.
Beydoun was a member of the policy-setting MEDC executive committee at the time the grant was awarded. One email sent to the governor’s office by Beydoun said the MEDC approved of the payout to her company, Michigan Advance said.
The MEDC was created by then-Gov. John Engler in 1999 as a public-private partnership and at the time was considered a model for state economic development agencies. Putting the MEDC outside of direct state government control was designed to ensure continuity in economic development strategy regardless of which political party was in charge.
Its CEO doesn’t report directly to the governor like other state department heads, but to an 18-member executive committee. That’s led to less accountability to taxpayers and a long history of contentious relations with lawmakers, the media and other organizations seeking information about its workings.
The Mackinac Center for Public Policy, an often-influential free market proponent, has repeatedly called for the MEDC to be abolished.
Nevertheless, the agency has historically enjoyed strong bipartisan support for the billions of dollars it has spent to keep businesses from leaving the state and to attract new ones.
That was no more true than nearly four ago when lawmakers and Whitmer, caught flat-footed over Ford Motor Co.’s record $11.4 billion investment in electric vehicle and battery production in Tennessee and Kentucky, hastily created a $500 million pot to attract similar factories.
The Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund has since committed more than $1 billion to automakers and other clean-energy companies, according to the MEDC’s 2024 annual report.
But not a single job has yet been created from those awards.
That’s mostly due to project delays and pullbacks resulting from electric vehicle sales falling well below earlier projections.
Ford Motor Co. has scaled back job projections at its under-construction EV battery plant in Marshall from 2,350 jobs to 1,700 positions. The plant is expected to start production next year.
General Motors Co. has abandoned plans to convert its Orion Township assembly plant in Oakland County to build electric pickups and instead will build gas-powered trucks there.
GM earlier this year also completed the sale of its stake in a $1.5 billion Lansing battery plant nearing completion to its South Korean joint-venture partner, LG Energy Solution. A $120 million Critical Industry Program grant, part of the SOAR Fund, has been transferred to LG.
The move angered state House Speaker Matt Hall (R-Richland Township), who called it “a troubling pattern (by GM) of fleecing taxpayers and workers.”
Hall also has more broadly criticized the state’s business attraction incentives. He recently claimed the incentives are “not getting the results” and much of the money should be redirected to fixing the roads.
The MEDC’s Michigan Business Development Program, which was created in 2011 during the administration of then-Gov. Rick Snyder, has since its inception announced $290 million in grants and loans to businesses investing and creating jobs in the state.
Only about half of that has been dispersed because of the lack of job creation induced by the incentives.
Businesses committed to creating 28,811 jobs in exchange for the state’s financial support, but have added just 9,918 positions, according to the MEDC’s 2024 annual report. That’s only 2% of the 531,000 payroll jobs added in the state since 2011.
Democrats also have called for overhauling state business and talent attraction efforts.
In 2023, a coalition led by state Sen. Mallory McMorrow (R-Royal Oak) introduced a package of bills that would have shifted half of SOAR funding to community-based programs, including affordable housing, public transit and other investments. The bills failed to pass before the end of the legislation session last year.
But Nessel’s investigation into the MEDC’s role in the Beydoun grant scandal could finally force needed reforms at the agency to improve its effectiveness and its accountability to taxpayers.
It’s becoming more and more apparent that an economic development strategy focused on handing out cash to businesses to create jobs is woefully inadequate.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/IMG_8781-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

(File photo/Getty Images)Students attending South Carolina’s only historically Black technical college can learn to weld but on equipment that’s 70 years old. The school has talked of growing its cybersecurity degree program, but the computer systems it has for students to train on are far from the latest model.
Just how old they are is unknown — at least, to legislators who toured the school.
Yet when Denmark Technical College sought money to put toward a proposed new $35 million cybersecurity, energy and healthcare building, Senate budget writers refused to fund any of it. The House provided $2.3 million for the project in its state budget proposal. But the final version of the budget that took effect July 1 gave zero.
“If the state won’t fund it, how are you going to grow the program,” Rep. Justin Bamberg, D-Bamberg, told the SC Daily Gazette. “No one is going to pay money to go to a tech school that has old technology. In today’s day and age, nobody wants to go to a run-down college.”
New tech school investments to address increased enrollment, AI skills in manufacturing

It’s the second year in a row that the small tech school, located in sparsely populated Bamberg County along South Carolina’s rural southwestern border, has had its requests yanked from the budget as it battles ongoing financial problems.
Senate Minority Leader Brad Hutto called it “a shot across the bow” from some Senate GOP leaders that Denmark Tech administrators need to balance the struggling school’s budget and boost enrollment.
The college developed a budget stabilization plan, as requested by the Legislature, but it wasn’t considered practical, Hutto said. “That was one of the frustrations,” he said.
The Orangeburg Democrat, along with others who represent or advocate for the state’s historically Black colleges and universities, acknowledge the college’s past leadership issues and failure to get in front of financial shortfalls. However, they question how their fellow legislators can expect the school to meet their goals if the funds for big-dollar projects needed to enter the 21st century are continuously denied.
In turn, the only option the school is left with are deeper cuts and nothing to attract the greater number of students it would need to raise revenues.
“That’s an abomination,” said Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, who sits on the House higher education budget panel.
“I don’t recall us doing that to other tech schools,” the Orangeburg Democrat added.
The school has not had a new technical building since 1961, and it hasn’t had a new academic building since 1975. Meanwhile legislators funneled $140 million for projects and maintenance at 14 of South Carolina’s other technical colleges in the current budget. Two rural schools — Denmark Tech and Northeastern Tech based in Cheraw — were left out.
Denmark Tech administrators did not grant multiple requests over several weeks from the SC Daily Gazette for an interview.

Financial turmoil
Denmark Tech’s troubles at the top began in 2009, when then-President John Waddell was suspended without pay after an audit found some unnamed “administrative irregularities,” The Associated Press reported.
The college then went through a series of interim and short-term leadership, with none remaining in charge for more than three years. In 2017, the Legislature voted unanimously to temporarily put the state Technical College System in control of the school in dire financial straits.
The student body had fallen from about 2,000 full- and part-time students in fall 2012 to just 600 students four years later ahead of the tech system taking over, according to data from the state’s higher education agency. All tech school enrollment was on the decline at this time, though none as precipitous as Denmark Tech. And while numbers plummeted, little was done to cut expenses or workforce to match needs.
Over that same four-year period, the school’s cash on hand sank to about $285,000 from just over $9 million, The Associated Press reported.
In 2019, House budget writers recommended converting Denmark Tech to a trade school, offering industry certificates for flight training and skilled jobs in construction. Proponents saw the mission change as a way to keep the doors open. But advocates of the school protested, and legislators scrapped the idea.
Later that year, the tech college system found itself shuffling around $2 million from the pool of money it doles out to its 16 schools, taking a portion from the others to make up for Denmark Tech’s shortfall. System leaders discovered further issues, including misspending of $500,000 the state budget provided the school in 2018 to buy equipment that it instead used to cover payroll.
When Denmark Tech’s most recent president, Willie Todd Jr., stepped to the helm in January 2020, legislators tasked him to come up with a plan to turn around the cash-strapped school as they debated its future.
Three months later, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, sending colleges nationwide into a financial tailspin.
‘Begging for crumbs’
Cobb-Hunter was among legislators pushing for the conversion of Denmark Tech to a trade school. But she said her viewpoint has since evolved, largely thanks to Todd’s leadership.
“I think they proved themselves,” Cobb-Hunter said. “But leadership without resources can only do so much. It’s hard to grow when you’re constantly begging for crumbs.”
Todd’s last day at the school was June 30 as he left to become president of Talladega College in Alabama.
Today, enrollment hovers around 700 students and Denmark Tech employs about 50 people. In the college’s latest financial report, expenses outpaced revenue by $1 million. All of this falls against a backdrop of declining college enrollment nationwide and a so-called “enrollment cliff” after decades of declining birthrates mean a smaller pool of potential students.

Last year, legislators agreed to let the school use $2.2 million in maintenance funds for operations but denied it $2.4 million in the budget for renovating a pair of buildings on campus. The shift in funds also came with the stipulation that the college develop a budget stabilization plan and a reduction of employees.
Legislators representing the college say looking at the numbers on the balance sheet doesn’t tell the whole story about the technical college that’s been chronically underfunded almost since its beginning.
Historic factors
A 1947 state law created Denmark Tech as a trade school for Black South Carolinians, and it opened a year later. The school became part of the statewide technical college system in 1969, eight years after that system’s creation, as the school for students in Allendale, Bamberg and Barnwell counties.
But according to Hutto, as the state was still struggling against national desegregation mandates, Denmark Tech was not provided funding from the state at the same level other tech schools in the system were.
“It’s easy for people to say today you should be doing great now,” Bamberg said of the racial history surrounding the college. “But it doesn’t change the reality that, for so long, some people were purposefully screwed by and left out of the system. People seem to forget that, for some people, the starting line was 100 miles behind everyone else.”
Furthermore, Denmark Tech covers South Carolina’s three smallest counties, with high schools educating only about 400 seniors total, according to state education department data. Many of these students come from poor families, putting them more at risk and requiring extra aid to graduate.
And there is little industry in the tri-county region where students can get a job after graduating. The lack of an industrial tax base has put the cost of K-12 school construction on residents through high property taxes.
All these factors compound to impact Denmark Tech and the region’s residents, Bamberg said.
Finally, technical colleges are designed to educate students closer to home. If the school were to close, students from area high schools would have to travel farther than their peers for a technical education.
Many already do. They drive to Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College, about 30 miles from the Denmark campus, or to Aiken Technical College, which is also about 30 miles from parts of Barnwell County. Other alternatives include the University of South Carolina satellite campus in Allendale.
Advocates argue more students would enroll at Denmark Tech if the facilities were up to date.
“Legislators can’t just keep saying, ‘Oh, poor Denmark Tech’ and not own up to our responsibility in how we got here,” Cobb-Hunter said.
“I hear the governor and everyone talk about South Carolina being in the best financial condition it’s ever been,” Bamberg added. “But we have a state technical college that has old buildings that were around when peoples’ grandparents attended. It’s so frustrating.”
It remains to be seen whether prior recommendations will resurface. Back in 2019, the state technical system suggested turning Denmark Tech into a satellite campus of Orangeburg-Calhoun Technical College.
Sen. Ronnie Cromer, who chairs the Senate’s higher education budget panel, said both the technical college and South Carolina State University in Orangeburg — the state’s only public historically Black university — are in need of upgrades of their own. They’re where many of the region’s students are choosing to attend already, and they’re outperforming Denmark Tech, he said.
“It siphons off money that can be put to good use,” the Newberry County Republican said of bolstering Denmark Tech. “Those that have proven themselves and are educating our children to the best of their ability, they are the ones that really deserve to be funded properly.”",https://scdailygazette.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/graduates-1-1024x683.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 09:09:35.732387

That’s not the case in our prisons. The Alabama Department of Corrections last fall reported a 13% increase in fights in its facilities as well as an increase in inmate-on-staff assaults. DOC has also shelled out millions of dollars to settle lawsuits alleging excessive force by corrections officers on inmates. And all of this comes amid a years-long federal lawsuit over physical and sexual assaults in Alabama prisons.
Knowing all this, hope seems trivial, even something to scoff at. Most politicians think public safety is sidearms and snappy uniforms, not allowing people to see a better future. But if the incarcerated don’t have something to live for or work toward during their time in prison, violence becomes a lot more tempting and rehabilitation programs become far less appealing.
“What reason do they have to go (to rehab programs) as long as they’ll be denied for parole?” Kenneth Traywick, an inmate in the state prison system, told my colleague Melissa Brown in 2021. “They know this. Nobody is wanting to do any of that because they know good and well it’s not going to help them in the long run.”
As chair of the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles, Leigh Gwathney did all she could to destroy hope among the state’s incarcerated population.
During Gwathney’s time on the board, which ended last week, the parole grant rate, which stood at 54% in 2017, plummeted to 8% in 2023. It’s rebounded in recent years, but in many cases, the board ignored parole guidelines when they said applicants should be released from prison.
This was done in the name of law and order, or at least a 1987 version of it. Gov. Kay Ivey, who got new powers over the state pardons and paroles process in 2018, first paired Gwathney with Charlie Graddick, a former Alabama attorney general and judge who embodied a Reagan-era approach to law enforcement. Ivey said in a statement at the time of Gwathney’s appointment that she expected them to “ultimately, improve public safety across the state.”
Six years later, it’s hard to see any effect that approach had on public safety. By most measures, Alabama’s crime rates in 2019 were up from historic lows in the middle part of the decade but not even close to records set in the early 1990s. A pandemic-era surge in crime the next year — coming as the board was squeezing parole rates — was sharp but short.  Crime rates were effectively flat in the state in 2022 and 2023, according to the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency. Birmingham and Montgomery, hit hard by gun violence, have seen homicide levels drop this year.
But Alabama prisons never stopped being violent or dangerous in those six years. And the board kept many people locked in there, even those who had worked in good faith to reform and cut time off their sentences.
The parole board didn’t create the crisis in the state’s correctional facilities. But they embodied state officials’ effective indifference to it. By telling inmates they could never take steps to shorten a sentence, they took away incentives for order behind bars. For keeping prisons safe.
And for a while, most of the people responsible shrugged.
But not all. Even before parole rates hit their all-time low, Graddick faced sharp questions from Democratic and Republican legislators about the declining parole rates. He stepped down from the job at the end of 2020.
Gwathney held on. The end only came after a disastrous appearance before lawmakers last October, where she struggled to answer questions about the board’s parole rates and its responsiveness to legislators’ inquiries. (A tip for all state officials: Do not make the people who set your budget wait months for their requests.)
Can things get better? We’ll see. Graddick’s old job has been held for years by Cam Ward, who spent much of his time in the Legislature trying to fix the prison crisis and has worked to provide rehabilitation and training services to those in his purview.
Hal Nash, Ivey’s pick to succeed Gwathney, is also talking about putting public safety first. But he also acknowledged that people can change for the better, an idea that seemed foreign to Gwathney and many of her colleagues on the board.
I hope Nash understands that “public safety” and “inmate rehabilitation” are not ideas in conflict with each other. They are tied together. And keeping the hope out of prisons will mean extending the violence and a lot less security for all of us.",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Parole_Board_002-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

He told the board that the impact of President Donald Trump's reconciliation bill was not as large on community colleges as expected, but to still move forward with caution. (Anna Barrett/Alabama Reflector)The chancellor of the Alabama Community College System said Wednesday he is more optimistic about the impact of President Donald Trump’s reconciliation bill after changes were made to the legislation during the process. 
“I think the update is a much better dose compared to what we thought it might be in the beginning,” Chancellor Jimmy Baker said at the board’s meeting Wednesday.
At the June board meeting, Baker expressed concerns about the implications of the reconciliation bill, especially in regards to federal Pell Grants and the eligibility requirements for it. 
The Pell Grant is given to students based on their expected family contribution, among other academic factors, and often goes to students with “exceptional financial need,” according to the Federal Student Aid Office. According to ACCS, its students receive an average of $4,300 in Pell Grants every year, about $500 less than the median ACCS yearly tuition.
The first version of the bill included changing the definition of a full time student to be a student enrolled in 15 credit hours, up from 12 credit hours. The final version did not include that change. 
“That certainly would have had major implications on our students,” said Boone Kinard, the executive director of external affairs for ACCS. “Again, those were not included in the final version of the bill, and we are very happy that they were not.”
The changes on federal student aid that did make the final version of the bill will not impact community colleges, Kinard said. However, he said there are some additional accountability measures for community college students that do receive federal aid.
“Now the earnings of students who have gone through programs will be tracked on the federal level and will be looked at a lot more closely moving forward than they have been in the past,” he said. “Certainly, we want to see what the guidelines are on that.”
Although Kinard said community colleges were not impacted as much as expected by the bill, there may still be threats to federal funding for the next fiscal year. 
“President Trump has proposed some cuts, and that will be through the congressional appropriations process, which is a completely different process from what they’ve just done,” he said. “There’s a lot of unknown at this point of how all that’s going to play out.”
Moving forward, Kinard told the board members that they should be prepared for federal funding cuts and expect money to be used differently.
“Our expectation is not as bad as it looked like six weeks ago or four weeks ago, but that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t be cautious,” Baker said. “I do think the odds of continuing funding at the current level down the road is not going to be a good chance.”",https://alabamareflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_9642-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

Ford,,,,,https://marylandmatters.org/2025/07/14/maryland-churches-could-openly-endorse-candidates-from-the-pulpit-under-irs-proposal/,"A recent court filing by the IRS could allow churches and other houses of worship to endorse political candidates from the pulpit without endangering their nonprofit status, a reversal from decades of policy.","Churches could make political endorsements without fear of losing their nonprofit status, if a recent IRS settlement agreement is approved by a federal judge in Texas in a lawsuit brought by churches. (Photo by Capt. Joe Bush/U.S. Army)The Rev. L.K. Floyd believes church leaders should have the liberty to speak to their congregations and support certain political candidates, especially when it comes to improving their communities.
Floyd, pastor at Heart Changers Baptist Church in Silver Spring, said Friday some people may believe that allowing that only helps evangelical Christians, pointing to white evangelicals like the late Rev. Jerry Falwell Sr. who established the Moral Majority in 1979 as a political organization pushing a “pro-family” agenda.
“Not allowing the Black church, in particular, to be able to speak from the pulpit their political views, and also to be able to endorse their candidates and focus and support their agendas, I believe would be dangerous and problematic,” Floyd said. “When there is something that is unjust … we must speak truth to power.”
Now, the Internal Revenue Service agrees.
In a proposed settlement filed last week, the IRS agreed with the National Religious Broadcasters that churches and other houses of worship should be allowed to formally endorse political candidate without endangering their nonprofit status under the tax code.
A U.S. District Court judge in Texas still has to approve the agreement, which would settle a lawsuit by two Texas churches, the Intercessors for America and the National Religious Broadcasters that challenged the “Johnson Amendment” to the Internal Revenue Code. That 1954 amendment was introduced by then-Texas Sen. Lyndon B. Johnson, and said that nonprofit organizations can maintain tax exempt status if they refrain from political campaigning.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
There’s no specific deadline for the judge to make a decision. A lawyer with the IRS didn’t respond to an email for comment. A lawyer for the plaintiffs declined to comment Thursday.
The seven-page court filing states the amendment violates the plaintiffs’ First and Fifth Amendment rights to freedom of speech and free exercise of religion, as well as their rights to equal protection under the law. It said merely speaking from the pulpit does not violate the Johnson Amendment rule against participating in or intervening in a political campaign.
“Bona fide communications internal to a house of worship, between the house of worship and its congregation, in connection with religious services, do neither of those things, any more than does a family discussion concerning candidates,” the proposed settlement says.
“Thus, communications from a house of worship to its congregation in connection with religious services through its usual channels of communication on matters of faith do not run afoul of the Johnson Amendment as properly interpreted,” it says.
The settlement also acknowledged the IRS “has not enforced the Johnson Amendment against houses of worship for speech concerning electoral politics in the context of worship services.”
‘A green light’
University of Notre Dame law Professor Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer said in an interview Thursday that the IRS hasn’t been enforcing the so-called Johnson amendment for at least the past 20 years.
“Many religious leaders have become bolder and bolder in inviting candidates to come speak at their church, calling them up to get praised, or saying other things that clearly indicate support of a candidate and not have the IRS open up an audit or threaten their types of status as a result,” said Hitoshi Mayer, whose areas of research include election and tax law and political activity by churches and other religious organizations.
“It gives churches that perhaps were hesitant to engage in this activity because they were worried about the IRS a green light to do so,” he said.
Even if the judge decides not to approve the settlement, and asks both parties to go back and try again, Hitoshi Mayer said the IRS acknowledges “we are not going to enforce the Johnson amendment” against churches and other houses of worship. At least it wouldn’t happen during the Trump administration, he said, because President Donald Trump (R) said during his first term in office he wanted to repeal the amendment.

On Wednesday during a lunch with African leaders, Trump said, “I love the fact that churches can endorse a political candidate. If somebody of faith wants to endorse, I think it’s something that I’d like to hear. Those people were not allowed to speak up. Now they’re allowed to speak up. I think it’s terrific.”
Separation of church and state, or not
Jeff Trimbath, president of the nonprofit Maryland Family Institute, called the IRS court filing “a watershed moment.”
“For too long, many pastors have operated under the chilling belief that the law prevented them from equipping their congregations on how to think biblically about civic engagement, candidates, and public policy,” Trimbath said in a statement Tuesday. “The IRS made it clear: there is no such prohibition. Let’s pray this leads to pulpits that are once again unafraid to preach the whole counsel of God — including His truth for the public square.”
Not all religious groups are on board. Ashley Hildebrand, senior adviser with Catholics for Choice based in Washington, D.C., hopes the judge rejects the settlement, especially given what it could mean for the separation of church and state.
“If the church can endorse a political candidate, it is just one more way that priests could preach from the pulpit and further alienate people in the pews,” Hildebrand said Thursday.
“If we allow the pulpit to be weaponized or put into service of a political agenda more so than it already is, we are essentially allowing a very well-organized religious force to mobilize its base in pursuit of a partisan agenda,” she said. “That is inherently dangerous.”
No matter what the judge decides, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said it plans to maintain its stance of not endorsing or opposing political candidates.
“The IRS was addressing a specific case, and it doesn’t change how the Catholic Church engages in public debate,” the conference’s spokesperson Chieko Noguchi said in a statement Tuesday. “The Church seeks to help Catholics form their conscience in the Gospel so they might discern which candidates and policies would advance the common good.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/2632341-cropped-e1752492036207-1024x704.jpg,,,2025-07-14 08:11:23.352418

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-14 11:30:00+00:00,CT Mirror,What are the new AI laws in Connecticut?,Angela Eichhorst,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/14/ct-ai-laws-session/,"CT didn't regulate AI for businesses, but it did criminalize deepfake revenge porn and provide education funding for artificial intelligence.","For the second year in a row, Connecticut legislators decided not to regulate AI for businesses, but they did pass a law that criminalizes deepfake revenge porn and provides education funding for artificial intelligence. 
A bill that would have required companies to publicly disclose their AI use was passed by the Senate but was not taken up by the House after Gov. Ned Lamont threatened to veto the measure. He expressed concern that it would damage Connecticut’s technology sector. 
Here’s what to know about this session’s AI bills, their status and how they compare to other states’ laws.
What AI bills became law this year?
Most of the AI legislation signed into law this session came in the budget bill, which authorized $500,000 for the Connecticut Online AI academy, $25,000 for AI training at the Boys and Girls Club of Milford and $75,000 for three Boys and Girls Clubs’ AI training pilots in the state. 
It also made disseminating “synthetically created” revenge porn a crime as of Oct. 1, 2025. The law does not directly mention AI-created images, but lawmakers are aiming to address the problem of generative-AI revenge porn deepfakes. The law could also apply to other image creation techniques. It criminalizes the sharing of such images without the depicted person’s consent.
And new privacy legislation in Senate Bill 1295 requires collectors of sensitive data to notify consumers if their personal data is being used to train large language models.
It also gives consumers the right to opt out of automated systems, which could include AI, to prevent them from using their personal data to make significant decisions regarding housing, insurance, health care, education, criminal justice and employment. It gives consumers the right to question decisions made with automated decision systems, and if it relates to housing, to correct any inaccurate information before the decision is reevaluated. 
What didn’t pass? 
Senate Bill 2, a measure that would have required companies to publicly disclose AI use to consumers, passed the Senate but was not brought up for a vote in the House by the end of the session. Last-minute amendments watered down initial requirements to produce annual impact assessments and mitigate algorithmic discrimination in an attempt to make the bill more palatable to the governor.
This is the second year such AI business regulation has made it through the Senate, and just like last year, House Speaker Matt Ritter, D-Hartford, declined to call it to the House floor after Lamont threatened to veto it.
Another piece of legislation, Senate Bill 1484, which sought to prevent algorithmic discrimination against employees and require disclosure of AI’s role in employee assessment, was passed by the Judiciary Committee but went no further in the legislative process. 
Why did Lamont threaten to veto S.B. 2? 
This is the third year Sen. James Maroney, D-Milford, has authored a bill on AI. The first one, which required the disclosure of AI use by the Connecticut government, sailed through the Senate and House before being signed into law in 2023 by Lamont. 
While Maroney got key senate leaders, Senate President Pro Tem Martin M. Looney,  D-New Haven, and Senate Majority Leader Bob Duff, D-Norwalk, on board for S.B. 2, though, he failed to convince Lamont. 
The governor has dissuaded legislators from passing AI regulation that he thinks could risk scaring business away from Connecticut. 
“The governor remains concerned that this is a fast-moving space and that we need to make sure we do this right and don’t stymie innovation,” Lamont’s office said in 2024 about a similar bill.
This year, Lamont’s chief innovation officer Dan O’Keefe said S.B. 2 would send “a message that says, ‘Because we don’t understand this yet, you can’t innovate here. You can’t take risks here.’”
O’Keefe also expressed concern that passing such legislation in Connecticut was “too early” and that a state with 1% of the U.S. population should not be among the first few in the country to pass AI regulation. 
Sens. John Kissel, R-Enfield, Paul Cicarella, R-North Haven, and Melissa Osborne, D-Simsbury, who spoke in opposition to the bill when it came up for its vote in the Judiciary Committee, echoed O’Keefe’s concerns. Kissel also brought up the Trump administration’s support for AI technology as a reason to not pass a regulatory bill now. 
What are AI laws in other states? 
Several states have passed AI legislation in the last couple of years. Colorado became the first state to require that companies disclose their artificial intelligence systems and to codify discrimination by AI of protected groups as illegal in 2024, similar to the goals of Connecticut’s S.B. 2. 
Utah passed legislation in 2024 that requires proactive disclosure of AI use in regulated occupations. California and Texas have also passed private-sector regulatory laws.  
Connecticut joins New Jersey, New Hampshire, Massachusetts and others in criminalizing deepfake revenge porn. New Hampshire law even goes a step further to prohibit deepfakes of any kind that cause reputational harm, including deepfakes of political candidates. 
States have had various aspects of AI legislation introduced, but it has failed to pass at different points in the system. A law with goals similar to Connecticut’s S.B. 2 passed in Virginia but was vetoed by Gov. Glenn Youngkin. 
What about federal AI law? 
Trump signed the Take It Down Act in May, which criminalizes deepfake porn federally.
The federal budget reconciliation bill, also known as the ‘big beautiful bill’ that passed earlier this month, initially contained a Trump-backed ban on states enforcing and enacting any AI laws for 10 years. Hours before the bill passed, senators voted 99-1 to remove the ban language from the bill. 
It remains up to the states to chart their own course.   
How did CT Mirror use AI this session? 
CT Mirror used AI to analyze the text of bills, create transcriptions of hearings and sessions when a transcript was not readily available and search for relevant quotes within bill and transcript text. We used AI to search for explicit language in a 9-hour video, enabling us to publish our piece within the course of an afternoon. CT Mirror checked quotes against original documents and confirmed claims with secondary sources.

Read the story on VTDigger here:  Nicole Miller: The freeze of federal funding for after-school programs and its impact in Vermont.","This commentary is by Nicole Miller of Burlington. She is executive director of Vermont Afterschool, a statewide nonprofit dedicated to ensuring that children and youth in every Vermont community are able to benefit from the power of after-school.


Recent news of the Trump administration withholding $6.8 billion in FY25 federal education funding, including $1.4 billion intended for before- and after-school programs through Title IV Part B, the “21st Century Community Learning Centers” program, is unacceptable.
Communities across Vermont know that after-school and summer programs are providing invaluable learning opportunities for young people — keeping them safe, inspiring them to learn and grow, and giving working families peace of mind. It raises concerns about the potential ripple effects on student learning, family stability and community engagement.
Congress appropriated, and all 50 states and D.C. have already committed these funds to individual after-school and summer learning programs, most of which are expecting their grants now. By holding back these funds, the administration is disregarding the needs of students and families at a crucial time of the year, the ramifications of which will be felt for years to come.
In Vermont, the impact of not receiving these funds will be felt deeply. Ninety-four individual after-school and summer program locations throughout the state, serving 11,000 youth, are currently supported by the 21st CCLC funding.
After-school programs play a vital role in the learning ecosystem for millions of children across the United States. According to the “America After 3PM” report from the Afterschool Alliance, 24.7 million children would participate in an after-school program if one were available to them. This demand far outpaces supply, leaving nearly one-in-two families struggling to access opportunities that support academic achievement, social development, and family economic stability.
In Vermont, more than 26,000 children and youth would be enrolled in a program if one were available, and nationally, 91% of registered voters overall agree that after-school programs provide parents with peace of mind. 
Nationally, registered voters report overwhelmingly positive attitudes toward these programs:
●     89% say after-school helps children learn life skills.
●     89% say it prevents risky behaviors and exposure to negative influences in-person and online
●     90% say it helps children catch up academically and socially.
After-school programs often go beyond academics. Many offer meals, physical activity, mentoring, STEM exploration and safe environments during peak hours for juvenile crime and risky behavior. In fact, juvenile crime peaks between 3 and 6 p.m. — the same hours after-school programs operate.
Access to these programs is uneven, especially in rural areas, tribal communities, and among low-income families. The “America After 3PM” report notes that children from low-income households are more likely to attend a program where staff help with homework, provide healthy snacks, and offer enrichment activities — but are also more likely to lose access when funding is unstable.
While this funding pause may be temporary, the implications are significant. It introduces uncertainty for schools and community organizations that plan and staff these programs months in advance. More importantly, it adds to the structural challenges that have long affected availability and affordability of quality after-school options.
As the conversation around federal education budgets continues, it is important to understand the role of after-school programs in supporting the whole child and the whole community. These programs represent more than enrichment — they represent opportunity, safety and connection for millions of families nationwide.

Are our ridgelines doomed to be eclipsed by counterfeit canopies?
Read the story on VTDigger here:  Judith D. Schwartz: The vining of New England.","This commentary is by Judith D. Schwartz of Bennington. She is the author of three books that explore global challenges through the lens of nature, including “Cows Save the Planet: and Other Improbable Ways of Restoring Soil to Heal the Earth.”


One day I walked down the hill and glanced at the trees — the stately canopy at our property’s edge. Then I took a closer look: what I thought were crowns of maple, oak and shagbark hickory was in fact a shroud of vines, likely the Asiatic bittersweet that’s been shimmying up every trunk and limb in sight. 
Our land in southwestern Vermont is far from unique in being overrun by vines masquerading as treetops. Consider kudzu, known as “the vine that ate the South.”
And now, throughout New England, you’ll see trees bent and weakened by the advancing vegetation, now little more than scaffolding for leafy vines. In western Massachusetts, the Kennedy and Burbank parks contend with the “kiwi apocalypse,” as hardy kiwi — originally introduced by garden clubs and favored by Gilded Era elite — smothers native trees, while Sudbury’s Asiatic bittersweet problem is such that groups have instituted “bittersweet removal days.” An out-of-control invasive vine scenario is often referred to as an “infestation.” 
Troublesome vines like Asiatic bittersweet, kiwi, porcelain-berry, wisteria and, yes, kudzu, are generally dispersed by wildlife that eat the fruit. They are persistent: emerging from seeds, sprouting from roots, sending shoots or runners from cut stems. With fast-growing vines draped across our woodlands, our beloved broadleafs have to struggle for air and sunlight. 
When it comes to unwanted plants, my go-to is Mike Bald, whose Royalton company “Got Weeds?” manages invasives without chemicals. Mike does have a grudging respect for vines, and recognizes they do play an ecological role — at least when systems are in balance.
“Vines are nature’s rehab species,” he says. “They cover bare ground, stabilize temperatures, and allow recovery from disturbance to begin.” The invasion of invasive vines, then, can be seen in part as a symptom of the damage our forests, meadows and riparian areas have sustained. 
He also attributes this shift toward vines to conditions that increasingly favor climbers and creepers. He notes a study from 2006 that found poison ivy — a vine that’s native, if not beloved — grows more rigorously amid warmer temperatures and increased CO2.
While many trees suffer under weather extremes, he says vines seem unbothered by drought or wet conditions. One reason hardy kiwi flourishes in our part of the world is that it can withstand below-zero temperatures. Asiatic bittersweet’s trick is that it thrives in sun or shade, forest or city lot, is fire-resilient, and can be spread both by birds and via underground roots. This canny plant has it all covered — and not only the unwitting trees.
Are our ridgelines doomed to be eclipsed by counterfeit canopies? We can start being proactive by becoming aware of them. One challenge is that these plants drift in slowly so that you don’t notice until they’re wreaking havoc — just like I was caught unawares by what I’d initially thought were treetops. At first glimpse you assume that it’s green so it must be fine.
It’s important to bring fresh eyes to the scene. Then you can acquaint yourself with the specific vines. Once familiar with the plants, you’re more likely to catch them early, before they’re established or setting fruit, while it’s still easy to pull them out by hand. Let them dry in the sun and then dispose of them safely.
For large vines that are rooted in, get them out of the canopy to keep them grounded. Mike says to cut them at the base and flag them so you can do repeat cuttings to eradicate the vines. (Eventually the plant will exhaust its reserves.)
This way, birds — those vectors of aggressive seeds — won’t have access to the berries. And watch for seedlings, which you can yank out before they get their hold on a tree.
We should also be prepared for what’s ahead. On his travels through the region Mike has seen signs that more troublesome climbers are coming our way. “Up and down the Hudson River you can see vast stretches of non-native greenery,” he says. “River corridors, rail lines and roadways are the fingers poking northward into the heart of New England.” It’s worth knowing that kudzu has come up as far north as Massachusetts.
Mike recently came by and I showed him the faux treeline. What struck him was the hole in the forest canopy, a 100-feet in diameter circle where the trees had collapsed inward. The vines were still there, sending tendrils to the next row of trees. He had just been in the Berkshires and said this was the exact pattern he observed in Massachusetts, including in Lenox’s Kennedy Park, where the kiwi reigns.
It’s on us to keep our eye on the vines. Our local trees are worth it.

Does your heart fill with mean-spirited joy at the thought of human beings stuffed into tents and FEMA trailers parked on a disused airstrip in the heart of the Everglades in the middle of a Florida summer?
Do you get off on the idea of alligators and snakes killing people and admire bully capitalism hawking camo beverage coolers, stickers, and T-shirts with grinning reptiles proclaiming, “Nowhere to Run; Nowhere to Hide”?
Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier certainly does: He’s raising campaign cash on his own little merch site.
Other paid-up members of the Cruelty is the Point cult do, too.
Celebrating the erection of Florida’s own gulag, known as “Alligator Alcatraz,” the state Republican Party bosses trilled, “Don’t forget to pick up your swag to support our efforts to undo all of Joe Biden’s failures!”
We are ruled by sociopaths.
This prison, parked in the middle of Big Cypress National Preserve, has already received hundreds of detainees, packed into rough-and-ready structures that have not had to meet any building or environmental codes and may not be able to withstand a tropical storm.
Cult leaders can’t decide if the place is Devil’s Island or a charmingly rustic resort.
Showing Donald Trump around the place, Ron DeSantis pointed to the razor wire, iron bunk beds, and bright new Astroturf on the ground.
The first batch of detainees don’t seem especially grateful. Those who’ve managed to make a phone call to the outside world say the guards have served them maggot-laced food, refused them medical attention, kept bright lights on all night, and either crank up the air conditioning until the detainees freeze or cut it off and let them swelter.
One alleged foreign malefactor says guards confiscated his Bible.
  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security posted this illustration on its X page, with the caption, “Coming soon!.” (Via @DHS.gov)
 Gators in ICE caps
Trump loves this. He fantasizes about terrified detainees chased by Burmese pythons and “cops that are in the form of alligators.”
The White House has put out a Trump meme with a gaggle of gators in ICE caps.
The Trump administration is proud of this latest monument to hatred and gets very upset if anyone criticizes it.
Stephen Miller, architect of Trump’s immigration policy, flew into a tantrum the other day when a reporter told him inhabitants of the human world were calling the South Florida stalag “dehumanizing.”
“American citizens are stripped of their rights and their liberties by the invasion of illegal aliens!” he replied. “What’s ‘dehumanizing’ is when Democrats let illegal alien rapists into the country to attack our children. That is ‘dehumanizing’!”
He failed to explain exactly how people fleeing murderous dictatorships in Venezuela, El Salvador, and Nicaragua take rights and liberties from citizens.
As for those hideous assaults alleged by Miller, American citizens commit far more crimes than undocumented immigrants.
The administration knows this. Until a few weeks ago, a Department of Justice website contained information confirming it.
Attorney General Pam Bondi shut down the website for “review” in “accordance with recent Executive Orders and related guidance.”
Why let data get in the way of propaganda?
 ‘Not safe’
Miller, Trump, and DeSantis insist the people ICE rounds up are “the worst of the worst, the most heinous of the most heinous.”
Again, the data show this is not true. Only 8% of undocumented detainees have been convicted of violent crimes.
This country is still — nominally — a nation of laws, and everyone thrown into an ICE dungeon is entitled to due process.
Even our supine Supreme Court agrees.
But Florida’s tropical tent prison makes it nearly impossible for detainees to consult with attorneys, meaning they could be deported without fair hearings.
A group of lawmakers, including Rep. Anna Eskamani and Sen. Carlos Guillermo Smith, tried to visit the facility a couple of weeks ago. Inmates from the Orange County jail — which is in Eskamani’s and Smith’s districts — had been transferred there without being charged with anything.
Legislators pointed out Florida Statute 944.23 allows them to visit state facilities “at their pleasure.”
But DeSantis’ people insist the Everglades prison camp is not technically a state facility, not under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections.
Even though the state of Florida’s paying for it.
 ‘Emergency’ powers
Actually, the Trump administration admits it’s a state facility.
In a filing asking a federal judge to deny a request by Friends of the Everglades and the Center for Biodiversity to halt construction in Big Cypress, the administration argues the plaintiffs’ claim depends on showing a final federal “agency action,” which they can’t because the feds haven’t “implemented, authorized, directed or funded Florida’s temporary detention center.”
Indeed, they insist, “Florida is constructing and operating the facility using state funds on state lands.”
DeSantis, Uthmeier, and Pam Bondi need to get their stories straight.
By last Saturday, legal problems had been overcome and the gulag had miraculously become “safe.”
A group of legislators got a curated tour, during which what you saw depended on who you were—and whether you gave a damn about the human beings locked up in there.
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz (D-Florida) took a thermometer with her, reporting an indoor temperature of at least 83 degrees.
Another Democratic lawmaker said some detainees were shackled to benches.
Republican state Sen. Blaise Ingoglia insisted it’s pretty nice: “I actually laid down in one of the beds and it was really comfortable.”
Sure. And everybody’s talked to a lawyer, there are no mosquitoes, and tropical storms? No problem!
Meanwhile back in reality, DeSantis’ vanity project has already flooded at least once.
Big Cypress is 96% wetlands. It’s wetlands’ job to flood.
When Ron DeSantis, claiming “emergency” powers, seized 39 square miles of Everglades land (nearly 25,000 acres) he claimed, “The environmental impact will be zero.”
DeSantis and the attorney general contend they’re merely taking over what Uthmeier calls “an old, virtually abandoned” airstrip.”
That airstrip is abandoned for a reason. It’s a relic of one of the most boneheaded ideas anyone in Florida ever had.
The Phoenix’s own Craig Pittman recently recounted how in 1968 a really stupid plan to build a huge airport in the Everglades galvanized support for preserving Florida’s River of Grass.
Fun fact: It was Florida’s then-Gov. Claude Kirk and his top aide Nathaniel Reed — who went on to help pass the Clean Water Act in 1972 and co-write the Endangered Species Act in 1973 — who led the fight to save Big Cypress.
Both were Republicans.
 Vandals
Back then, some conservatives wanted to conserve, not destroy.
DeSantis and Uthmeier belong to a new generation of environmental vandals.
They want us to believe Big Cypress is wasted space with a few snakes, some bugs, a cadre of demonic alligators programmed to chase brown folks.
Inconsequential. Nothing to see there.
The ignorance is embarrassing.
To the Miccosukee and the Seminoles, the land is holy: “We live here. Our ancestors fought and died here. They are buried here,” said one tribal leader. “The Big Cypress is part of us, and we are a part of it.”
The land is not empty, or “abandoned.”
Manatees and dolphins give birth to their young in the estuaries on the eastern side. Mullet, trout, grouper, silver perch, spiny lobster, oysters, and clams thrive amongst the mangrove roots.

(Getty Images)“Why is health care so expensive?” is the question I’ve been asked more than any other since joining the Indiana Hospital Association last year. It’s a critically important one, and while my answer usually begins with, “It’s complicated,” one thing is now certain: 
Reducing Indiana’s health care costs became even more complicated as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which is projected to cut nearly $13 billion from Indiana hospitals over the next decade. 
The effects of this legislation will trickle down to all Hoosier patients — not just those on Medicaid — as hospitals are forced to cost-shift these significant losses in the coming years.
Impact on Hoosier patients
It’s undeniable that many of Indiana’s hospitals are financially strained. This year alone in our state, Harrison County Hospital, a rural hospital, closed its OB unit, and Columbus Regional Hospital announced a significant reduction in services. In addition, Logansport Memorial Hospital and Parkview Health entered into a partnership to ensure Hoosiers in Cass County continue to have access to care close to home.
Under the OBBBA, 180,000 individuals in Indiana are estimated to lose their Medicaid coverage. But Hoosiers without any insurance are still going to seek treatment — and their local hospital will be the only place they can turn to, most likely in the emergency room, which is the most expensive option for care. Hospitals will be forced to make difficult decisions to cover the care for everyone who enters their doors, regardless of their ability to pay, as health care costs are only going to increase in the future.
The ensuing ripple effect will likely bring about longer wait times for patients in emergency rooms and overall reduced access to care. Communities throughout the state will see possible hospital staffing impacts, reductions to clinical and community services, and in some instances, additional consolidation or closure of health care facilities altogether.
Projected losses for Indiana and its hospitals
According to the Urban Institute and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the expected Medicaid reductions from the OBBBA will cost Indiana an estimated $31 billion over the next decade, the seventh-highest total dollar impact across the nation. In other words, only six states will see higher cuts than Indiana.
Of that, Indiana hospitals will lose $12.7 billion with even lower Medicaid reimbursement than they receive today, which is just 57 cents on the dollar.
Throughout the state, 67% of care provided by hospitals is paid for by Medicare or Medicaid. Imagine running a business where two-thirds of your customers are purchasing your product at a price far below your actual costs. No business can sustain such losses for long. And your local hospital is no different.

Medicare and Medicaid make up an even higher percentage of care provided in rural communities, in which 72% of patients are covered by these programs, and largely why nearly one-third of Indiana’s rural hospitals are today operating at a loss.
Rural hospitals will fare no better than their urban and suburban counterparts, even after the inclusion of the new rural hospital stabilization funding in the OBBBA to offset the future Medicaid cuts. While details of how the funds will be allotted are still unknown, we appreciate Congress enacting this measure. Unfortunately, it won’t be enough to cover expected losses, and there is no additional assistance following the end of the OBBBA’s five-year period. 
As dire as the situation is for Indiana, we would be in far worse shape had state policymakers not taken decisive action this past legislative session to supplement Indiana’s low Medicaid reimbursement through a new State Directed Payment Program (SDPP), which will provide hospitals some slightly enhanced Medicaid funding. IHA very much appreciates Gov. Mike Braun and the Indiana General Assembly for recognizing the need for this critical funding to help sustain Hoosier hospitals and protect access for patients. 
However, under the OBBBA, this new SDPP reimbursement that hospitals will be depending on will be short-lived as it will begin to phase down over five years beginning in 2028, and Indiana’s Medicaid reimbursement for hospitals will drop even lower in 2032 than it is today.

Despite these significant challenges, Indiana hospitals remain committed to working with federal and state officials to find the best path forward to ensure continued access to affordable health care for all Hoosiers. It will take all of us – hospitals, policy leaders, payors, employers, and consumers – to come to the table to find workable solutions. The financial stability of our entire health system and the 6.8 million Hoosier lives it serves are depending on it.

(Ellen Schmidt/Minnesota Reformer)Minnesota is in the midst of a housing shortage. We need more than 100,000 new homes to meet the needs of Minnesota residents, families and communities. And as someone who has recently been out in the housing market, looking for a new place to call home, I can say first hand: This shortage of homes has real consequences.
As noted in a recent Reformer article, “Homebuying options remain slim for middle-income earners” potential homeowners face stiff competition, bidding wars and very few homes that are affordable to people who earn the average Minnesota wage. 
Renters face an even bleaker situation, with rents rising rapidly in communities across the state, and little options to move and find lower rents. This competition is the direct result of the lack of homes. 
The ripple effects of this affects more than just the people looking to find a home. 
Workers can’t find jobs close to home, leaving them to commute longer and longer distances, spending time away from their families. 
Employers can’t find people to work who live within a reasonable distance, who can easily get to work reliably. 
Young people can’t stay in the communities they grew up in, meaning they live further and further away from families and support networks. 
And, older adults ready to downsize can’t find new homes to move to that are accessible and affordable, leaving them stuck in big houses that are too much to take care of.
Minnesotans are being shut out of the communities they want to live in, and one of the causes is that cities are maintaining a set of inflexible and exclusionary rules to prevent the homes we need and want from being built. As a state, we could allow townhomes, duplexes, backyard cottages and apartments above shops. We used to allow these choices, but cities across our state have adopted rules that prevent these home types from being built in a movement to exclude people that goes back to the early 20th century. 
It’s time for a change. As Sen. Jordan Rasmusson of Fergus Falls said during a legislative hearing this year, “On housing policy, the aspiration ought to be that Minnesotans choose the communities they want to live in, not let communities pick which Minnesotans get to live there.”  At every stage of life, Minnesotans should be able to find a home that meets their needs — but city rules are intentionally holding us back this goal.
In my own home search, I found just a few options in my price range that also met my criteria. I wanted to live a walkable distance to my father, and in a place that allowed pets. Like many of my generation, I’m concerned with climate change, so having a place that would share walls and utilities with other households was a priority. Studies show that having multiple homes under one roof that share walls experience less heat loss, and use less energy to heat and cool the same space.
Sadly, while the Legislature had an opportunity to address this problem this past session — bipartisan, bicameral bills that would have allowed more home types to be built in more communities — they chose not to act. Instead, legislators chose to allow the cities to delay addressing our housing shortage, to deny they are part of the problem, and to continue to exclude Minnesotans.  
The good news? Advocates like us will be back at the Capitol next year, ready to share our stories, and to demand that legislators take action to allow more homes. 
Home is too important to leave to a patchwork of local laws designed to exclude people. We know we can solve this problem — we just need our state leaders to act like it too.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Minnesota-Reformer-File-49-1024x683.jpg,,,2025-07-14 07:10:46.639014

Minnesota has among the most costly child care in the nation. (Photo by Getty Images) Minnesota’s fertility rate is following national trends downward. It could spell trouble for the economy and state budget, according to a new report from the Pew Research Center, a nonpartisan think tank. 
In 2023, Minnesota had its lowest fertility rate in more than 30 years. Measured by the number of children born per 1,000 women between 15 and 44 years old, it was 55.7 compared to an average of 64.2 between 2011 and 2020. This drop was slightly higher than the national average. 
Historically, fertility rates have decreased during economic downturns but later bounced back. This changed after the 2008 recession, and the beginning of the pandemic saw a drop without a long-term recovery. 
The state may see some benefits from the fertility decline in the short term, with fewer students driving lower education costs. The number of elementary-age public school students has been decreasing at a slow pace for almost a decade, in part due to falling birth rates. But this also has the potential to reduce enrollment-based federal funding, such as Title I grants. 
In the long run, however, the working age population will be smaller, decreasing tax revenues  and economic growth. This new economic reality is arriving soon: The children born during the 2008 recession — when fertility rates were low — will reach adulthood in 2026. 
The size of Minnesota’s workforce is an ongoing concern, particularly as baby boomers retire. In October 2024, there were two job openings for every one unemployed worker. 
The current fertility rate decline is being driven in part by who is having children and when. Fertility rates are down among teenagers and Hispanic women. People are also waiting longer to have children and having fewer kids over their lifetimes. 
Researchers attribute these trends to financial considerations like student debt, housing costs and the price of child care. Minnesota has among the most costly child care in the nation. 
Societal changes also play a role, as more people prioritize their education and careers and marry later in life. 
But fertility rates aren’t the only demographics that are changing. Migration and an aging population paint a complicated picture for Minnesota’s future. 
In 2024, international and domestic migration was the biggest contributor to population growth in every state except Alaska. In 2023, foreign-born workers made up 10.9% of Minnesota’s labor force. International immigration has declined significantly under President Trump’s policies, which is likely to impact the labor market. 
As the population ages, funding the increasing costs of health care and long-term care for older adults will also prove a challenge, especially with the fewer workers resulting from a low fertility rate. This comes as impending federal Medicaid cuts shift more of these costs to states.",https://minnesotareformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/GettyImages-1532870985-1024x461.jpg,,,2025-07-14 07:10:46.639014

(Connect Images for Getty Images)In the face of growing health care costs, many employers have turned to self-insured plans, where they assume the financial risks on the chance that they might save some money. And it’s a popular option for Hoosiers. 
Even as reliance on self-insured, or self-funded, plans shrinks across the country, the insurance option is growing in Indiana. The average privately employed Hoosier is 20% more likely to be enrolled in a self-insured plan than the average privately employed American. 
  Dr. Nir Menachemi, Dean of the Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health at Indiana University (Photo from IU)
Dr. Nir Menachemi, the dean of the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, co-authored a study published in November breaking down the reasons for Indiana’s health care costs. One of the most significant takeaways was Indiana’s reliance on self-insured plans when compared to the national average.
“Indiana is bucking the trend nationally and in the neighborhood in terms of … having more people in self-insured plans,” said Menachemi. 
Nationwide, self-insured plans fell by 6.64% between 2020 and 2024. All of Indiana’s neighbors reported decreases in their self-insured rate but Indiana bucked the trend — instead increasing by 6.11% during that time. 
In Indiana, two-thirds of private sector employees are enrolled in self-insured plans — but this number is likely an undercount, since the data only includes private-sector employees. Some of Indiana’s largest self-insured, public organizations aren’t included in this analysis. 
But self-insured employers are also likely to pay more in hospital costs. The relatively high number of self-insured employers compared to other states might also help to explain why lawmakers have focused much of their attention on reducing hospital costs as part of their overall efforts to tackle the state’s high health care costs. 
 What is a self-insured plan?

Self-insured plans are one of a handful of options available to employers looking to purchase health insurance plans for their employees. For certain employers — especially those with a relatively healthy workforce — opting for a self-insured plan can be a way to reduce health care costs.
Actuaries will calculate an estimated cost for insuring a workforce and a fully insured plan will include some overhead for the insurer administering the plan. Insurers, seeking a profit, will also set a premium that allows for that while also accounting for any state-specific administrative costs. 
“Insurance is buying and selling risk. Self-insurance means not buying and selling risk. And if I know my population is healthy enough and, generally speaking, more educated — why should I pay someone else to take the risk that I’m happy to bear myself?” Menachemi said. “I’ll put all that money in the bank and just pay for people’s health care as they need it.”
IU study: Indiana stands out for its reliance on self-insured, high-deductible plans

The employer can then keep whatever’s left unused at the end of the year. 
But the plans come with a significant drawback: a loss in contract negotiating power. 
Parties negotiate prices with each contract, with insurers using their large pools of enrollees to get lower prices from providers like hospitals. These negotiations are largely impacted by the presence of competitors, such as multiple insurance options or health systems. 
But self-insured employers don’t have that same strength, even though they are likely to tap insurers as Third Party Administrators to handle billing services and the like, including provider arrangements. Menachemi noted that researchers don’t have access to a lot of details about administrators and payment decisions, which are usually considered proprietary and typically are only publicized following a lawsuit. 
Previously, those third-party administrators didn’t have any specifically outlined duty to employers, though a recent legislative effort seeks to rebalance the scales. 
“I’m super eager to see how this all plays out,” said Menachemi, also naming other health care priority bills from the 2025 session, such as one studying hospital pricing. 
Menachemi’s analysis, a follow-up from a similar study in 2020, recommended that self-insured employers counter this by grouping together for their negotiations to seek lower provider prices. 
“If six large employers got together and basically said, ‘We want to buy insurance together.’ That’s a purchasing alliance and then they’d have more power than any one of them alone,” Menachemi said. “That’s a market solution that doesn’t require regulatory intervention.”
State lawmakers can’t regulate self-insured plans because they fall under a federal law known as ERISA, or the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act. Initially developed to create a universal set of standards for insurers across state lines, legislators have been stymied in some of their transparency efforts by the federal statute because they can’t compel companies to participate in efforts like the All Payers Claims Database. 
At a panel with the Indiana Fiscal Policy Institute at the end of May, employers of some of Indiana’s largest employers shared their perspectives on growing health care costs.
Lawrence McCormack, the director of government relations with Cummins, said the company operated in all 50 states — making self-insurance attractive — and had “some visibility” when it came to different costs across state lines. 
“Indiana’s costs are higher than what we see in some other states and so what we do, and what we’ve been doing for the last five or 10 years, is really working with the legislature, with some of the policy makers, to figure out, how do we address these health care costs?” McCormack said. “… we just want to see that addressed because it is truly making Indiana less competitive with our neighboring states when we’ve done such a good job of creating a really strong business climate here.”

But, as the IU study also details, Hoosiers are generally less healthy than other Americans, across various measures for mortality, asthma, smoking, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. 
Overall, Indiana’s mortality rate is 16% higher than the nation’s rate. Public health efforts seeking to reverse these stats have recently seen significant state funding cuts.

For the most part, the average employee wouldn’t notice a difference between a fully insured or self-insured plan. However, self-insured plans are more likely to also have lower monthly premiums but higher deductibles. 
This requires an enrollee to pay more out-of-pocket costs — another area where Indiana is an outlier — before insurance coverage starts. 
The prevalence of high-deductible health plans — which covers 64% of Hoosiers compared to 54% nationally — partially explains why Hoosiers pay more in out-of-pocket costs than their peers as employers shift costs to employees in another attempt to save money. While this plan type grew by 9% nationwide between 2020 and 2024, it increased by 23% in Indiana. 
According to a New York Times article from earlier this month, health care industries are now the top employer in 38 states — but not Indiana, where manufacturing is still the top employer. Outside of manufacturing, other labor-intensive industries — such as agriculture, which is also a major Indiana employer — are more likely to be self-insured than other professions. 
With these types of companies playing an outsized role in Indiana, it’s clear that self-insurance is something stakeholders will continue to consider in the face of increasing health care costs. 
“If you want to be a business-friendly state, you’re going to attract the kinds of employers that are increasingly … going to be self-insured,” Menachemi said.

(Laurel Demkovich/Washington State Standard)A Republican-led effort to make Washington residents prove they are U.S. citizens before receiving a ballot is hitting the streets.
Backers of an initiative requiring a person to provide proof of citizenship as part of the voter registration process have begun gathering signatures after a Thurston County judge settled a dispute on how the measure would be described on ballots.
Under the proposed measure, one would need an enhanced driver’s license or enhanced identicard, or present another form of identification like a passport or birth certificate at a county auditor’s office when they first register. Existing voters would have their registrations canceled if they fail to produce such proof by the November 2027 election when the changes would take effect.
This would be a seismic political change. On the current Washington voter registration form, a person marks a box indicating they are a citizen.
“This says you just can’t check a box,” said Jim Walsh, a state lawmaker from Aberdeen and chair of the Washington State Republican Party, who filed Initiative to the Legislature 126, or IL-26. “This does not touch mail-in voting in any way. It does not touch the transaction of voting.”
Walsh said the measure is intended to complement an executive order issued by President Donald Trump that, broadly, seeks to make states require individuals to show proof of citizenship to register.  That order, which threatened to cut federal funds to states that did not comply, is currently blocked by a legal challenge.
Opponents contend the “confusing and onerous” in-person proof-of-citizenship requirements will deter potential new voters from registering and knock existing voters from the rolls. 
“No matter what we look like or where we come from, all voters in Washington must have the opportunity to make their voices heard at the ballot box,” said Roxana Norouzi, executive director of OneAmerica, a statewide immigrant rights organization.
OneAmerica challenged a portion of the ballot title last month. It argued that the proposed four-word statement of the subject matter – “concerns voter registration requirements” – did not adequately describe the breadth of the impact.
Last Thursday, Thurston County Superior Court Judge John Skinder ordered the statement be revised to read the measure “concerns heightened voter registration requirements for applicants and currently registered voters.”
OneAmerica officials said this is a clearer statement of what the policy is about.
Walsh was happy with the outcome, confident that the additional wording will be beneficial for gathering signatures. “I think it’s lovely. This idea polls astronomically well,” he said. 
To be eligible for the ballot, supporters must turn in at least 308,911 registered voters by Jan 2, 2026.
As an initiative to the Legislature, if they have the requisite number, it will first go to lawmakers who could adopt it as written. If they do not act, the measure would then go on the November 2026 ballot. Legislators could approve an alternative to be placed on the ballot alongside the initiative if they want, as well.
Under the proposed measure, a person registering for the first time must complete the voter registration form as well as have one of the required documents. 
For existing voters, county auditors, by July 1, 2027 must work with the state Department of Licensing to see which ones have an enhanced driver’s license or identicard. Those that do remain registered automatically.
Those who do not will get a notice to go to their county auditor’s office and present one of the approved documents to show they are a citizen. Reminder notices must be sent. A voter has up until 14 days before the November 2027 election to produce documents.
In 2023, Walsh teamed up with Let’s Go Washington, founded and led by fund manager Brian Heywood, to qualify six initiatives to the Legislature. Lawmakers adopted three and voters rejected the other three when they appeared on the November 2024 ballot.
Let’s Go Washington was not involved as of Friday.",https://washingtonstatestandard.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/ballots-Large-1024x768.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 07:10:46.639014

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.



There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

“I did not get one call, email, etc., when I introduced this last session,” Cohn said, a Democrat who represents a southern portion of St. Louis city. “And then all of a sudden, it’s like everyone is coming out of the woodwork — and I haven’t even requested a hearing on this yet.”
His bill would prohibit hemp-derived THC beverages and edibles from being sold outside of marijuana dispensaries, which would effectively ban them. Intoxicating hemp products, sometimes labeled as “Delta-8,”  have largely been unregulated in Missouri since 2018, when Congress passed a Farm Bill that legalized hemp.
This year, Cohn gotten calls from “every single media outlet,” he said, along with hemp beverage distributors, hemp edible companies and lobbyists.
His bill comes right on the heels of a heated battle between St. Louis-area state senators this spring over a similar proposal.
Cohn’s bill has the same language as the legislation sponsored by conservative Republican state Sen. Nick Schroer of Defiance this year.
Intoxicating hemp regulations stall in Missouri Senate after 7-hour filibuster

In April, Schroer’s proposal was met by fierce opposition from St. Louis Democratic state senators Karla May, Steve Roberts and Angela Mosley, who led a seven-hour filibuster to kill the bill.
“It reminds me so much of a street drug war,” said May, during a Senate floor debate on April 9, “where you got these people over here saying you can’t infringe on my territory…I don’t think we should be using law to create an unfair business advantage.”
Several Republican state senators backed the filibuster, saying they were also opposed to what they described as a “monopolistic attempt” by the marijuana industry to squash its competition. 
Now the fight has been taken to a local stage, where both the St. Louis County Council and St. Louis city’s Board of Aldermen are considering an effective ban as well.
In January, St. Louis County Councilwoman Lisa Clancy proposed a nearly identical bill to Cohn’s and is only one vote away from the bill’s final passage. She said she hasn’t heard from the St. Louis senators who filibustered or industry members. 
The bill tasks the county’s health department with enforcement — including seizing and destroying the products. She’s been working with the county health department, she said, to make sure its leaders understand how it will be implemented before taking it to a final vote.
Clancy, Cohn and Schroer all argue that it isn’t an industry war but a “public health crisis.”
The St. Louis city and county legislation differs from Schroer’s because he ended up carving out an exception for low-dose THC beverages that have been sold in Missouri’s bars and liquor stores for seven years. It still required things like high-dose gummies, THCA flower and vapes to only be sold in marijuana dispensaries.  
Cohn sees the bill he filed on June 27 as a “placeholder,” he said, and he wants to have a discussion about how to move forward with regulation. 
“I’m happy to have the conversations to get to the end result where we’re protecting kids and health and welfare,” he said. “It’s not only the idea that there’s not even an age limit on these things. You don’t know what people are putting in these synthetic products.”
Cohn has strong support from the city’s aldermanic president Megan Green, who co-sponsored the bill. 
“The fact that largely untested, unregulated, and untaxed products can be purchased at gas stations by kids is simply not sustainable,” Green told The Independent in an email last week.
Mayor Cara Spencer did not respond to The Independent’s requests for comment regarding the issue. 
St. Louis County Executive Sam Page didn’t mention a particular stance in his statement to The Independent, but said, “There needs to be robust discussion on what regulation would look like, and I appreciate Councilwoman Clancy leading these efforts.”
A product ban
  State Rep. Dave Hinman, a Republican from O’Fallon, toured the warehouse of St. Louis-based Triple High Seltzer, a hemp-derived THC beverage, on Feb. 7 with the company’s founder Will Spartin (Rebecca Rivas/The Missouri Independent).
Hemp naturally has very little THC, the intoxicating component mostly associated with marijuana. But that potency can be increased with some science.
While marijuana products must be sold in dispensaries and be grown and manufactured in state-regulated facilities, intoxicating hemp products are completely unregulated by any governmental agency. 
There’s no state or federal law saying teenagers or children can’t buy them or stores can’t sell them to minors. However, some stores and vendors have taken it upon themselves to impose age restrictions of 21 and up.










I don’t think we need to move everything into dispensaries. And two, I don’t think it’s a good idea for city-by-city regulation.


– State Rep. Dave Hinman of O'Fallon


If the St. Louis bills pass, all intoxicating hemp products would be put under the state’s definition of marijuana — which would create a ban on available products. 
Here’s why: Licensed cannabis dispensaries wouldn’t be able to sell these intoxicating hemp products either because the hemp used to make them has to be grown in Missouri and processed in licensed cultivation and manufacturing facilities – just as marijuana is. Nearly all of these products currently on the market are made from hemp grown in other states. 
Marijuana licenses are also limited.
That’s why the state lawmakers who filibustered argued the legislation would cause a “marijuana monopoly.” 
Another St. Louis player — Steven Busch, who owns St. Peters-based Krey Distributing — pushed for an alternative licensing structure this year that looks more similar to how alcohol and tobacco retailers are licensed.
He worked with Republican state Rep. Dave Hinman of O’Fallon on a bill to allow beverages, edibles and vapes to continue to be sold outside of dispensaries, but be licensed and regulated under the Division of Alcohol and Tobacco Control. 
Hinman’s proposal required age restrictions and clear labeling on all products, as well as testing to be completed by independent labs that have the same accreditation the Missouri Division of Cannabis Regulation requires of licensed marijuana testing labs.
In the end, there were too many differing opinions among hemp industry members to get the bill passed. 
A sticking point for Busch was THCA flower, which looks and acts like marijuana buds. He believes it shouldn’t be sold outside of a dispensary, and other hemp advocates ardently disagreed.
Busch said it’s a “slippery slope” for municipalities to pass laws that ban everything in this category. 
“I think that some of it can be safe,” Busch said, “but some of it is really taking advantage of the Farm Bill and should be banned.”
Busch agreed with the carve out in Schroer’s bill that capped the amount of THC at five milligrams per can. It excluded drinks made with “synthetic” THC, or THC that has been converted from CBD using a chemical process. 
Other advocates said the cap on THC was too low and limiting.
Hinman will be filing another bill next year, he said, incorporating all the conversations he had throughout the past legislative session. 
“I don’t think we need to move everything into dispensaries,” he said. “And two, I don’t think it’s a good idea for city-by-city regulation. I believe 100% this should be done statewide through the state legislature.”
Missouri cities of Gladstone, Farmington and Chesterfield have already passed municipal ordinances that ban or highly restrict these products.
Intoxicating gummies
  Gov. Mike Parson speaks at his Capitol press conference in August 2024 announcing Executive Order 24-10 that bans the sale of intoxicating hemp products in Missouri “until such time approved sources can be regulated by the FDA or State of Missouri through legislative action,” he said. (photo courtesy of Missouri Governor’s Office).
Last summer, Total Wine — the country’s largest liquor retailer — set the tone for the alcohol industry when it began carrying hemp-derived THC infused beverages at its seven Missouri stores. 
One of its featured products was intoxicating hemp seltzers from St. Louis-based company Mighty Kind.
“It has been amazing for us,” Joshua Grigaitis, owner of Mighty Kind, told The Independent last summer. “When somebody like Total Wine comes on board, it helps the conversation along greatly.”
In some St. Louis bars, his products make up 30-40% of their sales, he said.
Grigaitis and his team have spent the last seven years educating people on how they make their products and why they can buy a THC product outside of a dispensary — because the 2018 Farm Bill legalized hemp.
He welcomes regulation, he said, because it would help the industry grow. But that conversation has stalled out among state lawmakers the last two years.
That’s why – not long after Grigaitis learned about Total Wine last year – former Gov. Mike Parson signed an executive order last August banning intoxicating hemp products and threatening penalties to any establishment with a Missouri liquor license or that sells food products for selling them. 
Like the St. Louis bills, he tasked the state health department with enforcement.
Ultimately, Parson’s order was put on hold a month later, after a series of political and legal barriers. 
Grigaitis said he can only speak for the hemp beverage industry but there are a number of testing and other compliance requirements that distributors and retailers like Total Wine require in order to “just do business.” 
“Everybody has a list of things you have to do to qualify or be compliant,” he said. “So it’s not like this wild west.”
Clancy said she’s “not looking to put Mighty Kind out of business.”
“I’m not trying to ram anything through quickly without stakeholder input and getting something that works for those people,” she said. “My concerns are about the shady actors.”
Like Parson and Cohn, Clancy said she’s most concerned about the edibles. She said she has test results from edibles purchased from stores in the county and city. 
“And what they’re finding is that these are made out of things like mulch,” she said. “I know people personally who purchased them from convenience stores and have gotten sick.”
In terms of beverages, Brian Dix, owner of St. Louis city-based Craft Republic alcohol distributing company, said the bill will just push people to go buy hemp beverages online. Some of his seltzers are top items in the Tik Tok shop. 
“It’s a massive industry,” he said of online sales and social media marketing. “If the city is taking this kind of position, it doesn’t make me want to stay in the city.”

BURLINGTON — While sitting on the hills of Shelburne Farms, a sustainable education farm near Burlington, Kelly Knudsen was given an invitation. She, along with the group she sat near, were asked what movement they could see. At first, Knudsen, confused by the question, didn’t see anything.
Then, she focused. She saw the soft swaying of singular branches, the slight shift in fine blades of grass, the unexpected appearance of a bird, and clouds, making their slow expedition towards her. 
That newfound attention is what forest bathing is all about, according to Knudsen. The process of slowing down, a process that Knudsen began even before she received a diagnosis of non-cancerous meningioma in December. 
Forest bathing, based off the Japanese practice “Shinrin-yoku,” emphasizes intentionally surrounding oneself in nature and staying focused on the present. It can take many forms such as meditating, walking, or group discussions. As forest bathing gains popularity in Vermont and New York, some have begun pursuing the therapeutic act as part of their healing journey through complex medical conditions. 
Stacey LaFave, an oncology social worker, hit her wall with healthcare and became a certified forest bathing guide through the Association of Nature and Forest Therapy Guides and Programs in 2022. 
LaFave now runs an eight-month forest bathing support group for cancer patients out of the initial treatment phase — the first line of treatment to control the cancer — through the CVPH Fitzpatrick Cancer Center, a hospital in Plattsburgh, New York that’s part of the University of Vermont Health Network. 
Between early April and November, her patients can attend bi-weekly, closed sessions in the woods of New York’s Point Au Roche State Park. She guided her first group last year and took on a second group in the spring. 
“The goal is to just walk and really notice, to get them out of their heads and into their bodies,” LaFave said. 
LaFave’s group members span a variety of ages and stages in cancers and treatments. The younger members are in their 40s and the oldest are in their 80s, LaFave said. One of her patients had been diagnosed with a second cancer during the sessions. LaFave said that being surrounded by a world of support helped her deal with the diagnosis. 
“I think she was at peace with it,” LaFave said. 
But typically, she said, cancer doesn’t take center stage. 
“We don’t talk about cancer that much,” LaFave said. “Maybe cancer was the one thing everybody had in common, but often people talked just about anything.” 
Through support groups like LaFave’s people around the world are implementing the practice into their healthcare decisions as researchers have found that medical patients who spend more time in greenspaces can see their health improve.
“People that engaged with this greenspace, they had more beneficial health outcomes,” said Dr. Jean Bikomeye, a researcher at the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee who published a 2022 review showing that in five cancer-related studies, cancer patients who spent more time gardening, forest bathing, and just more time outside overall had improved health effects.  
“We saw improvement in strength and weight loss,” Bikomeye said. His team also saw an improvement in biological markers such as inflammation and an overall quality of life, according to the study. 
Knudsen, who participated in forest bathing sessions long before her diagnosis, saw the effects on her everyday life. 
“In today’s society it’s so hard for many of us to slow down and be present in the moment,” she said. But when you do that, she added, “You develop more of a gratitude for the natural world.”
Knudsen is an outdoor educator at Shelburne farms. She works with kids at the farm by getting them outside and fostering a relationship with the natural world. One activity she does with them is called “Fist Full of Sounds” where she gets the kids to stop, close their eyes, and shout out all the sounds they hear. 
“When kids are coming to the farm, a lot of the time they really just need to play and explore and be curious in the natural world,” she said. “To me, forest bathing is a way that as adults we’re going out and just playing in the forest and being curious about what’s around us.” 
Knudsen’s forest bathing sessions are also held at the farms and have always been led by Duncan Murdoch who has been a certified Nature Forest Therapy Guide since 2015. He guides primarily group walks with a variety of people. This includes those being affected by cancer. 
Around the same time Knudsen received her diagnosis, she learned from another session member that they had been diagnosed with cancer. The two of them have stayed connected beyond the forest bathing group ever since. 
“For three hours, you’re with people who get it,” Murdoch said. “That feels really healing.” 
Much like other guides, Murdoch uses all five senses as a means of focusing on the present. Smell, touch, sound, and sight come easy, but to experience taste, both he and LaFave make a tea at the end of their sessions, either out of plants or mushrooms. 
Six months after LaFave finished her 2024 session, she sent out a follow up survey to her patients who reflected on their experience and how it’s changed their lives.
“I got in touch with nature, made great friendships with others, and it gave me a large amount of personal growth,” said one anonymous patient. 
Another said that after the treatment their house was now full of houseplants. “I met other people who have taught me a lot about surviving positively after cancer,” another anonymous patient said. 
These are reflections from what LaFave tries to teach in every session, she said:  “The forest is the therapist, we’re just the guide.”

(Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Billions of dollars at stake for farmers hit by Trump funding freeze, foreign aid pause

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas.

(Henry Redman | Wisconsin Examiner)Now that work on the state budget is complete, environmental groups and residents of communities affected by PFAS contamination believe progress can still be made on getting money out the door to help remediate water pollution across the state. 
Since the last biennial budget was passed, $125 million in funds meant to help with cleaning up contamination of water from PFAS has been sitting untouched with no legislative mechanism for getting that money out to communities.
PFAS, a family of man-made chemical compounds known as “forever chemicals” because they don’t break down in the environment, have been connected to cancer and other diseases. The chemicals have been used in products such as firefighting foam and household goods such as non-stick pans and fast food wrappers. Communities across the state have found PFAS contamination in their water. 
During the last legislative session, early hopes of compromise crumbled after Democrats and Republicans failed to reach agreement on a provision aimed at protecting “innocent landowners” from being subject to enforcement actions for PFAS contamination under the state’s toxic spills law by the Department of Natural Resources. 
Republicans, including the bill’s author, Sen. Eric Wimberger (R-Oconto) argued the bill had to include language that protected people who have PFAS contamination on their property through no fault of their own. Democrats said the language in the bill defining innocent landowners was so broad that it would exempt property owners responsible for pollution from being held responsible. 
Ultimately, Gov. Tony Evers vetoed the bill. 
Wimberger and Rep. Tim Mursau (R-Crivitz) authored legislation this year to get the $125 million earmarked for PFAS remediation out the door. 
Sara Walling, Clean Wisconsin’s water and agriculture program director, says she’s “hopeful” that discussions between the Republican bill authors, Evers and affected residents have been productive. 
“There is opportunity now I think that the budget is done for Wimberger and others, of course, to pay attention, put a little energy into this, and really sit down and hash out the provisions in there, and get to a point that there’s something hopefully that we can all live with, and that will get the money to impacted communities and private well owners and all the things that the money is intended to be used for,” Walling says. 
While people see progress being made, there are still objections to the legislation. Wimberger and Mursau have proposed two bills, one of which exempts certain groups of people from enforcement under the spills law. 
Exempting ‘innocent landowners’
The exemptions include anyone who spread biosolids or wastewater contaminated with PFAS onto a field while in compliance with a DNR permit; owns land on which contaminated biosolids were spread under a permit; a fire department, public airport or municipality that used PFAS-contaminated firefighting foam to train for or respond to emergencies; solid waste disposal facilities that accepted PFAS and anyone that owns, leases, manages, or contracts for property on which PFAS has moved through the groundwater (unless they caused the contamination on another piece of property). 
Earlier this year, Evers suggested he’d support exempting farmers and residents from being held financially responsible for cleaning up PFAS contamination if they unknowingly caused it by spreading contaminated biosolids. 
But Walling says she’d like to see that language tightened further to make sure it does not create a loophole for responsible parties. 
“The provisions that are laid on that out there now just provide far too big of a loophole for who would be considered an innocent landowner in the current bill language,” she said. “And we really want to see that tightened so that truly innocent landowners, the passive receivers, the farmers out there who unknowingly were accepting municipal biosolids … those are the innocent landowners that I know that the authors are trying to protect.” 
What’s an allowable level of PFAS?
The other bill creates the mechanisms and grant programs through which the $125 million would be awarded to affected communities. 
Doug Oitzinger is the former mayor and a current city councilmember of Marinette and a founder of a group of community members fighting to clean up PFAS pollution in his area from the manufacture of fire suppression technologies by Tyco/Johnson Controls. 
Oitzinger says he’s wary of a provision in the bill that exempts private property owners who don’t qualify as innocent landowners from enforcement under the spills law unless the level of PFAS present violates an existing state or federal standard. The federal government doesn’t regulate groundwater and for years the state Department of Natural Resources has been unable to promulgate an administrative rule that sets the allowable amount of PFAS in groundwater. 
The DNR failed once because of a deadlocked vote on the state Natural Resources Board and a second time because the proposed rule had a potential economic impact greater than $10 million and therefore required approval of the full Legislature under a law known as the REINS Act. 
The DNR is currently working on the economic impact analysis of another proposed groundwater standard. Oitzinger says he’s doubtful that proposal will stay clear of the REINS Act. So, he says, he’s working with Mursau to include a groundwater standard in the bill. 
The most significant amendment Oitzinger is fighting for in the legislation is the creation of a temporary standard for the regulation of PFAS in Wisconsin’s groundwater. 
“We’ve been working to see if legislatively, we can get something that does not undermine the spills law to get the $125 million out the door, that the governor would sign, that we would be in support of and, at the same time, establish some kind of interim groundwater standard for PFAS,” Oitzinger says. 
As someone fighting for a community that’s been heavily polluted with PFAS, Oitzinger says his goal is to find a compromise that helps people get clean water, even if environmental and industry groups aren’t fully satisfied. 
“It doesn’t do us any good to get into our respective camps and not find common ground,” he says. “And then the bill reaches the governor’s office and he vetoes it. That’s not helping anybody, so we’ve got to find compromise. Some of the environmental groups won’t like it, and certainly I think some of the industry lobbying groups won’t like it, but this is what we’ve got to do.”

We do.
But only if we are willing to take a stand and exercise it.
There is power in numbers.
We do not need to capitulate and succumb to the money and influence of the rich and powerful, their lobbyists, or the feckless and spineless elected officials who make decisions in their own self-interests rather than do the jobs they were sent to Jefferson City and Washington to do. 
We do not have to accept it.
The Preamble to the Constitution is worth revisiting as frequently as necessary during these political times as we witness and become recipients of what our government is doing that will negatively impact our lives.
“We the People of the United States, in Order to form a more perfect Union, establish Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defense, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution for the United States of America.”
As much as we may feel intimidated by, or reluctant to spend time to better understand the empowerment of the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of the State of Missouri, we need to. 
We need to pay close attention to the actions of elected officials in Jefferson City and Washington, and invest the time to determine how “we the people” can exercise the power we have to preserve our individual rights and our way of life as American citizens.
Before it is too late.
Before so much damage has been done that it will take years, if not decades, to recover.
Currently, and on many levels, we are experiencing what it is like to live in a country where its leaders seem hellbent on creating a hapless and hopeless society.
American optimism — all the positive energy, that can-do anything aura and attitude, the vision for a better life, a better society, a better world — where has it gone?
Is America becoming a country without compassion, courage, or one with a positive outlook for the future?
We seem to be under a cloud of discordant lies and deception, incivility, meanness, retribution, the grab and abuse of power among leaders and policymakers — all while those very perpetrators are trying to tell and convince us that such behavior is actually necessary to pass and implement policies for our own good.
Does our silence indicate we believe it, that we buy that the outcomes are in our best interest?
Why else is such behavior becoming the norm?
In Missouri, do you actually believe that denying workers family leave, for example, is good for low- or moderate-income employees? Do they not deserve some time off to take care of themselves or a family member when sick?
The Missouri governor with a stroke of pen cancelled paid sick leave, a measure that was passed overwhelming by 58% of voters. If that was not bad enough, the same bill signed into law also repeals the annual inflation adjustment to the minimum wage —something that has been done since 2006.
How will these actions help hardworking Missourians as the cost of living continues to rise?
Many Missourians, like many in other states, are at risk of losing their needed Medicaid benefits because the senators and representatives in Congress ultimately went along with the passage of future cuts.
On the national level, the promise to curb rising inflation, to control immigrants overtaking our borders, to end the war between Russia and Ukraine were the main reasons voters cast their votes for Republican candidates.
In reality, what has been done to successfully address those issues?
Not much.
What have we gotten instead? Indiscriminate deep destructive cuts in departments and services, putting the needs of many American at risk; inhumane and indiscriminate handling of illegal immigrants; and the war between Russia and Ukraine goes on.
And then there is passage of the “Big Beautiful Bill.
Do you know what is in it?
Do you know whether it will help or hurt one or more aspects of your quality of life?
You are probably thinking: If the elected officials we sent to Jefferson City and Washington are not functioning in our best interests — not stopping decisions and policies being passed that will hurt us — what can we do?
A lot.
First, prepare to vote those elected officials out of offices at the first opportunity. There is more power in the number of voters that go to the polls and vote than the money that may be infused in a campaign.
Money cannot vote.
Start now, if you haven’t, to keep a log of what your elected officials say and do. Just as important is to log what they fail to say or do when they have an opportunity. Did they go along to get along? Whose interests did they represent or fight for, if not yours?
Contact your elected officials repeatedly and in multiple ways. Taking time to write letters and make phone calls at a minimum. Meet with them at every opportunity. Encourage others in your orbit of influence and who share your concerns to join you. 
Research. Who is influencing, and contributing to elected officials? 
Organize. Discover whether there are eligible voters who are not voting for one reason or the other. Assist and encourage them to vote. Organize group discussions around issues you care about. Seek opportunities to participate in political organizations that share your concerns.
The greatest power that resides in the people is the “We.”
Will enough of us do what it takes to exercise that power and put it into action to make Missouri and America what they can be?
For the people.

Herbert pays for her 24/7 care through Medicaid, but this type of long-term care in her home is considered an optional benefit that states may offer under federal regulations. Herbert has been living under looming uncertainty about whether the service will be taken away after Congress this month passed a federal budget reconciliation bill that is expected to cut Medicaid spending by around $1 trillion over the next decade. 
“If they cut my Medicaid, I don’t know what to do, because I won’t move into a nursing home,” she said. “I can’t have my baby (Herbert’s cat Destiny is her “baby”) and people go to nursing homes to die.” 
The sweeping tax-and-spend bill passed by Congress July 1 makes a number of changes to Medicaid, and supporters and critics argue about how those will impact those who rely on the program for health care coverage. 
Many of the bill’s supporters, including Idaho’s Republican U.S. Sen. Mike Crapo, have said the bill’s reductions will protect the program for those who it was originally intended for, including children, pregnant women, and those with disabilities.

Kennedy Jr. to be the next Secretary of Health and Human Services on Feb. 4, 2025, in Washington, D.C. (Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)
Crapo serves as chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and played a key role in the passage of the budget bill. 
Crapo in an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun said that he considers the fear that many have expressed of people losing their Medicaid coverage is “inaccurate.” 
“The only way to prove this is to wait and see what actually happens,” he said. “But the bottom line is this, no one’s benefits were cut in this legislation, unless you are a person who is not an American citizen and not legally present in America.” 
He also noted that others will lose benefits if they don’t comply with new work requirements or if they were registered to receive payments from multiple states. 
 How the reconciliation bill will affect provider taxes, hospitals and health care providers

However, the bill’s limits on what are known as provider taxes — which allow states to tax hospitals to increase the amount of money in the program and therefore increase the amount the federal government matches — have left many wondering whether, with less money in the system, states will have to reduce or cut optional Medicaid benefits to balance their budgets. 
  Mel Leviton
“It gives you a bigger pot of money to draw down more, and when you reduce it, well, you’re not going to be able to draw down as much money,” said Mel Leviton, executive director of the Idaho State Independent Living Council. “I don’t see how that could not lead to cuts.”  
Idaho assesses hospitals, nursing facilities and intermediate care facilities and the amount assessed makes up the state share to draw down on federal Medicaid funding as a supplemental payment to those providers. The payment is the difference between what Medicare would have paid and what Medicaid did pay. 
In 2022, the Legislature approved a law that allowed the state to assess an additional amount from hospitals to pay for increased rates for home and community based services. 
The Idaho Department of Health and Welfare is “reviewing the bill to evaluate its impacts on Idaho,” agency spokesperson AJ McWhorter told the Idaho Capital Sun in an email.

 It’s unclear what health programs could be reduced, but some Idahoans fear the uncertainty 

Home and community based services — which allow health care workers to go into people’s homes rather than go to a residential care facility — are one of the optional services under Medicaid provided in Idaho, among many others. More than 20,000 Idahoans, including Herbert, receive some type of home and community based services, Leviton said. 
Other optional services include coverage of dental and vision care, prescription drugs, prosthetics, physical therapy, occupational therapy, respiratory care for those who rely on a ventilator, and case management. 
“It’s funny that they’re called optional benefits, because they’re not actually optional,” said Twin Falls resident Tara Rowe. 
  Tara Rowe
Rowe is enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare, but Medicaid covers her physical therapy visits that go beyond what Medicare will pay for. 
“It’s pretty much essential so I can function as a human,” Rowe said. “… it means me being mobile. It means me managing chronic pain, it’s just part of how I continue to deal with chronic illness and disability.” 
She knows first-hand what her life would look like without those services, because she has already lived through it. 
Rowe experienced her disabling event in 2008, when she was a 23-year-old graduate student. She didn’t successfully gain access to Medicaid and Medicare services until 2012. In that interim, she paid out-of-pocket for most of her services or went without.   
“I was not particularly mobile, I was not very independent,” Rowe said. “I had to rely on everyone in my life for something. I didn’t have the tools to manage pain. I didn’t have the tools to be sure that I didn’t cause more damage to my body. So I know the difference between trying to live with this and without that care, and what it is like now in the last 13 years of having care, it’s night and day.” 
In that time, she missed both her grandparents’ funerals because she wasn’t mobile enough to be able to go. 
With the services she receives now, she can live on her own without a care worker coming into her home. 
“I personally would rather feel good enough on any given day to do my own dishes rather than have someone else come and do it for me,” Rowe said. 
Moscow resident Larkin Seiler moved onto another optional Medicaid program, the self directed care service through the state’s developmental disabilities Medicaid system, when he wanted to move out of a certified family home and in with his then-girlfriend, now wife Jen Magelky-Seiler. 
Under the program, Seiler receives a budget from Medicaid to hire his own staff that come to his home and help him with the basics of living, such as hygiene, meal preparation, and transportation. The Medicaid money goes through a financial intermediary, and allows him to pay for a worker for 10 hours a day.

Seiler said the service allows him to keep his job at Alta Science & Engineering, Inc., where he has worked doing data entry for 26 years. It also keeps him and his wife together in their home, where they’ve lived 10 years. 
There are no agencies in Moscow offering the kind of in-home care that Seiler requires, he said. If he no longer had access to the program, he likely would have to go into a nursing home. 
Magelky-Seiler also has disabilities, but she said she doesn’t think she would qualify for that level of residential care under Medicaid. 
“It’s one of the things I worry most about cuts,” she said, “is losing our family, our home together.” 
 Medicaid recipients already face barriers to care in Idaho 

Idaho is facing a significant shortage of direct care workers, the type of health care providers who go into the homes of people such as Herbert and Seiler. 
Herbert previously had a need when her in-home care provider at the time went on vacation and her friend Mary Arndt stepped in to fill the position. 
“And I’ve never left, they never came back,” Arndt said. “I’ve been with Kristyn almost 20 years.” 
Arndt is 73-years-old, and said there are limitations on what she can do and how often she can come. Herbert was able to hire a couple more staff recently, but it had been a long time since anyone has applied, she said. Through Medicaid, she can pay her staff $20 an hour, which is set based on her level of care. 
Thousands of Idahoans could lose health care coverage under federal spending bill

Some of the people she has hired she later fired because they did things like stole food or otherwise tried to take advantage of Herbert. 
“She’s in a wheelchair. She’s disabled, but she’s not stupid,” Ardnt said, noting that Herbert often notices the un-professional behavior and quickly notifies her friend.  
Seiler is able to pay $17 an hour, which often doesn’t compete well with other jobs such as at McDonald’s, he and Magelky-Seiler said. 
Because there aren’t any Moscow agencies that provide care in the home, Seiler will post ads on Craigslist, put up flyers around town, and ask around through word of mouth to find staff. 
“Unfortunately, we get a lot of people who wouldn’t pass a background check,” Magelky-Seiler said. “It takes a lot of work to filter through people and make sure that they’re quality individuals that should be in our home and providing safe care.” 
Rowe said in the Twin Falls area she has a harder time finding some services that she could more easily access when she lived in Nampa. For instance, she used to be able to receive her needed steroid injections at one appointment at the Spine Institute of Idaho. At her clinic in Twin Falls, she has to schedule three separate appointments. 
She said the community only recently had counselors get certified to do eye movement desensitization and reprocessing, or EMDR, therapy, which was a treatment she received 10 years ago in the Treasure Valley.

 Idaho Medicaid patients are unsure of the future of their benefits, or what to do if they get cut

Each of the three Idahoans interviewed responded “I don’t know” when asked what they will do if their services get scaled back or cut entirely, but they all said they are worried. 
“This is something I’ve been thinking and dealing with a lot recently,” Rowe said. 
She said she knows her PT would get cut in about half and she could absorb smaller costs, such as her glasses, but things like pharmaceuticals may be too much. 
Seiler said “I don’t really know what would happen” and his wife responded, “It would be really hard to live your life. You’re already living with the bare minimum.”  
If the people utilizing home and community based services had to go into nursing homes, there wouldn’t be enough beds, said Leviton of the Independent Living Council. The nursing facility coverage is a mandatory benefit under Medicaid, but there are only about 6,000 beds statewide. 
“Where are you going to put these 20,000 people?” Leviton asked. 
Herbert said she would refuse to go to a nursing home, where she couldn’t take her beloved emotional support cat, whose full name is Destiny Angelle Herbert, and where she believes she wouldn’t receive as much care. 
She said she tried to meet with Idaho’s congressional delegation to urge them to oppose the cuts, but had little luck reaching them. 
“I wish they could be in my shoes,” she said of the congressmen. 
She said of President Donald Trump, whose major policy agenda was largely fulfilled in the legislation, “Maybe I should ask him if I can move in.”

(Photo by Spenser Heaps/For Utah News Dispatch)I can’t figure out which character Ryan Walters is playing. 
Is he the kid who sits in the back of the classroom, quietly sowing chaos by chunking nasty spitballs at his classmates and blaming someone else when he gets in trouble? 
Or is Oklahoma’s Republican state superintendent merely a well-intentioned but bumbling public official who hasn’t got a clue about how things actually work?
Those seem to be the simplest explanations behind Walters’ bizarre, ill-timed and unfunded attempt to require public schools to offer free breakfast and lunch to all students or face sanctions. Walters expects districts to pay for this using their existing budgets that are already feeling the pinch from the Trump administration’s decision to freeze upward of $70 million in planned funding.
State law also does not require districts to fund universal free meals. Lawmakers leave that decision to local school boards that set the budgets and spending priorities.
The idea of ensuring all students have free lunches is laudable on the surface. After all, state lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have filed various pieces of legislation in recent years that seeks to expand access to free meals. Supporters say it could help boost lagging outcomes because children can’t learn efficiently with hungry stomachs.
The problem is Walters’ approach is so inept that it makes you wonder if he doesn’t really want this to work. Maybe he just wants everyone around him to squirm so he can ultimately throw up his hands in feigned disgust and say: “I tried, but those evil, no good, woke school administrators and those liberal Republicans in the state Legislature stopped us from keeping more of your hard earned money in your pocket.”
Or something equally ridiculous. 
Walters, after all, is reportedly eyeing a gubernatorial bid in 2026, judging from ryanwaltersforgovernor.com, which says it is “launching soon.”
But if he truly wants this to happen, he’s signaling that he’s incompetent and not ready for the big time.
It’s no secret that the state and districts operate on a July 1 through June 30 fiscal cycle. Both have their annual budgets set by the end of June every year. Yet Walters waited until July 7 to announce his edict — days after the deadline had passed for eligible districts to apply to participate in a federal meal reimbursement program, and weeks after the Legislature determined its annual public school funding priorities. Universal free school lunches were not one.
Walters apparently has no idea — nor a care for — what providing free lunches is going to cost. He’s insistent that districts have enough existing money to pay for it through things like reduced administrative costs. That argument conveniently ignores that little pesky state law that limits administrative spending to no more than 5% of yearly spending. Some district leaders have said even if they eliminate all administrative jobs, they’ll still be short of needed funding and will have to increase class sizes and eliminate teachers.
Walters’ elected position leading our state’s public educational system affords him the opportunity before every legislative session to outline his priorities and ask for funding. What did he choose this year? Issues like Bibles and guns, not universal school meals. 
If this was such a big deal, why not prioritize it then?
And for a guy who screams until he’s red in the face about administrative bloat, Walters has plenty of that in his own backyard. Don’t forget that he paid out nearly $600,000 in end-of-year bonuses to his state education department staff last year. Just imagine how many lunches that money could have bought.  
The unfortunate thing is that families are struggling with inflation and seemingly endless rising food costs. Meanwhile, companies contracted with school districts profit from being able to slap on unnecessary fees to our children’s lunch tabs. 
My kids don’t qualify for free or reduced-price lunches, but sometimes they want to eat pizza, chicken nuggets and mashed potatoes, and frito chili pie, so we fork out $3.80 per lunch. School meal costs are typically set by local boards and vary by district, but the School Nutrition Association reported typical lunch prices ranged from $2.95 to $3.20 last school year depending on age. Those might seem like a small pittance, but over time it adds up, so we limit how often they can eat cafeteria food.
As a parent, I found myself irked last year when my children’s district capped the amount of money parents could contribute to their meal account at $100 per transaction while at the same time allowing their vendor to charge a several dollar “transaction fee” each time I added money. That cap meant families with multiple children paid more in fees because they had to make more frequent contributions. I was so irritated I called the district and the vendor and emailed my local school board member to complain.
I thought it was a reasonable request to put more money into their lunch accounts so I could pay less in transaction fees.
To his credit, my elected official responded swiftly and told me that my frustration is one that his family has experienced also. He was told the vendor would raise the fee for everyone if the dollar limit is increased.
The school district ultimately told me I could avoid the fee by writing a check in whatever amount I wanted to the school cafeteria, which is what I’ve done since.
Judging by the bipartisan groundswell of support for Walters’ plan on social media, families want lawmakers to help lessen the burden of school meal costs, and Republican legislators’ days of ignoring the issue are at an end. Their constituents want them to take action.
The right way – and not cheap shots for political gain.
That means going through the legislative process and allocating money to pay for it, not expecting districts to eat the costs or slashing funding in other areas.
What we don’t need is Walters hurling spitballs like a class clown who damages local schools and children’s education. 
One thing is clear: Getting this plan across the finish line will require someone who has the motivation to see this through.
Walters started this food fight. Now voters will see if he has the leadership skills to finish it.

(Photo by Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate districts by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seatsand 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.


In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.


In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.


In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.

There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.

Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

Silver Stream Farm sits on a windy rim at nearly 8,000 feet. By tapping into advanced indoor technology, it grows climate-controlled crops of berries, tomatoes and vegetables. 
The post Year-round strawberries in Wyoming? Welcome to Pinedale’s indoor farm. appeared first on WyoFile .","SUBLETTE COUNTY—None of the traditional trappings of farm life greet visitors to this windy rim north of Pinedale. 
No crops waving in field rows, no sounds of cows lowing, no odors of animal manure lacing the air, no mud to wipe off your boots. 
That’s because this operation is far from traditional. Silver Stream Farm is located entirely within five large grow houses tucked off Highway 191. Inside the buildings, the farm utilizes 25,000 square feet of space rigged with high-tech sensors, overhead misters, climate controls and nutrient pumps to grow an abundance of produce unexpected for this harsh corner of Wyoming. 
Zucchini plants dangle from the ceiling and dark-green basil grows in hydroponic pods. Kale leaves unfurl in dense patches, arugula seedlings sprout in trays and an entire 5,000-square-foot grow house is dedicated to strawberries. In there, rows and rows of the fragaria plants produce the distinctive white flowers and red berries. 
And because they are protected from harsh temperatures and fed by grow lights, the berries, lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes and other crops are in rotation year-round.
Silver Stream Farm, which rebranded this spring following a fivefold expansion, aims to supplement local production for communities in a corner of the state where most food is trucked in from long distances.

“The goal is to create just a really robust local food system,” said Chief Operating Officer Nicci Hammerel, by touching “as many households as we can.”
The farm may not have the capacity to feed the entire region. But what it does possess is exemplified by what Hammerel offers next. “Try one,” she said, holding out a container of cherry tomatoes, ripe and ready to eat on an early summer day when many outdoor tomato plants in Wyoming have yet to even produce flowers. 
High-tech agriculture
Farms aren’t known for their cleanliness. They rely on dirt, after all, and dirt is, well, dirty. But there’s also a quality of unruliness inherent to many small farms, with encroaching weeds and plants gone to seed, chickens pecking around a yard or green matter shoveled into compost piles. 
Inside the grow houses of Silver Stream Farm, however, plants grow in orderly rows, floors are spotless and equipment is almost clinically clean.
“I want to be able to eat off the floor,” farm manager LeeAnn Shelton joked. She had just taken a break from pruning strawberries — methodically trimming off smaller buds to encourage the plants to grow fewer, bigger berries.

The tidiness is something she and her husband, Cooper Shelton, have been dialing in since the project launched four years ago.  
Shelton grew up in a farming family in North Carolina. She and Cooper, who is also from North Carolina, moved to the Jackson area for the outdoor amenities in 2018. They both worked in hospitality, though they missed the gardening traditions they had grown up with. 
They became involved with Silver Stream around 2021 when the farm’s original owner, entrepreneur and philanthropist Dakin Sloss, asked if they were interested in a garden project. Sloss wanted to do something about the local food desert in northern Sublette County.
The project started with a single grow house and a much longer name — Satchitananda Farm. In the early days, LeeAnn mostly tended the plants while Cooper, who attended college for engineering, focused on dialing in the technologies. 
“We were plant people, and we became systems people,” she said, noting that several years in, it’s become “a heck of a garden project.”
They sold vegetables to their first customers in 2022, and have been refining their methods since. 
Sensors, pipes and gauges help feed and water the indoor crops at Silver Stream Farm near Pinedale. (Katie Klingsporn/WyoFile) 
A computerized system monitors and pampers the crops. Sensors gauge the hydroponic plants, and pump the right mix of nutrients and fertilizer into the irrigation water to feed them. Water recirculates from misters above to drains beneath the plants. Climate-controlled buildings meet the temperature and humidity preferences of the crops in them. The well water is even brought to room temperature so as not to shock the plants. 
“It’s pretty advanced,” Hammerel said. 
The operation isn’t entirely divorced from nature; employees introduce insects like ladybugs and wasps to help with pests and pollination. 
Until this spring, however, the husband-and-wife team operated out of a single greenhouse. Growing a variety of crops all in the same climate zone comes with challenges. Melons, for example, thrive in different conditions than kale. 
The expansion 
These types of indoor agriculture projects are typically done on a larger scale and in friendlier climates, Shelton said. The original Pinedale operation was unique in its size and surrounding conditions. 
“We’ve seen it be negative 45 [degrees], and we’ve seen it be 95 [degrees],” she said. “We’ve kind of just tried to baby this building along.” 
By experimenting and perfecting, the Sheltons established a proof of concept, Hammerel said. So this spring, the farm added four new grow houses. It was a huge investment that quintupled the farm’s capacity and allowed the growers to divide their crops into five distinct zones. The farm also hired five new employees to work alongside the Sheltons.

The growth has allowed them to improve even more, Shelton said, by setting each climate to match the plants it grows. “It’s really been awesome to just see everything booming.”
Crops range from traditional market produce like lettuce, fennel, cabbage, broccoli, squash, herbs, melons, edible flowers and carrots. The farm also experiments with more exotic varieties, like ginger and mangos.
On the business side, the newly rebranded farm is focused on recalibrating based on its new capacity, Hammerel and Shelton said. 
“Our client base is expanding and expanding and changing, so learning from them what they like, what they want,” Shelton said. 
The overarching goal is to get fresh, local food into as many households as possible. Food retains both flavor and nutrition better when it doesn’t need to be shipped thousands of miles, Hammerel said. 
Silver Stream has more than 70 subscribers to its Community Supported Agriculture service — a model where customers pay in advance for weekly boxes of produce. The farm also sells at farmers markets in Jackson and Bondurant, Hungry Jack’s General Store in Wilson and a few restaurants. Customers can order produce online and pick it up in regional locations.

Silver Stream was one of two Wyoming farms to win a 2025 pilot grant from Wyoming’s Department of Family Services and Food Works Group aimed at strengthening food production and access. The $39,000 grant subsidizes the cost of the fresh produce Silver Stream grows for regional food banks. 
The farm also intended to participate in the Wyoming Farm to School program — but the program will not continue past its current cycle due to federal cuts. 
House grown
Back in the main house, staffers fill boxes for CSA orders and plant seeds for the next cycle of microgreens. Around noon, they break for lunch — one of the regular potluck-style meals they share. 
On the menu today: burgers made with beef from a neighboring ranch alongside a cucumber and tomato salad. Topping the burgers are thickly sliced heirloom tomatoes, lettuce and sweet pickles one of the employees made. 
All the veggies are, of course, courtesy of the grow houses.

Relations between the two countries have been strained since Trump signed an executive order in February that claimed white South Africans are the victims of government land confiscation and race-based “genocide,” while admitting some of those Afrikaners as refugees to the United States. Trump also halted all foreign aid to South Africa and expelled the country’s Ambassador to the U.S., Ebrahim Rasool. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.
Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

Pete Ricketts has joined the likes of Ted Turner and Bill Gates as a well-heeled businessman buying large plots of land in Nebraska.
Like those purchases, there’s concern it might result in higher property taxes for neighbors, though a Dawes County commissioner calls those concerns unfounded.
Ricketts, whose net worth is estimated at $182 million by the investment research website Quiver Qualitative, bought nearly 3,459 acres in the scenic Pine Ridge area of northwest Nebraska in December for $7.45 million.

The purchase, which averaged $2,154 per acre, involved two groups of land once owned by a Wahoo businessman, Dan Kreitman, whom Ricketts had appointed to the Nebraska Game and Parks Commission in 2016. One parcel is just east of Chadron State Park. The second is just west of East Ash Road.
Both parcels are in the scenic Pine Ridge area of Nebraska, south and southwest of Chadron in Dawes County. It is rugged canyon land known for strong populations of deer and turkey, and even some elk and mountain lions. Part of the land the senator purchased was burned during wildfires over the past 20 years, leaving behind lots of blackened trees and newly restored grassland.
Ricketts, who enjoys turkey and deer hunting, purchased the land for recreational purposes, according to a realtor with knowledge of the sale. His father, Joe, raises bison on land he owns. There was no indication that Pete will be raising livestock on the new land.
Messages sent to Ricketts’ senate office seeking comment did not result in a response by Friday.

While past purchases of Nebraska ranch land by Turner, the founder of CNN, and acquisition of farmland by Gates, the Microsoft billionaire, raised the ire of some nearby landowners, a former Chadron radio news director said feelings might be different with Ricketts’ purchase because he’s from Nebraska and is a former governor.
“He’s not an outsider,” said John Axtell, a longtime Chadron-area radio news and sports reporter who is now retired.
Dawes County Commissioner Jake Stewart, who owns Pine Ridge ranch property not far from the Ricketts land, said the purchase is considered a “private sale” — one not used to set property values for nearby land — that should not impact property valuations and property taxes for neighbors.
The price paid by Ricketts, $2,154 per acre, is higher than the average price for all property in northwest Nebraska of $965 an acre, according to a report this year by the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Center for Agriculture Profitability. The average price paid for non-tillable grazing land, which is most of what Ricketts bought, was $630 an acre.
But the price for so-called “recreational land” that provides a private hunting preserve can go much higher. Current listings for such property in the Pine Ridge can leap above $4,000 — to as high as $12,000 an acre.

Ricketts, when governor, proclaimed that Nebraska was the “best destination in the United States” for turkey hunting. Besides that, he posted photographs of deer hunts, and the Pine Ridge is known for its ample populations of mule deer and wild turkeys.
“Land in the Pine Ridge is prized by big-game hunters, regardless of whether they’re rich or poor,” said a veteran western Nebraska realtor, who asked not to be named to avoid upsetting clients. “It’s one of the last wild places in the United States.”
There also are likely some mountain lions on Ricketts’ land. In 2020, the Lincoln Journal Star wrote a story about Kreitman shooting a deer on his Pine Ridge ranch land, but when he located the animal, a mountain lion had already begun feeding on it.
Gates, according to a Flatwater Free Press story in 2024, owns 20,000 acres of farmland across 19 counties in Nebraska. But most of Gates’ holdings are tillable farmland in eastern Nebraska, not rocky outcroppings in the Pine Ridge.
In 2018, the Omaha World-Herald reported that Turner owned approximately 500,000 acres of ranch land, mostly in the Sand Hills region of the state, where he raises bison.
John Malone, who made billions in running telecom companies including Liberty Media, also is a major owner of Nebraska property, according to the realtor interviewed by the Examiner.
So, said Axtell, the former radio reporter, Ricketts’ purchase in the Pine Ridge area pales by comparison.

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)At least a quarter of hospitals in seven states closed their obstetric services between 2010 and 2022, according to a new study in the journal Health Affairs. And in six states, more than 60% of hospitals lacked obstetrics by 2022.
Using data from the American Hospital Association and federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the researchers analyzed obstetric services, which is the branch of medicine focused on pregnancy, childbirth, and the postpartum period, at short-term acute care hospitals between 2010 and 2022.
The study included 4,964 hospitals.
Rural states saw the most profound losses. The states with the highest percentage of all hospitals lacking obstetrics by 2022 were: North Dakota (73%), Oklahoma (63%), West Virginia (62%), Louisiana (60%), South Dakota (60%) and Mississippi (60%).
Idaho banned abortion. Three years later, minors and seniors struggle to get routine care.

 
The study sheds further light on the nation’s growing maternity health care deserts. At 18.6 per 100,000 live births, the U.S. has a maternal mortality rate far higher than other high-income nations. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 80% of maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable.
The “steady march of closures” has been an ongoing problem, said Katy Kozhimannil, University of Minnesota professor and lead author of the study.
Hospital leaders and experts have warned that Congress’ Medicaid cuts could have a ripple effect, leading to many hospitals no longer able to afford their labor and delivery units, which are expensive to maintain.

“Those programs are a primary source of support for maternity care,” Kozhimannil said. “Without changes to maternity care financing and organization, I expect that the trends that we have seen over the past couple of decades will likely continue.”
A dozen states saw a quarter or more losses of obstetric services among hospitals in rural counties, the study found.
Across rural counties in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, close to half of hospitals — 46% — lost obstetrics between 2010 and 2022.
Those two states saw the highest percentage of hospitals losing obstetrics, followed by West Virginia (about 43%), Florida (40%) and Iowa (nearly 40%).

Along with Washington, D.C., urban counties in four states — Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma  and Rhode Island — saw at least a quarter of hospitals lose obstetrics.
By 2022, two-thirds of rural hospitals in eight states (Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia) were without obstetric services.
Three states — Delaware, Utah and Vermont — had no obstetric losses between 2010 and 2022, the authors wrote.

(Photo courtesy of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting)Efforts to rescind $1.1 billion previously approved by Congress for public media could have a devastating effect on a decades-old Arkansas film festival, according to its executive director. 
Now in its 34th year, the Hot Springs Documentary Film Festival is the longest-running documentary film festival in North America and one of two film festivals that could lose funding if federal lawmakers approve a rescissions request from President Donald Trump that would claw back federal funding for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting for fiscal years 2026 and 2027. 
Ken Jacobson, executive director of the Hot Springs Documentary Film Institute, said the cuts would affect the nine-day festival as a whole, but its Filmmaker Forum, now in its third year, “would be devastated” because the program receives the majority of its funding from a $160,000 CPB grant. 
Brad Burleson debuted his first short film at the festival last year and called the forum “a game changer” that has “completely shaped” his journey. The Hot Springs filmmaker and festival board member said the forum is an affordable way to connect local filmmakers to the broader documentary community without the expense of traveling to larger coastal cities. 
Through the forum’s 15-minute one-on-one meetings with industry professionals, Burleson met CPB and National Endowment for the Arts representatives who shared information about resources and advice on how to market his film, Tippi & Barb. 
The 12-minute documentary tells the story of how state Rep. Tippi McCullough, a retired teacher and Arkansas’ only openly gay state lawmaker, was fired from a Catholic school for marrying her wife.

In addition to its $160,000 CPB grant, the Hot Springs festival gets $20,000 from PBS, which also receives CPB funding, Jacobson said. The combined amount represents about 29% of the festival’s nearly $650,000 annual operating budget.
In fiscal year 2024, Arkansas received nearly $3.2 million in CPB funding, according to CPB’s budget request. Arkansas PBS received nearly $2.5 million, and roughly $545,300 was split between three National Public Radio stations. 
Cuts to these institutions could also affect the festival because of partnerships between them, Jacobson said. Little Rock Public Radio helps promote the festival, while Arkansas PBS works with the nonprofit on an emerging filmmakers program.
“The cutting of CPB funding, it doesn’t just turn off PBS, it turns off a pipeline for storytellers,” Burleson said. 
Rescissions Act
The CPB cuts are part of the larger Recissions Act of 2025 that would revoke $9.4 billion in previously approved funding for public media and foreign aid programs. The U.S. House approved the measure by two votes in June, marking only the third time in decades that the House has voted to claw back funding that lawmakers had already agreed to spend. 
The U.S. Senate must vote on the rescissions request by Friday for it to take effect. 
Jacobson shared his concerns about the bill with 4th District Congressman Rep. Bruce Westerman, who represents Hot Springs. Two weeks after all four of Arkansas’ representatives voted for the measure, Westerman said in a letter to Jacobson that although Arkansas PBS receives about 11% of its funding from CPB, the loss of those funds shouldn’t threaten the state’s public broadcasting services because of its diversified funding model. 
“There’s no easy or feel-good answer here. I believe there are other federal programs more appropriate for reductions than CPB,” Westerman wrote. “That said, our nation’s fiscal path is unsustainable, and serious steps must be taken to rein in spending. Please know, I will keep your thoughts in mind should any future legislation regarding the CPB come to the House Floor.”
Although Jacobson found Westerman’s reluctance encouraging, he said “we need our representatives to step up and act accordingly” unless they want to see negative impacts in Arkansas.
Like Arkansas PBS, the documentary festival has a diverse revenue stream that includes ticket sales, corporate sponsorships, individual donations and grants from other organizations like the National Endowment for the Arts, which Trump recommended eliminating in his 2026 Discretionary Budget Request. The NEA has also cancelled grants this year to various groups.










The amount of culture and the types of films that are brought into Hot Springs, this doesn’t exist. This is such an anomaly to have such great talent, to have so many diverse films that range the spectrum brought into our little town in the South.


– Hot Springs filmmaker Brad Burleson


The Hot Springs Film Festival received a termination letter for a $40,000 NEA grant awarded in late 2024. The nonprofit eventually received the full amount, but Jacobson said others weren’t so lucky. 
The Trump administration’s threats to grant funding have been “upsetting” because organizations go through a long process of applications and vetting to earn these grants — they’re not just automatically given, he said.
“It seems like it should have been a done deal. So then to hear in January that the administration was planning to cancel the vast majority of those grants, it is kind of a slap in the face not just to organizations like ours, but to the process itself,” Jacobson said. 
The elimination of federal funding can have a ripple effect because several grant-funded organizations work together.
Burleson, for example, honed his filmmaking skills by taking classes offered by Low Key Arts, which were funded by NEA and the Arkansas Arts Council. The nonprofit partnered with the film festival last year to offer a documentary workshop, which allowed Burleson to create his first film. 
US Senate GOP under pressure on Trump demand to defund NPR, PBS, foreign aid

There’s a lot of momentum in Arkansas filmmaking that’s driven by access to resources like the Filmmaker’s Forum, and losing federal funds diminishes that growth, Burleson said. 
“This isn’t just about art,” he said. “In so many people’s minds this is an extracurricular activity, [but] this is something that teaches people how to tell Southern stories and really promotes the Southern storytelling.”
Since attending the festival for the first time in 2010, Burleson said he’s “gone religiously,” often taking off work for the entire week to attend what he considers a unique event. 
“The amount of culture and the types of films that are brought into Hot Springs, this doesn’t exist,” Burleson said. “This is such an anomaly to have such great talent, to have so many diverse films that range the spectrum brought into our little town in the South.”
Beyond making documentaries accessible to local audiences and filmmakers, Jacobson said the festival is a boon for the local economy because guests stay at hotels and patronize local businesses. 
“All of that economic engine will be stalled if this much valued arts organization is forced to cut back,” he said. 
Jacobson said he’s started thinking about how he might cope with potential cuts next year by shortening the nine-day festival, eliminating programs or reducing travel budgets for high-profile guests. 
For now, staff is busy preparing for this year’s festival, which is scheduled for Oct. 10-18. More information is available at www.hsdfi.org.

Every other Sunday from 8 p.m. to 8 a.m., Raquel Lane-Arellano waits for calls from people across Colorado who may have spotted Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents. She has been volunteering for six years, but the first time her phone rang was in January. Now, for those 12 hours twice a month, the ringing rarely stops. 
Once she gets a call, Lane-Arellano confirms the location with the often shaky voice on the other end of the phone. Then she notifies other volunteers, who drive out to the area. Their job is to determine whether the sighting is legitimate, document the scene, speak to locals and hand out “Know Your Rights” cards, but not to physically confront the agents.
Lane-Arellano volunteers as a dispatcher for a 24/7 hotline run by the Colorado Rapid Response Network, a coalition of immigration, religious and legal nonprofits. The network was founded in 2017 to document reported ICE sightings and has amassed about 3,000 volunteers across the state, according to organizers.
“The purpose is to make sure people have the facts and that we try to dissuade some fear,” said Lane-Arellano, who is also the communications manager for the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition. “Because what the Trump administration wants is for our people to be afraid all the time.”

The network’s member organizations include the ACLU Colorado, American Friends Service Committee, Mi Familia Vota and Together Colorado. The statewide hotline is the first of its kind in Colorado, and it also covers southern Wyoming, according to organizers. Its operations are similar to statewide ICE reporting hotlines in Oregon, Connecticut and New Jersey, as well as local hotlines in cities like Los Angeles and Detroit. 
The Rapid Response Network has seen both hotline calls and volunteer interest skyrocket since President Donald Trump took office for his second term, due to an uptick in immigration enforcement. Colorado is a particular focus of Trump’s push for mass deportations, and he has singled out Aurora for enforcement operations.
Between Trump’s inauguration and mid-June, ICE arrests in Colorado have nearly quadrupled compared to the same period last year, according to ICE data obtained by UC Berkeley researchers. The researchers found that 1,360 people have been arrested by ICE in Colorado under the second Trump administration, and many have no criminal record. The Colorado ICE data shows more than 400 arrested people marked as “other immigration violator,” as opposed to “convicted criminal” or “pending criminal charges.”
One of those arrests was of prominent immigrant rights advocate Jeanette Vizguerra, who has lived in the U.S. since 1997 and is currently in ICE detention. Her lawyers have alleged in federal court that her arrest was in retaliation for protected speech.
The administration’s immigration crackdown received a major funding boost through the Republican tax break and spending cut bill that Trump signed earlier this month. The bill devotes $170 billion to border security, immigration enforcement and the hiring of thousands more ICE agents, among other Trump priorities. 
Network at odds with ICE
The Rapid Response Network calls its volunteers who approach and document areas with a reported ICE presence “confirmers.” These volunteers undergo a confirmer training. The network advises noncitizens against becoming confirmers due to the risks of entering areas where ICE might be conducting raids. 
Andrea Loya serves as the director of the immigrant support nonprofit Casa De Paz, but outside of work she also volunteers as a confirmer. In her six months volunteering, she has gone out more than 10 times, and she said each situation is unique.
Each time she gets a call from a dispatcher, she grabs a megaphone, flyers with immigrant rights information and her phone. During her outings, she remains in frequent communication with other network volunteers to ensure they know she is safe, and so they can post social media updates about whether ICE is in fact present at the reported location. Loya said she has never spoken to ICE agents, and she keeps her distance while around them.
Loya characterized the role of the network as that of a neighborhood watch group: to document unwanted activities and inform residents.
“It’s important for us to counter the narrative that what we’re doing is illegal,” Loya said. “It’s just a neighborhood watch, the kind of thing people have been doing for years. When you enter really nice neighborhoods and park there, people come up and ask you what you’re doing. That’s what we’re doing, but in our communities.”










It’s just a neighborhood watch, the kind of thing people have been doing for years. When you enter really nice neighborhoods and park there, people come up and ask you what you’re doing. That’s what we’re doing, but in our communities.


– Andrea Loya, Colorado Rapid Response Network volunteer


The Department of Homeland Security and ICE’s Denver field office have condemned the network for allegedly interfering with immigration enforcement operations. Representatives of the Denver field office declined an interview request for this story.
“Groups like this interfere with ICE’s ability to keep communities safe,” the Denver field office said in a statement.
The Denver field office said that it conducted an operation in Longmont on June 20 to apprehend a child rapist, adding that it was disrupted by Rapid Response Network members. 
ICE Denver declined to specify the way in which the Rapid Response Network interfered, and did not comment on whether there were any physical or verbal altercations between agents and network volunteers. ICE said on social media that the raid targeted a man from El Salvador who is wanted in Italy but has provided no warrant or other evidence to show that the raid was indeed focused on that man, or that he was in Longmont.
In a June 25 statement, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the network and its members “disrupt ICE operations targeting dangerous criminal illegal aliens.”
Jennifer Piper, a longtime leader in the Rapid Response Network, was dispatching calls on June 20. She said a group of volunteer confirmers drove to the Longmont location and talked to community members about their rights but did not confront or otherwise interfere with ICE. 
“This (incident) invited hundreds of people to try to troll our hotline, which was unsuccessful,” Piper said. “But this is an administration that has put out a bunch of misinformation and propaganda. We are just trying to get the best information possible out to our community.”
Combating fear
Lane-Arellano said that documenting instances when ICE isn’t present in a community is just as important as documenting when immigration agents are present. That’s because fear has permeated throughout Colorado immigrant communities, and it’s crucial to help her neighbors regain a level of security, she said. 
Every white van or law enforcement uniform can signal potential ICE presence to people who fear deportation, especially due to ICE tactics of using unmarked vehicles and arresting many non-criminals, she added.
“We show people what’s actually happening, and I think that’s really valuable so that there’s not needless fear,” Lane-Arellano said. “(ICE is) trying to silence that kind of work, and they want to criminalize that kind of work. I think people should be really concerned when there’s a government entity that’s just never held accountable, and is trying to minimize their public scrutiny.”

Some of the network’s volunteers attended a July 7 protest calling for closure of the ICE detention center is Aurora, which is operated by private prison firm GEO Group. Vizguerra has been detained there for four months.
Vizguerra’s daughter, Luna Báez, joined demonstrators. While protests and social media posts bring attention to the plight of detainees, Báez said allies of immigrants should also focus on other supportive steps — such as donating to nonprofits, providing translation services and volunteering with the Rapid Response Network. 
“It’s all about direct action,” Báez said. “You have to get uncomfortable to dismantle these systems of oppression.”
Denver resident Deb Schaffer attended the protest and also volunteers as a confirmer with the network. So far, she has gone out on about eight calls. 
“It’s a way to support people in the immigrant community and have a way to be helpful, and it’s a way to be someone that’s proud to live in Colorado,” Schaffer said. “We’re doing that together.”
Volunteering with the network can take a mental health toll, because of how intense and heartbreaking the calls can be, Lane-Arellano said. She remembers a 7 a.m. call she received from a Denver-area preschool principal who was concerned about ICE nearby and who said parents were too afraid to exit their cars with their children. 
The network sent out a confirmer who verified that the sighting was actually a local law enforcement agency, and the confirmation that it was a false alarm helped the preschool return to normal. 
But that call, and those terrified parents and kids, have stuck with Lane-Arellano. 
“It can be painful, but I do it anyway because of the goodness of everyday people,” Lane-Arellano said. “When it feels like there’s so much hate and cruelty at the federal level, it helps knowing that this isn’t what we stand for, and knowing that there’s so many people who are willing to put their own person on the line to support our community.”

(Photo: John Partipilo/Tennessee Lookout)One month after Nashville officials turned over a trove of documents to two Congressional committees probing the mayor’s response to immigration raids, the workings of the federal investigations remain opaque.
Representatives of Republicans on the House Judiciary and Homeland Security Committees, including Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles, have declined or ignored requests for updates and information. 
A spokesperson for the Homeland Security Committee’s Democratic members said he was unaware of any ongoing investigation. “Democrats are not participating alongside Republicans,” he said. 
Meanwhile, Mayor Freddie O’Connell has made no changes to a policy requiring the prompt reporting of all interactions between city employees and immigration officials that initially drew Republican ire.
“Departments continue to timely report information in compliance with the EO,” said Alex Apple, a spokesperson, citing a standing executive order. 
Congressional committees demand records from Nashville mayor on immigration enforcement

Thus far, the city has turned over about 100 documents in response to the probe. About half are terse narrative descriptions of contacts with the city initiated by Immigration and Customs and Enforcement, or ICE, and U.S. Homeland Security officials this year that have already been publicly posted, a review of records sent to Congress by the Lookout found. 
Other documents include emails describing the mayor’s policy requiring reporting of these interactions.
An additional seven interactions between city officials and federal immigration authorities have taken place since the last public release of information, Apple said. 
Four occurred in late June and three occurred last week, he said. They have yet to be made public as city officials go through a redaction process to remove individual identifying information, he said.
Nashville raids prompt scrutiny of mayor’s response
Scrutiny of Nashville Mayor Freddie O’Connell by Ogles and members of the Trump Administration began in the weeks after the Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE collaborated to conduct immigration stops over two days in May in South Nashville, a bustling neighborhood that is home to many in the city’s diverse immigrant communities. 
The raids took city officials by surprise, and they prompted immediate questions from local advocates and city council members about whether Nashville police or other officials had also cooperated. 
The mayor’s office denied any cooperation in the effort, which swept up 196 of the city’s immigrant residents in what federal officials described as a “targeted enforcement operation. Of the individuals arrested, 96 had prior criminal convictions and 31 had reentered the U.S. illegally after being deported, a press release from ICE said. 
In response to the raids, O’Connell updated a longstanding executive order issued by a predecessor requiring the city’s emergency and nonemergency personnel to report interactions with federal immigration officials. 
Emergency officials, including police, fire, emergency management and emergency communications, now must report such contacts within 24 hours, instead of three days. 
O’Connell also publicized a “belonging fund” established in a partnership between the city and the Community Foundation of Middle Tennessee to offer emergency aid to immigrants, including those left behind after a loved one’s detention by ICE.

“What’s clear today is that people who do not share our values of safety and community have the authority to cause deep community harm,” O’Connell said of the raids. 
O’Connell’s stance drew immediate pushback. Ogles, who represents a portion of Nashville, announced twin investigations by the Congressional Homeland Security and Judiciary committees into whether O’Connell’s actions obstructed the work of immigration officials. 
White House border czar Tom Homan pledged to “flood the zone” with additional immigration raids in Nashville in retaliation, saying O’Connell is “not going to stop us.”
“It certainly looks like Mayor O’Connell was involved in some sort of obstruction or the harboring of criminal illegal aliens in the great city of Nashville,” Tricia McLaughlin said in a media interview posted on the official X account of the Department of Homeland Security.
Trump administration officials accused O’Connell of “doxing” federal agents in publishing several of their names in its publicly-posted list of interactions with ICE. 
O’Connell has said the public posting of public officials’ names was inadvertent and his office has since redacted them.
O’Connell’s actions in ordering reports of ICE activity “does not interfere with federal law enforcement operations,” read a June 13 letter from attorneys for the mayor’s office to the chairs of House Homeland Security and Judiciary committees.
“It does not prohibit Metro employees from speaking with federal immigration officials; nor does it put any conditions on these communications other than requiring Metro employees report communication,” the letter said.

Patrick Morrisey has not backed down from his January executive order loosening the state’s strong school vaccine laws by allowing religious and philosophical exemptions for the shots. 
At a news conference last month, Morrisey said his administration is not aware of “one shred of evidence” that the state allowing religious exemptions would have negative consequences on residents’ health. 
“We’re not aware of one shred of evidence that by moving to be a state that respects religious liberty and exemption, that there is any negative public health effect,” Morrisey said June 24. “I dare the other side to provide that. They’re misleading you. We’re going to tell the truth.”
The executive order is based on the 2023 “Equal Protection for Religion Act.” Lawmakers this year voted down Senate Bill 460, which would have set the religious exemptions in state code. Morrisey maintains that the religious freedom law should give families the freedom not to vaccinate their kids if they choose to; he says his January executive order is merely an interpretation of that law.
Morrisey told a reporter that statistics show that in states that allow religious exemptions, the number of people who get religious exemptions for vaccines is not big enough to affect herd immunity, the resistance to infectious disease a community with a high rate of vaccination has. 
But public health experts, including one of the state’s former health officers, disagree with the governor’s assertion. They say areas with looser school vaccine laws are more likely to have disease outbreaks.
“There is overwhelming evidence that vaccine exemption policies reduce vaccination coverage rates and increase the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases,” Richard Hughes, a George Washington University law professor and vaccine law expert, wrote in a statement to West Virginia Watch. He said Morrisey’s claim disregards “decades of public health research.”
Hughes pointed to a 2010 medical study in California that found that areas of high non-medical exemptions were 2.5 times more likely to have outbreaks of pertussis, also known as whooping cough, than those with lower non-medical exemptions.
Another analysis estimated that a state with easier nonmedical vaccine exemption procedures is nearly twice as likely to experience a measles outbreak compared with states with more difficult exemption policies.
“The public health evidence is clear: well-designed vaccine exemption policies can help protect child health by maintaining high immunization coverage, preventing outbreaks, and protecting vulnerable children who cannot be vaccinated for valid medical reasons,” Hughes said. 
“This is not just about religious liberty. It’s about whether one official can unilaterally weaken a system that has long protected the health of all children in the state,” Hughes said. 
West Virginia currently does not have a health officer. State Secretary of Health Arvin Singh appeared at the governor’s news conference and spoke in support of religious exemptions. Singh said that the executive order “ensures that people of faith are not punished for making personal, prayerful decisions about their children’s health.”
Singh, who has a Master of Science in health care leadership and a master’s degree in public health, said there’s not “meaningful evidence,” religious exemptions have led to an increase in disease incidence at the population level. 
He pointed to Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania as states that maintain 90% rates for school vaccinations while allowing religious exemptions. 
Data from the Ohio Department of Health indicate that 86% of kindergarten kids got all their required shots in the 2023-2024 school year. In Florida, that number was 88% in the 2023 school year. Pennsylvania kindergarteners had a 94% vaccination rate for measles during the 2024-2025 school year.
A spokeswoman for the state Department of Health said Singh was referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s elementary school data and clarified that he meant that Ohio and Florida were “nearly at the 90% immunization rate threshold.”
“West Virginia is a beautiful state filled with hard-working families who love their children, live their values and seek to do what’s right,” Singh said. “We should not be one of the only five states still denying parents their God-given right to make decisions of conscience.”
More than 140 non-medical exemptions approved so far 
All states require school students to be vaccinated against a series of infectious diseases. West Virginia has been one of only five in the country that do not allow religious or philosophical exemptions to those vaccines. 
As of last month, the state Department of Health said it had processed 140 religious exemptions for the 2025-2026 school year under Morrisey’s executive order. At 140, the number of exemptions would still be a tiny fraction of the total number of school age children in the state, estimated at more than 250,000.
By contrast, there were 53 requests for medical exemptions to school vaccine requirements made in 2023 — and only nine of those resulted in a permanent exemption. 
Dr. Steven Eshenaur, health officer and executive director of the Kanawha-Charleston Health Department, said Morrisey’s belief that non-medical exemptions will not affect the state’s herd immunity is just an assumption. He and other experts have pointed to the state’s low rate for preschool vaccinations as evidence that many parents wouldn’t have their children vaccinated unless they’re required to. 
According to 2021 data, the state has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country for children who are below school age. That year, about 57% of West Virginia three-year-olds got all of the recommended vaccinations. In 2023, 74% of West Virginia’s young children were vaccinated, according to KFF.
However, 98% of the state’s kindergarten children were vaccinated for measles during the 2023-2024 school year — higher than the national average of about 93%. Health experts say the state’s school vaccination laws are the reason for the higher rate of kindergarten vaccination. 
“West Virginia has one of the lowest preschool immunization rates in the country,” Eshenaur said. “If those parents don’t have to immunize their children [to enter kindergarten], we would be looking at a very large percentage of our children that are unimmunized or under immunized going into school.
“The assumption is that they will get immunized,” Eshenaur said. “The reality is that parents aren’t immunizing them now. So why would they if they don’t have to?”
Eshenaur, pointed to measles outbreaks in Ontario, Canada and in Texas, both of which allow religious exemptions. As of July 8, Texas reported 753 confirmed measles cases and two fatalities since late January. The Ontario outbreak has infected more than 2,000 people and killed an infant. Most of the cases are in those who are unvaccinated. 
‘You can’t look at just the statewide rate’
According to the CDC, as of last week, the U.S. reported 1,288 measles cases this year, the highest number in 33 years. 
West Virginia last year reported its first confirmed measles case in 15 years. Health experts at the time credited the state’s high vaccination rates as the reason the highly-infectious virus did not spread to others. 
“We know that when a number of children utilize a religious exemption, that it does set up that particular community or area or higher risk of a measles outbreak in particular, given how infectious it is, and we have witnessed that over this past year right here in the United States,” Eshenaur said. 
Dr. Cathy Slemp, who was the state health officer from 2002 to 2011 and again from 2018 to 2020, said the more nonmedical exemptions that are present in a community, the higher the risk of disease and outbreak, among the unvaccinated and in the broader community. 
  “… in general, the laxer the (nonmedical exemption) process, the more exemptions seen and the greater the disease risk,” she said. 
“Even a few cases or a single preventable outbreak have public health impact to those families and to public health and health care system costs of investigation and care,” Slemp said.
Nonmedical exemptions tend to cluster, Slemp said. One town or one school may have a high number of exemptions, leading to pockets of the population that have lower vaccination rates.
“You can’t look at just the statewide rate,” Slemp said. “It would really depend on that community and that school to look at the rates. So when we just look at a statewide rate, it doesn’t tell us the risk of individual communities.”
The vaccination rate needed to achieve “herd immunity” varies by disease. Herd immunity for measles, for instance, requires a 95% vaccination rate.
Morrisey’s comments came during a news conference announcing his support of a lawsuit filed in Raleigh County against the West Virginia Board of Education. The board voted to defy the governor’s executive order and instruct county boards of education to allow only medical exemptions to vaccine requirements.  
Slemp said the issue isn’t about having no evidence, but a question of what a society values.
“It’s a societal question of what freedoms we value most — individual parental choice or societal comfort knowing we’ve done the best we can to protect all, especially infants and others who don’t have the option of being protected by vaccines,” she said.  “We’re not looking at a return to prevaccine day levels of disease, but we can’t say there’s no impact. “

(Michael Achterling/North Dakota Monitor)The North Dakota Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation is working to add as many as 300 additional beds to its overburdened prison system over the next year.
“We’re literally trying to lift up about, as far as I’m concerned, four mini prisons across the state all in the same year,” Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation Director Colby Braun told lawmakers at a committee meeting last month.
The state prison system has had a population more than 200 inmates over capacity on average during the past roughly two years. It was 193 male inmates over capacity on average between July 2023 and May 2025, according to data presented at the meeting. The system averaged 31 female inmates over capacity during that same time frame, the data show.
The Legislature this year approved more than $37 million for the 2025-2027 budget cycle to provide immediate relief to prison overcrowding, including by building temporary shelters and  contracting space from jails. The money will also go toward a new reentry facility in northwest North Dakota.
North Dakota breaks ground on first prison designed for women, with focus on rehabilitation

The agency got a little over $8 million to purchase man camps to provide overflow housing within the Missouri River Correctional Center. The department anticipates it to house 72 to 96 inmates, said Michele Zander, chief financial officer for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. The $8 million would cover the housing units, an emergency generator, washers and dryers, technology costs and more.
While the agency is still in the process of procuring the buildings, it expects to have the facility open next summer or fall, according to Zander.
There would be an ongoing cost of about $1.3 million to cover staff and supplies for the temporary housing, officials said in a presentation to lawmakers earlier this year.
Another $27.4 million was set aside in the 2025-2027 budget to allow the agency to contract with county and regional jails for additional overflow housing.
This includes an agreement for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to staff and operate a new section of the Grand Forks Jail, which could provide between 60 and 72 beds, according to Zander. She said this change could take effect sometime this fall.
The agency also hopes to enter into a similar agreement with the Burleigh Morton Detention Center. That jail has an unused housing unit that could give the agency another up to 120 beds. 
The idea would be for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation to provide case management and behavioral health services, while the Burleigh Morton Detention Center would handle operations. Zander said the agreement is expected to take effect sometime early next year.
Contract negotiations are still in the works for those two projects, she said.
The department also received a $1.6 million appropriation to establish a 25-bed reentry center somewhere in northwest North Dakota — possibly Minot or Williston. Many incarcerated North Dakotans ultimately hope to return to the area after they wrap up their sentences, but they lack reentry options close to home, Zander said.
“This can cause extra hardship on residents that want to move back home,” she said in an email.
North Dakota prisons find extra inmate beds in county facilities amid overcrowding

Other funding earmarked for the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation this budget cycle will go toward building larger prison facilities. $35.6 million was set aside to finish construction of the Heart River Correctional Center, the state’s first prison designed for women. The facility, projected to cost about $166.8 million in total, will have 304 beds and is scheduled to open in fall of 2027.
The state also set aside $20 million to plan a new medium-security prison that’s expected to go next to the State Penitentiary.
The agency last month also provided lawmakers with an estimate for its cost overruns from the 2023-2025 budget cycle, which ended June 30. The 2025 Legislature approved the agency’s request for a deficiency appropriation to cover these costs.
The amount as of late June was expected to be about $11 million. The expenses largely stem from prison overcrowding, according to the agency.
The bulk of the deficiency — a little over $8 million — came from county and regional jails that the Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation previously contracted with to house inmates that state facilities don’t have room for.

(Wes Muller/Louisiana Illuminator)Gov. Jeff Landry and state lawmakers have put $31.7 million toward refurbishing the outside of the Louisiana State Capitol. 
The money, included in the annual state construction plan that took effect July 1, will be used to waterproof the Capitol’s exterior in order for it to undergo a thorough cleaning. 
“It is a symbol of Louisiana, and it’s one of the most visited state capitol buildings in the country,” Senate President Cameron Henry, R-Metairie, said. “We’re taking all the steps we need to waterproof it so it will last another 200 to 300 years.” 

Completed in 1932, Louisiana’s State Capitol is a classic example of the Art Deco design style popular at the time and also used for the Empire State Building in New York City. Its construction took just 14 months. The building was the brainchild of Huey Long, who was a U.S. senator at the time and would be buried on its grounds three years later after his assassination in a Capitol hallway. 

The state will have to find more money in future years to complete the waterproofing project. It is expected to total $113.9 million, according to Louisiana’s construction plan, 

Of the $31.7 million allocated this year, $21 million comes from general state funding and $700,000 from an account set up in 2023 for Capitol repairs. The state plans to borrow the other $10 million.

Today, miners are well informed about the risks surrounding uranium mining, and many steps are taken to protect workers from its effects.
However, during Tutt’s time, such precautions were not taken. He recounts that there was never any communication about risks surrounding uranium mining, and even basic safety measures like the distribution of work gloves were unknown during his time mining in Colorado. Unsurprisingly, Tutt and many of his coworkers would suffer from cancer or other ailments directly related to uranium mining activities.

Claudia Peterson was just 5 years old when she witnessed a large mushroom cloud rising about a hundred miles east of her southern Utah home. By the time she was 35, Claudia was a cancer survivor who had watched her father die of a brain tumor, her six-year-old daughter Bethany die after three years fighting neuroblastoma (a rare type of cancer which primarily affects young children), and her only sister Cathy die of skin cancer.
​Neither of these stories are simply anecdotes. Sarah Fox provides compelling evidence in her 2014 book “Downwind: A People’s History of the Nuclear West” that the Atomic Energy Commission, U.S. Public Health Service, and uranium mining companies all were aware of the serious health risks surrounding radiation poisoning resulting from uranium mining or nuclear bomb testing as early as 1951, but failed to inform miners or other citizens. It would be another 39 years until President George H.W. Bush would sign the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, or RECA,, into law, which finally gave compensation for those affected.
Across the states of Arizona, Nevada, and Utah, tens of thousands of people have claimed compensation from RECA. That’s because from 1945 to 1962, the U.S. performed 100 above-ground nuclear tests, which released massive amounts of radioactive fallout across the continental U.S. Frustratingly, the Atomic Energy Commission was the commission responsible for performing the tests and maintaining communication with the public about any potential risks from nuclear testing.
This led to a perverse cycle whereby many dangerous nuclear tests were performed with virtually no real public communication about said dangers. And the results were devastating: disproportionate cases of lung, stomach, thyroid, and other types of cancer; severe radiation effects on crops and livestock among a population which was made up of primarily subsistence farmers; many infants and children who died from cancer tied to radioactive isotopes that passed from their mother’s breast milk or cattle’s dairy into their lungs and stomach.
I do not have room here to recount more stories from individual downwinders. Thankfully, that project has been and will continue to be carried out by dedicated scholars like Fox. July 16 is the 80th anniversary of the first Trinity nuclear test. It is a good time for us all to reflect on the importance of government transparency. So long as the government is involved in a particular endeavor, it has the obligation to ensure that there are no serious public health risks from its activities. If there are any risks, the government has the obligation to tell its citizens so that they may vote, either with their feet or by the ballot.
The story of the downwinders is ugly, but it is an important commentary on the need for government transparency. If we fail to take such commentary seriously, we should not be surprised to read about many more George Tutts or Claudia Petersons in the future.

(Getty stock image)After more than a decade of legislative effort to curb the number of kids tried in adult court, Maryland is suddenly facing pressure from political and prosecutorial voices to expand laws automatically treating youths accused of crime as if they were grown ups. At the same time, Vincent Schiraldi — a nationally respected, data-driven leader — stepped down from his post as secretary of the state’s Department of Juvenile Services, declaring he would no longer be complicit in this practice that harms young people.
These two developments are not isolated; they reflect a troubling retreat from evidence and a dangerous reversion to the counterproductive fear-based policymaking of the 1990s.
We have both led major youth justice systems — in New York and California — and worked with leaders across the country to advance policies that actually reduce crime and improve outcomes for young people. What’s happening in Maryland is both familiar to us and deeply frustrating.
When reform begins to work, a few tragic cases are weaponized in the media to paint an entire system as broken, often sparking public panic. Politicians respond with harsh rhetoric, calls to “crack down,” and efforts to undo evidence-based progress.
Schiraldi has offered a powerful defense of the approach he brought to Maryland, which was grounded in decades of research showing that young people are more likely to succeed when held accountable in age-appropriate, rehabilitative systems, not adult jails or prisons. The data is unequivocal: Prosecuting youth as adults, instead of reducing crime, makes kids more likely to commit another, more serious offense and leads to worse long-term outcomes.

Maryland’s current laws charging children as adults are already among the most punitive in the nation. They strip judges of discretion and automatically move cases involving youth as young as 14 to adult court, often with no individualized assessment of maturity, trauma, or potential for rehabilitation. That flies in the face of everything we know about adolescent development, brain science and what really works to keep communities safe.
Let’s be clear: Keeping kids in the youth justice system is not about excusing harm. Accountability matters. But accountability and rehabilitation must go hand in hand in youth justice. True public safety depends on a system that helps young people build better futures, not one that destroys those futures before they have a chance to begin.
Under Schiraldi’s leadership, Maryland made good progress. Seventy-one percent of youth arrested in 2021 had no further contact with the system though 2024; 84% of kids with two prior contacts had no subsequent contact.  Statewide, during the first five months of 2025 the department received 29% fewer referrals for violent crime compared to the same period in 2024.
But you wouldn’t know about these successes from recent headlines. Instead, opponents focused on a handful of difficult cases, using them to stoke fear and justify rolling back change.
We have seen this story before: A tragedy occurs; the public demands action; and rather than look at the data, decision-makers fall back on punitive responses that look like a response, but which will not actually work. It’s easier than the hard, long-term work of building a just and effective system.
What’s at stake here is not just one official’s decision. It’s the future of youth justice in Maryland — and, by extension, the future of the kids and communities that system serves. It is also a dangerous precedent for the rest of the nation. After nearly two decades of declines in youth incarceration and crime, it would be a national tragedy to see the pendulum swing back toward harsher penalties for youth that were associated with higher levels of offending.
We urge Maryland’s leaders — and the public — to resist the politics of fear. Stick with the facts. Research shows that young people are far more likely to succeed when they are met with developmentally appropriate responses, community-based interventions, and second chances.
We also urge solidarity with leaders like Vinny Schiraldi, who take the risk of doing what’s right over what’s politically convenient. It is not easy to step away from a powerful role rather than compromise your values. We’ve both been there. And we know how vital it is that reformers feel supported when they act with courage.
Most of all, we urge people to remember: These are kids. Many of them have experienced trauma, poverty, neglect and systemic racism. They deserve consequences when they cause harm, yes — but they also deserve compassion, support and the opportunity to grow. Our job, as adults and as leaders, is to hold space for both.
Maryland has the tools to build a youth justice system that is smart, fair, and safe. Let’s not abandon that vision now.",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Scales-of-justice-1024x683-1.jpeg,,,2025-07-14 06:07:19.598159

Cada dos domingos, de 8 p.m. a 8 a.m., Raquel Lane-Arellano espera llamadas de personas en diferentes partes de Colorado que podrían haber visto a agentes del Servicio de Inmigración y Control de Aduanas, conocido como ICE. Lleva seis años trabajando como voluntaria, pero la primera vez que sonó su teléfono fue en enero. Ahora, durante esas 12 horas dos veces al mes, el teléfono rara vez deja de sonar.
Al recibir una llamada, Lane-Arellano confirma la ubicación con la voz, a menudo temblorosa, del otro lado del teléfono. Luego, notifica a otros voluntarios, quienes van a la ubicación para determinar si el avistamiento es legítimo y documentar la escena, hablar con los lugareños y repartir tarjetas con información sobre los derechos legales de los inmigrantes sin confrontar físicamente a los agentes.
Lane-Arellano es voluntaria como despachadora de una línea directa disponible las 24 horas, los 7 días de la semana, dirigida por la Red de Respuesta Rápida de Colorado, una coalición de organizaciones de inmigración, religiosas y legales. La red fue fundada en 2017 para documentar los avistamientos reportados por ICE y ha reunido a unos 3.000 voluntarios de diferentes partes del estado, según los organizadores.
“El objetivo es asegurarnos de que la gente tenga información y de que intentemos disipar el miedo”, dijo Lane-Arellano, quien también es gerente de comunicaciones de la Coalición por los Derechos de los Inmigrantes de Colorado. “Porque lo que la administración Trump quiere es que nuestra gente tenga miedo todo el tiempo”.

Las organizaciones miembros de la red incluyen la ACLU Colorado, el Comité de Servicio de Amigos Americanos, Mi Familia Vota y Together Colorado. La línea directa estatal es la primera de su tipo en Colorado y también cubre el sur de Wyoming, según los organizadores. Funciona de forma similar a las líneas directas estatales de denuncia del ICE en Oregón, Connecticut y Nueva Jersey, así como a las líneas directas locales en ciudades como Los Ángeles y Detroit.
La red ha visto un aumento rápido tanto en las llamadas a la línea directa como en el interés de los voluntarios desde que el presidente Donald Trump asumió su segundo mandato, debido a un aumento en la aplicación de medidas migratorias. Colorado es un foco particular de la iniciativa de Trump para las deportaciones masivas, y él ha criticado a Aurora en medio de acusaciones falsas de actividad de pandillas.
Desde enero y mediados de junio, los arrestos de ICE en Colorado casi se han cuadruplicado en comparación con el mismo período del año pasado, según datos del ICE obtenidos por investigadores de UC Berkeley. Los investigadores encontraron que 1.360 personas han sido arrestadas por el ICE en Colorado durante la segunda administración de Trump, y muchas no tienen antecedentes penales. Los datos del ICE de Colorado muestran que más de 400 personas arrestadas fueron marcadas como “otras personas de inmigración violador”, en contraposición a “criminal convicto” o “criminal pendiente cargos”.
Uno de esos arrestos fue el de Jeanette Vizguerra, destacada defensora de los derechos de los inmigrantes, que ha vivido en los EE. UU. desde 1997 y actualmente se encuentra detenida por ICE. Sus abogados han alegado ante un tribunal federal que su arresto fue en represalia por su libertad de expresión.
La administración ha recibido un gran aumento de financiación para la represión migratoria a través de la reducción de impuestos republicana y el proyecto de ley de recortes de gastos que Trump firmó a principios de este mes. El proyecto de ley asigna 170 mil millones de dólares a la seguridad fronteriza, la aplicación de la ley migratoria y la contratación de miles de agentes adicionales del ICE, entre otras prioridades de Trump.
La red está en conflicto con el ICE
La red de respuesta rápida llama a sus voluntarios que se acercan y documentan áreas con presencia reportada de ICE “confirmadores”. Los voluntarios participan en una sesión de formación y la red dice que solo los ciudadanos deben hacerlo por el riesgo de encontrarse con ICE.
Andrea Loya se desempeña como directora de la organización no gubernamental de apoyo a inmigrantes Casa De Paz se beneficia, pero fuera del trabajo, también colabora como confirmadora. En sus seis meses de voluntariado, ha salido más de diez veces, y comentó que cada situación es única.
Cada vez que recibe una llamada de un operador, lleva un megáfono, las tarjetas de información y su teléfono. Durante su salida, se mantiene en comunicación frecuente con otros voluntarios de la red para asegurarse de que sepan que está bien y para que puedan publicar actualizaciones en las redes sociales sobre si el ICE está presente en el lugar reportado. Loya dijo que nunca ha hablado con agentes del ICE y que mantiene la distancia cuando está cerca de ellos.
Loya caracterizó la red como un grupo de vigilancia vecinal: documentar actividades no deseadas e informar a los residentes.
“Es importante para nosotros contrarrestar la narrativa de que lo que estamos haciendo es ilegal”, dijo Loya. “Es simplemente una vigilancia vecinal, algo que la gente lleva años haciendo. Cuando entras en barrios muy bonitos y aparcas allí, la gente se acerca y te pregunta qué haces. Eso es lo que hacemos, pero en nuestras comunidades”.

El Departamento de Seguridad Nacional y la oficina local del ICE en Denver han condenado a la red por presuntamente interferir con las operaciones de control migratorio. Representantes de la oficina local de Denver declinaron ser entrevistados para este artículo.
“Grupos como este interfieren con la capacidad de ICE de mantener seguras a las comunidades”, dijo la oficina de campo de Denver en un comunicado.
La oficina de campo de Denver dijo que realizó una operación en Longmont el 20 de junio para detener a un violador de niños, añadiendo que la red de respuesta rápida lo interrumpió.
La división de Denver del ICE se negó a especificar cómo interfirió la red de respuesta rápida y no comentó si hubo altercados físicos o verbales entre agentes y voluntarios de la red. El ICE afirmó en redes sociales que la redada tenía como objetivo a un hombre de El Salvador buscado en Italia, pero no ha presentado ninguna orden judicial ni ninguna otra prueba que demuestre que la redada se centrara en ese hombre o que se encontraba en Longmont.
En una declaración del 25 de junio, la subsecretaria del Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, Tricia McLaughlin, dijo que la red y sus miembros “interrumpen las operaciones del ICE dirigidas a inmigrantes ilegales criminales peligrosos”.
Jennifer Piper, una líder de larga trayectoria en la red de respuesta rápida, estaba enviando llamadas el 20 de junio. Dijo que un grupo de informadores voluntarios se dirigió a la ubicación de Longmont y hablaron con los lugareños sobre sus derechos, pero no confrontaron ni interfirieron de otra manera con ICE.
“Este incidente incitó a cientos de personas a intentar trollear nuestra línea directa, lo cual no tuvo éxito”, dijo Piper. “Pero esta administración ha difundido mucha desinformación y propaganda. Solo intentamos brindar la mejor información posible a nuestra comunidad”.
Combatiendo el miedo
Lane-Arellano afirmó que documentar los casos en que ICE no está presente en una comunidad es tan importante como documentar la presencia de agentes de inmigración. Esto se debe a que el miedo se ha extendido por las comunidades inmigrantes de Colorado, y es crucial ayudar a sus vecinos a recuperar un nivel de seguridad, dijo.
Cada camioneta blanca o uniforme de policía puede ser una señal de la posible presencia del ICE a personas que temen ser deportadas, especialmente debido a las tácticas del ICE de usar vehículos sin identificación y arrestar a muchos no criminales, agregó.
“Mostramos a la gente lo que realmente está sucediendo, y creo que eso es realmente valioso para que no haya miedo innecesario”, dijo Lane-Arellano. “ICE intenta silenciar ese tipo de trabajo y quiere criminalizarlo. Creo que la gente debería estar muy preocupada cuando hay una entidad gubernamental que nunca rinde cuentas y que intenta minimizar el escrutinio público”.

Algunos de los voluntarios de la red asistieron a una protesta el 7 de julio pidiendo el cierre del Centro de Procesamiento de ICE de Aurora, operado por la empresa de prisiones privadas GEO Group. Vizguerra ha sido detenido allí durante cuatro meses.
La hija de Vizguerra, Luna Báez, fue a las manifestaciones. Si bien las protestas y las publicaciones en redes sociales visibilizan la difícil situación de los detenidos, Báez afirmó que quienes apoyan a los inmigrantes también deberían centrarse en otras medidas de apoyo, como donar a organizaciones sin fines de lucro, brindar servicios de traducción y colaborar como voluntarios con la red de respuesta rápida.
“Se trata de acción directa” Báez dijo. “Hay que sentirse incómodo para desmantelar estos sistemas de opresión.”
Deb Schaffer, residente de Denver, asistió a la protesta y también colabora como confirmadora voluntaria. Hasta el momento, ha participado en unas ocho llamadas.
“Es una forma de apoyar a la comunidad inmigrante y de ser útil, y una forma de sentirse orgulloso de vivir en Colorado”, dijo Schaffer. “Lo estamos haciendo juntos”.
El voluntariado con la red puede tener consecuencias para la salud mental, debido a la intensidad y el sufrimiento que pueden causar las llamadas, dijo Lane-Arellano. Recuerda una llamada que recibió a las 7 a. m. de un director de preescolar del área de Denver, preocupado por la presencia de ICE en las inmediaciones, quien dijo que los padres tenían demasiado miedo de salir de sus autos con sus hijos.
La red envió a alguien quien verificó que en realidad era una agencia policial local. La confirmación de que fue una falsa alarma ayudó a que el preescolar volviera a la normalidad.
Pero esa llamada, y esos padres y niños aterrorizados, quedaron grabados en la memoria de Lane-Arellano.
“Puede ser doloroso, pero lo hago de todos modos por la amabilidad de la gente común”, dijo Lane-Arellano. “Cuando parece que hay tanto odio y crueldad a nivel federal, nos ayuda saber que esto no es lo que defendemos y que hay tanta gente dispuesta a arriesgarse para apoyar a nuestra comunidad”.

Josh Shapiro signed legislation to classify deepfakes in Pennsylvania as digital forgeries, making non-consensual digital impersonation punishable by law.  
Deepfakes are images or videos generated by artificial intelligence, typically for malicious use or to spread misinformation. Now, anyone engaging in digital impersonation will be subject to a misdemeanor of the first degree, while anyone doing so with fraudulent intent will be subject to a felony of the third degree.
“This law gives law enforcement the tools they need to fight this digital deception, yet does so in a responsible manner, protecting First Amendment rights and preserving valid expressions of parody, satire and other forms of free speech,” bill sponsor Sen. Tracy Pennycuick (R-Montgomery) said, after the governor signed it into law last Tuesday.
The bill passed unanimously in the Senate and with near-unanimous support in the House. Pennycuick has previously pushed through legislation to combat digital impersonation, including a law Shapiro signed last October to ban deepfake pornography. 
Pennycuick’s pornography deepfake ban led Republican state Attorney General Dave Sunday to file the first charges involving artificial intelligence in a sexual abuse case in April. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Sunday commended the new legislation and Pennycuick for “recognizing the danger that artificial intelligence poses to Pennsylvanians. Having this law on the books adds another tool to our chest as we continue to proactively investigate and hold offenders accountable,” he said. 
Deepfakes pose a widespread public threat, according to Pennycuick, because they include false images impossible to distinguish from real content, which are often “used to commit financial scams, injure personal reputations and disrupt the political process,” she wrote in a statement. 
“The potential for widespread harm will only grow as artificial intelligence tools become more sophisticated and more readily accessible,” Pennycuick wrote in a memo introducing the bill in February. 
In a recent, high-profile case, a deep-fake impersonating former-President Joe Biden’s voice called New Hampshire voters to tell them not to vote in the 2024 presidential primary. 
Digital scams, including artificial intelligence ones, often target vulnerable populations, such as teenagers and the elderly, as well as small businesses.
Seeing a steady increase in payment app scams targeting senior citizens, then-U.S. Sen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.) advocated for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to increase its user protections in 2022.
Lawmakers around the country have responded to these challenges by introducing over 38 pieces of legislation in 18 states related to deepfake regulation. That’s according to the Transparency Coalition, a nonprofit advocate for AI regulation. This legislative push follows the 80 laws passed across the country to combat deepfakes in 2024, as well as 15 passed in 2023. 
Although statewide regulations have received bipartisan support from federal lawmakers, they have also received some pushback, including from some Republicans in Congress, who criticize regulations for censorship and diminishing the country’s competitive edge in artificial intelligence. 
Republican U.S. House members originally included a decade-long moratorium on state laws regulating AI in this year’s federal budget before it was eventually removed from the final bill. 
Pennsylvania’s upper chamber is considering another bill on digital forgery regulation, which would ban the use of deepfakes in political campaigns, in an effort to improve election security. 
Deepfake regulation has previously faced pushback in the state legislature on the basis of free speech concerns, including a 2021 bill to ban deepakes from political advertisements.

(Photo courtesy of David Hall)Sandwiched between the Delaware River and closely spaced homes, the Monroe Energy oil refinery in Trainer exemplifies the need for better regulation of a dangerous chemical used around the country to produce high-octane gasoline, environmental groups said.
If highly reactive hydrofluoric acid (HF) was released from the Delaware County refinery, it could form a ground-hugging cloud extending up to 17 miles and affecting as many as 1.9 million people in addition to delicate ecosystems nearby. HF attacks the human body causing burns, organ damage and death, a lawsuit against the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency claims.
The Philadelphia-based Clean Air Council, the Natural Resources Defense Council and California-based Communities for a Better Environment are suing the EPA in federal court, asking a judge to order the agency to reassess its regulations on the chemical.
Filed last Tuesday in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, the suit follows the EPA’s rejection of a petition by the groups asking the agency to eliminate unreasonable risks from the use of HF at oil refineries. An EPA spokesperson said the agency has a longstanding practice of not commenting on pending litigation. 
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
HF is used to increase the octane rating of gasoline during the refining process. The groups argue in their lawsuit that more than 40 oil refineries across the country still use HF despite the availability of safer alternatives. The chemical also presents a hazard as it is transported by truck and rail from the only plant where it is manufactured, in Louisiana.
“Needlessly risking release of this extremely hazardous chemical in our densely-packed region where so many people could be injured or killed is reckless. All the other refineries in Pennsylvania manage to use safer alternatives,” Clean Air Council Executive Director Alex Bomstein said in a statement. 
Monroe Energy, a subsidiary of Delta Airlines, is not a defendant in the lawsuit, which also details the risks to populations surrounding refineries that use HF in the Los Angeles and Chicago areas.
A spokesperson for Monroe said the safe operation of the refinery is of paramount importance and the plant’s alkylation unit, where HF is used, is constantly inspected. The company has invested millions of dollars in safety systems for the unit, spokesperson Matt McGlaughlin said.
“Monroe Energy has a robust safety culture and a strong safety record that reflects this, having received numerous accolades for our safety performance over the years,” McLaughlin said, noting they include awards from the state and industry groups.
Delaware County spokesperson Ryan Herlinger said the county’s Hazardous Materials Response Team is prepared to respond to a release of HF from the Monroe Energy refinery.
“Delaware County takes the risks associated with HF seriously and maintains the resources, training, and protocols necessary to respond effectively and support our communities,” Herlinger said.
Composed of a single hydrogen and a single fluorine atom, both highly reactive elements by themselves, HF can cause respiratory problems and skin burns in lower concentrations. At higher levels, the chemical can cause gruesome and often fatal injuries by dissolving skin, muscle and bone.
“Poison acid clouds engulfing refinery communities and transit corridors sounds like a horror movie, but it’s a real possibility as long as EPA refuses to engage,” Matthew Tejada, senior vice president of environmental health at NRDC, said.
The lawsuit lists numerous releases of HF that caused injuries, including a 1987 incident in which a cloud of acid blanketed a Texas neighborhood. But south Philadelphia was the site of a near miss that could have had catastrophic consequences.

In the wee hours of June 21, 2019, a fire and massive explosion rocked the Philadelphia Energy Solutions oil refinery, hurling massive pieces of equipment hundreds of yards, with some landing on the other side of the Schuylkill River. More than 5,000 pounds of HF were released along with propane and other refining byproducts.
The U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board found the cause of the blast was a 50-year-old section of pipe that ruptured and released liquid propane into the alkylation unit where HF was being used. The Trump administration’s budget for next year eliminates funding for the board, effectively shutting it down.
“A heroic worker was able to divert most of the refinery’s HF inventory — 339,000 pounds — to underground tanks, helping prevent an even greater catastrophe,” the lawsuit says, noting the incident injured five refinery workers and one firefighter, but damaged the plant so badly it never reopened.
Annie Fox, a Clean Air Council employee who works with residents in Trainer, Marcus Hook and other communities around the Monroe Energy plant, said the plant has health impacts on people  who live “literally across the street.”
On Thursday, people in Delaware County reported a strong odor of sulfur or gasoline after a power failure forced an emergency shut down of parts of the plant. A towering flame and column of black smoke were emitted from the refinery’s flare stack, videos on social media showed. 
“That is one of the reasons why Trainer is representative of the refineries across the country that still use HF,” Fox said.
She added that the recent closure of Crozer-Chester Medical Center means that the nearest emergency room is at least 20 minutes away and people say they have little guidance on what to do in a serious emergency.

“They’re not putting out emergency response plans. They’re not educating the medical personnel,” Fox said. “One resident who has lived there her entire life said they used to do very serious drills if there was an explosion there.”
According to the NRDC, the Trainer refinery has had five releases of HF since 1990, although only one happened since Monroe Energy took ownership of the plant in 2012 and none affected members of the public. In 2019, eight employees were exposed to HF during maintenance; five required hospitalization.
McGlaughlin, the Monroe Energy spokesperson, said the company has worked closely for years with the Delaware County Local Emergency Planning Committee and hospitals to provide information about what to do in the event of an HF release.
The county haz-mat team is certified by the state to handle highly hazardous chemical releases and equipped with specialized tools to detect such materials, including HF. Members of the team receive specialized training in HF response and carry a supply of the front-line treatment for exposure, Herlinger, the county spokesperson, said.
Monroe Energy also conducts joint training with local fire companies, including hazardous materials response. 
“We work closely with local first responders in the Delaware Valley, a number of whom are also team members here at the refinery, who in turn share their learnings and knowledge with responders in their communities as well,” McGlaughlin said.",https://penncapital-star.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/IMG_1203-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 06:07:19.598159

This drastic cut comes at a moment when, despite significant progress, the coalfields and rural counties of Appalachia remain mired in persistent economic distress.  
The urgency of this threat is real: The future of ARC, and the future of Appalachia itself, hang in the balance.  
For the first time since the coal and timber barons, the railroads, and low-wage furniture and textile factories invaded the region in the late 19th century, Appalachia is in a position to control its future. That future will require more visionary thinking than ARC has demonstrated since its birth in 1965, but the agency is needed to implement new ways of development.
  John Whisman, right a Jaycee from Hazard, conceived of and sold the idea of a regional economic development commission. He is pictured here in 1964 with University of Kentucky Vice President A. D. Albright, left, and James Roosevelt, the son of the president. (University of Kentucky Libraries, Special Collections Research Center)
The 1964 President’s ARC Report, commissioned by President John F. Kennedy and chaired by James Roosevelt, famously called Appalachia “an island of poverty in a sea of affluence.” That phrase, rooted in the stark realities of Central Appalachia’s coalfields, still resonates today. While the region has moved closer to parity with the rest of the nation, the coalfields remain an unfulfilled promise. 
If ARC has a father, it was John Whisman of Hazard, Kentucky, who convinced 13 governors to back a joint state/federal agency to build highways, create development districts, and prioritize regional planning.  That was a remarkable achievement for a very energetic Jaycee who early in his career sold inflatable buildings before in the early 1960s becoming a state employee under Govs. Combs and Breathitt promoting the ARC concept.  He became the states co-chairman of ARC at its inception.
Whisman once told me the genius of the Appalachian Regional Commission was that it “bribed” governors to focus on their most neglected citizens.
Kentucky Gov. Bert Combs was the first governor to buy into Whisman’s vision and helped persuade the rest of the region’s political establishment to get aboard. 
The agency’s politics and geographical outlines have always been complex. New York joined because of Sen. Robert Kennedy; Mississippi because of Rep. Jamie Whitten. Johnny Waters of Sevierville, Tennessee, who helped ignite Sen. Howard Baker’s political career as his campaign chair for student body president at the University of Tennessee, served as federal co-chair during my tenure at ARC.  
Still, the nation resisted focusing federal resources on just one region, no matter the sacrifice that region has made for the whole nation. In Congress, a representative from Iowa would rise during appropriations debates to call ARC “the longest gravy train in American history.”  
  President John F. Kennedy meets with eight governors of Appalachian states on May 8, 1961. At Kennedy’s side, fourth from left, is Kentucky Gov. Bert T. Combs. (John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum)
Politics thus overruled geographers in defining Appalachia.  What was once referred to as the “Southern Highlands” by the Council of the Southern Mountains and most researchers, Appalachia suddenly had Pittsburgh and Birmingham in its fold and extended down to Elvis Presley’s hometown in northern Mississippi. Central Appalachia, mainly the 60 coalfield counties in Southern West Virginia, Eastern Kentucky, Southwest Virginia and East Tennessee, according to ARC’s definition, had to share federal dollars with 423 counties in ARC’s official territory.  Spreading ARC’s appropriation across a population that now stands at 26.3 million left little more than a few dabs to pass around.   
(Federal level attention to the region has a long history. President Abraham Lincoln charged General O.O. Howard, the head of the Freedmen’s Bureau, to “do something” for the mountaineers who had defied the Confederacy and supported the Union.  Howard’s efforts resulted only in Lincoln Memorial University at Harrogate, Tennessee, and the clapboard fire hazard called Howard Hall, a men’s dormitory at Berea College where I alternatively froze and sweated during my sophomore year.)  
Appalachian Regional Commission’s impact has been uneven
When I joined ARC in 1969, I was one of only three regional natives at an agency dominated by outsiders transferred from the Department of Commerce.  I recall at one point more money per capita had gone into the mountains of Maryland than to any other region, further diluting funds for Central Appalachia, the area that justified the agency’s mission. ARC’s reach across 13 states diluted its original coalfield focus and left the region’s deepest needs only partially addressed.   
Despite $6 billion invested in more than 34,000 non-highway projects since 1965, ARC’s impact has been uneven. The agency’s greatest achievements — relocating rivers, building highways and improving infrastructure — are visible, but so are its failures. It never tackled the low taxation of coal properties, absentee land ownership, or the health and safety crises wrought by extractive industries.

ARC never challenged the Tennessee Valley Authority’s introduction and strong financial and political support of strip mining in Eastern Kentucky. It has said nothing about one of the most destructive environmental impacts anywhere in the nation — mountaintop removal mining, which has cut the tops off more than 500 mountains and filled up valleys and waterways with rock and debris that accelerate flooding. 
In short, the Appalachian Regional Commission has never proffered a vision for change that is appropriate and useful in this century of technologically driven development. Federal black lung benefits alone have funneled nearly $50 billion into the region, dwarfing ARC’s total investment and highlighting the scale of unmet need. 
In fairness, ARC’s legacy includes some remarkable, if complicated, physical transformations. The Pikeville Cut-Through Project, completed in 1987, stands as one of the largest civil engineering undertakings in the Western Hemisphere. Nearly 18 million cubic yards of earth and rock were moved — making it second only to the Panama Canal among earth-moving projects in this hemisphere. The project rerouted the Levisa Fork River, eliminated perennial flooding, opened up hundreds of acres for development, and transformed Pikeville into a regional hub. Yet, Pikeville flooded again in the historic Eastern Kentucky flood of July 2022 and again in February.

Counties identified as economically distressed are concentrated in Kentucky, West Virginia and southwestern Virginia. (Appalachian Regional Commission)
In Grundy, Virginia, ARC funds helped relocate the entire business district to higher ground after repeated flooding. The redevelopment included the construction of a unique three-story Walmart atop a public parking garage, a symbol of both economic renewal and the challenges of reinventing a coal town’s identity.  Still, the $6 billion, combined with Appalachian Development Highway spending in the neighborhood of $30 billion or so, is only pocket change for Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos and Warren Buffett. 
  Gayle Manchin (Appalachian Regional Commission)
A half-century on, Appalachia has indeed moved closer to parity. Retrospective ARC studies confirm that conditions in Appalachia have improved greatly, and the region is catching up with the rest of the nation. Gayle Manchin, ARC’s federal co-chair and wife of retired Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, echoes that cautiously upbeat note: While noting important gains, she stresses there is still work to be done to reach true parity. 
Recent data show that unemployment in Appalachia dropped by 0.8 percentage points over the past decade — twice the national rate of improvement. Homeownership is now about 6.7 percentage points higher than the U.S. average. Median family income growth is robust in many urban counties, and in 96 ARC counties, median income matches or exceeds the national median. Poverty has fallen across most Appalachian states, but coalfield poverty rates are consistently nearly double the national rate of 12.4%. In many counties in Eastern Kentucky, poverty is double Appalachia’s 10-year overall average of 14.3%, according to ARC.
Land reform could unlock local potential
 President Lyndon Johnson, signing the ARC legislation in March 1965, promised it would launch Appalachia on “the bright highway of hope.”   
Yet, many Appalachian counties still fall in the nation’s poorest 10%. The region’s median household income is only about 82% of the U.S. median.  Appalachia’s population is older and growing more slowly. In Appalachia, 27.3% of adults (age 25-plus) have earned at least a bachelor’s degree, compared to the U.S. national average of 35%. 
So, while the region as a whole has made undeniable progress, areas like Central Appalachia still trail far behind the nation economically and socially. The latest ARC report on county economic status, for fiscal year 2026, identifies 75 counties in Appalachia as “distressed.” Distressed counties are considered the most economically depressed, ranking in the worst 10% of the nation’s counties. Kentucky has more “distressed” counties than any other state.  In many Eastern Kentucky counties, federal transfer payments — Social Security, black lung and other benefits — make up well over half of taxpayer income, according to the IRS. 
  Ron Eller (Carnegie Center)
Ron Eller, retired professor of Appalachian Studies at the University of Kentucky and a Whisman Scholar at ARC, has long argued that true regional renewal requires more than infrastructure and outside investment. As Eller puts it: “Struggling regions of the country need land reform, including the reduction of absentee land ownership and the promotion of alternative land use.”  
Eller’s research highlights how generations of absentee corporate and elite ownership have drained Appalachia of its wealth and stifled local development. He emphasizes that growth without real development — without addressing who owns and benefits from the land — will never be enough to reverse the region’s fortunes.   
Coal and timber companies own 30% to 70% of the land in counties in the coalfields, frequently the best lands for development. The largest single landowner in the region is the federal government. 
These facts of land ownership and scandalously low taxation were documented in a 1980 study championed by ARC Federal Co-Chair Al Smith, but the study was shelved and has never been updated. 
Remaking the Appalachian Regional Commission for the 21st century
To truly transform the region, the Appalachian Regional Commission must move beyond the legacy of highways and infrastructure and embrace a tech-forward, community-driven vision that addresses the root causes of generational poverty and outmigration.  
To begin, implementing a transparent, digital land ownership system would finally expose the web of absentee ownership and hidden tax loopholes that have plagued the region for generations. Local governments could plan smarter, enforce fair taxation, and ensure that the wealth of Appalachia benefits its people.  
  Gov. Andy Beshear, right, visited Letcher County in April to announce grants for road and sewer construction to serve the proposed Grand View subdivision on a reclaimed strip mine site in Jenkins — part of Beshear’s plan to replace housing lost to flooding on “higher ground.” (Gov. Andy Beshear Instagram)
Next, a modern homesteading act could acquire land from bankrupt and/or ailing coal and timber companies and offer it to returning families and entrepreneurs, reversing outmigration and seeding new communities above the floodplain. Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear is leading the charge to locate communities on higher ground above the flood plain. Coal and timber companies have been scarce in offering their lands for this effort. ARC could have, and still can, take up Eller’s challenge to initiate land reform in the coalfields. 
Using modern analytics, ARC could help counties enforce honest property taxes on coal, timber, and mineral holdings. Even modest improvements could generate millions annually for local schools, clinics and infrastructure — resources long denied by absentee corporations. Support for innovative community land trusts would keep wealth local, allowing former mine sites to be redeveloped for agriculture, housing or recreation.  
This grassroots land reform would prevent future extraction of both resources and profits and focus on renewable power, innovative agriculture and timber management, repurposing millions of acres of damaged land, and a host of other development practices that are being tried in other regions and nations. In fact, all over the mountains efforts like these are being undertaken by community groups, but those efforts need large infusions of federal support if they are to uplift the region to national economic and social levels.  Sadly, the Trump administration is proposing to stripmine away the few budgetary dollars currently allocated to these efforts. The cuts just imposed on Medicaid, food aid through SNAP and other programs will darken the bright spots of regional progress. 
Doubling down on education, health care and job training — delivered via technology — would help coalfield counties overcome geographic barriers. Expanding community colleges and vocational programs can equip the next generation to build a diversified economy. Strengthening community development organizations ensures that Appalachian residents — not outside investors — shape their own future. Democratic planning tools can give real voice to those most affected by policy decisions. 
These suggested reforms are not “feel-good” measures. They are systemic, targeted responses to the structural causes of poverty and underdevelopment. As one local leader put it, “there’s not one silver bullet to replace coal … there are a lot of silver BBs.” Each incremental step toward local control and accountability helps reverse a century of extractive policy and absentee governance.

Calling JD Vance
Restoring hope and trust to a region long disappointed by promises of sustained aid that never came is critical bedrock for change.  I’ll be the first to admit that thinking these things can happen in the current Gilded Age environment is a truly Herculean leap of faith.

That brings me to Vice President JD Vance. With roots in Breathitt County, Kentucky, and a professed concern for Appalachia, Vance is in a position to fight for the region. But so far, his only major initiative tied to the region has been AppHarvest — a flashy but failed indoor farming venture based in Morehead. Vance invested in the business and sat on the board with Martha Stewart. 
If Vance and his Silicon Valley allies want to prove their new approaches to development and governance, supporting ARC and pushing for genuine reforms would be a good place to start. Appalachia can be the proving ground for whether government can work differently, and better. If Vance and the tech innovators who talk about reimagining government are serious, Appalachia offers a perfect laboratory for bold, non-welfare reforms that could set a new model for federal engagement. 
The region that was once “an island of poverty in a sea of affluence” stands at a crossroads. The bridge that ARC represents is more necessary than ever — not as a relic of the past, but as the foundation for a bold, tech-forward, and community-driven future.

(Mint Images/Getty Images)A Washington D.C.-based nonprofit spent over $400,000 on ads in the final weeks of the 2025 Rhode Island legislative session to persuade state lawmakers to vote against legislation aimed at protecting a federal drug pricing mandate from manufacturer interference. 
But it wasn’t enough.
The General Assembly ultimately passed the tripartisan legislation to prevent drugmakers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) from controlling patient access to discounted medications under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. The program, which began in 1992, requires manufacturers to offer steep discounts to participating providers, often small community health centers and safety net hospitals.
Gov. Dan McKee signed the companion bills by Rep. Jon D. Brien, a Woonsocket independent, and Sen. Bridget Valverde, a North Kingstown Democrat, into law on June 27. The legislation had overwhelming support in the House, including from nine of the chamber’s 10 Republicans. Both bills saw unanimous approval by the Senate.
Rhode Island House lights up to protect federal drug discount program from Big Pharma

Rhode Island now joins a growing list of states that have passed laws to defend contract pharmacy use or prohibit PBM discrimination against 340B entities. The laws have come in response to restrictions imposed by manufacturers on 340B participants limiting where prescriptions can be dispensed, especially those filled at contract pharmacies, like a patient’s local CVS or Walgreens, that fill prescriptions on a provider’s behalf. 
The law allowing Rhode Island’s new protections takes effect Oct. 1, 2025.
Rhode Island’s 340B program received a boost from the state’s fiscal 2026 budget, which called on the Executive Office of Health and Human Services to align itself with some of the same actions in Brien and Valverde’s bills, such as preventing manufacturer discrimination against contract pharmacies. The budget clause also asks for annual reports from 340B providers and oversight from the Auditor General.  
The new law is a blow to the Big Pharma lobbyists who have been critical of 340B, arguing that hospitals and pharmacies exploit the federal program for profit. Such was the message in the 789 TV and radio spots urging Rhode Island lawmakers to “stop 340B abuse today” purchased by Community Action for Responsible Hospitals during the final weeks of the legislative session.
“Rhode Island families go broke, CEOs get rich,” stated a TV ad that aired on WJAR Channel 10 during the weeks surrounding the end of the legislative session, which wrapped up June 21.
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals’ website describes its membership as “patient-focused stakeholders” including labor unions, faith leaders, health care providers, consumer advocates, and public interest groups.
The Washington-D.C. group spent $178,881 to air ads on Channel 10 and cable, along with radio stations WPRO and WEAN, between mid May and late June, according to filings made with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
“I saw a couple of the ads on TV, and it struck me,” Matthew Ulricksen, an associate professor of political science for the Community College of Rhode Island, said in an interview. “I don’t really remember seeing much of an advertising campaign by interest groups around a state budget debate before.”
Ulricksen said the little information available suggests the group could be Big Pharma companies masquerading as a pro-labor, pro-consumer.
“If Bristol-Myers Squibb Company runs an ad on TV in Rhode Island, that’s going to raise peoples’ eyebrows,” he said. “[Instead], they look like a public interest group that is doing this for a noble purpose rather than corporations that are lobbying to protect their bottom lines.” 
The ads also caught Brien’s eyes and ears. The lawmaker said he believes the money to pay for them came from pharmaceutical companies.
“I felt that every time they ran that ad that it helped our cause,” Brien said in an interview. “I was able to say the only opposition we have is Big Pharma — this is them and they’re lying to you, as usual.”
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals lists transparency in hospital ownership and pricing among its primary policy priorities. But as a not-for-profit 501(c)(4), the group is not required to reveal its donors. However, it must file a statement of revenues and expenses annually with the IRS, though the organization is not listed on the federal government’s nonprofit database.
The group’s social media presence consists of accounts on X, Instagram, LinkedIn and YouTube — all with relatively few followers and posts since going online in the spring. The YouTube channel has one subscriber and no content at all.
“That’s exactly what they do — it’s slapdash,” Ulricksen said of pop-up lobbying groups.

Pro-labor or not?
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals’ website claims that 340B “hurts labor.” But the labor union representing Rhode Island’s health care workers backed the state’s 340B legislation. SEIU 1199NE wrote to the House Committee on Health and Human Services in April that the bill was a way the state could “help prevent the collapse of our community health infrastructure.”
The group is not on the radar of the state’s most powerful union leader.
“That does not sound familiar to me,” Rhode Island AFL-CIO President Patrick Crowley said when asked if he had heard of Community Action for Responsible Hospitals.
The Rhode Island Secretary of State’s lobby tracker database lists at least 13 pharmaceutical companies registered to lobby the General Assembly in 2025. Four —  Eli Lilly, Bristol Myers-Squibb Company, Amgen Inc., and Sanofi — indicated their opposition to the 340B legislation, H5634 and S114. Johnson & Johnson, Alexion, GlaxoSmithKline, Purdue Pharma, Otsuka, Novartis, the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company, and Vertex did not list any stance on the legislation.
Merck & Co. was listed as “watching” the companion bills, according to its filings with the state.
The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), one of several trade groups registered to lobby at the State House, testified in opposition before the House Committee on Health Human Services on April 10.
Rhode Island Current reached out to PhRMA to inquire about its familiarity with Community Action for Responsible Hospitals. 
“I have not heard of them,” Stami Turk, director of state public affairs for PhrMA, said in a phone interview.

So, who’s behind the group?
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals officially registered as a lobbyist with the Rhode Island Secretary of State’s Office on May 27 — less than a month before the end of the 2025 legislative session. Faith Cybowski, spokesperson for the office, said it’s very common for entities to pop up late into the legislative year.
“The requirement is just that the lobbyist registers within seven days of conducting the lobbying activity and then files reports as required,” Chybowski said via text message.
Two reports detailing the group’s lobbying activity were submitted to the state. The reports list no contributions related to opposing the 340B legislation. But two disbursements totaling $404,845 are listed for advertising by Fifty-Six Media LLC — a New York City firm that boasts itself as “leading brands into the next generation of the internet.”
The reports list one lobbyist: Michael Kapsa, with a phone number and email address. The voicemail greeting indicates the user has a Google Voice number to handle calls. Rhode Island Current left three messages, none of which were returned.
But Kapsa responded to an email with a brief statement critical of Valverde’s legislation:
“Senate Bill 114 lacks transparency and oversight and would accelerate the misuse of the 340B program that drives up costs for Rhode Island patients, union members, and underserved communities,” Kapsa wrote. “It gives a blank check to bad actors who abuse 340B to pad profits instead of helping patients.”
Kapsa is the chief financial officer for SolidaritUS Health, a Washington D.C.-based health care group that partners with local insurance exchanges that share claims databases to develop primary care programs for employer and labor union employees. 
SolidaritUS was founded in 2017 as an offshoot of “America’s Agenda,” an alliance of labor, business, health care providers and policymakers with Kapsa serving as its chief economist. The company’s chairman is Dick Gephardt, the former Democratic Missouri congressman turned lobbyist whose firm has represented the multinational pharmaceutical company Bayer.
In 2021, Kapsa was tapped by the Biden administration to join a federal advisory committee meant to help the U.S. Department of Labor develop a standard format for group health plans to all payer claims databases.
FCC filings list Kapsa’s name as the primary ad buyer in Rhode Island. They also name Dr. Steven Sleigh as the president of Community Action for Responsible Hospitals. Sleigh is a D.C.-area consultant who previously worked for the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, according to his LinkedIn profile. 
The names of both Sleigh and Kapsa appear on a 990 tax form submitted by the Pbm Accountability Project, a pop-up lobby that aired ads in Washington D.C. in 2023 as Congress considered various bills meant to ensure PBMs keep drug prices low.
Rhode Island Current reached out to Sleigh on June 30 and followed up on July 3.
“Really don’t have any comment on the Rhode Island situation,” Sleigh said in an email response on July 3.
Community Action for Responsible Hospitals also led lobbying efforts against legislation to protect the 340B program in Oregon and Illinois. Their lobbying was unsuccessful in Oregon while the bill in Illinois is still under consideration.
Brien likened the group’s expensive efforts in Rhode Island to “the last gasp of a dying man.”
“They could have thrown a million dollars at this thing and you weren’t going to move the legislators in the House and the Senate on this one,” he said. “You could have run them every 10 minutes and it wouldn’t have mattered.”

(Kentucky Lantern photo by McKenna Horsley)The University of Louisville has disbanded the UofL Women’s Network and four other employee groups in response to a new state law.
A former president of one of the disbanded groups criticized the action, telling the Kentucky Lantern it goes further than required by the Republican legislature’s new ban on diversity initiatives in public higher education.
Ricky Jones, former president of the UofL Black Faculty/Staff Association and professor of Pan-African Studies, said the employee resource groups provided safe spaces for underrepresented people and allowed them to have “a unified voice to speak to the administration about issues.” 
Jones criticized administrators at UofL and other universities for bowing to political pressure on decisions about diversity, equity and inclusion on campus. He predicted the assault on diversity in Kentucky higher education will “get worse before it gets better.”
“Higher education in Kentucky, for Black folk in particular, and for other groups that are being targeted, I think it’s a lost cause at this point, unless something drastic changes. And we don’t have leadership at these schools that are committed to making those types of changes, so we’re in trouble.”
In addition to the groups for Black and women faculty and staff, UofL has eliminated the Asian, Asian American and Pacific Islander Faculty and Staff Association; Hispanic Latino Faculty and Staff Association; and the LGBTQ+ Faculty and Staff Association.
After a review, some university resource groups “were deemed not to be” in compliance with the new law, said UofL spokesperson John Karman. 
“Our Employee Success Center will continue to explore ways to support meaningful engagement and to ensure all UofL faculty and staff are valued and supported,” Karman added. 
Employee resource groups, or ERGs, were created to “promote a climate of inclusion and provide a place where employees can come together to network, create a strong sense of community, and share their concerns,” according to a now-removed UofL web page description.
Earlier this year, Kentucky’s Republican-controlled General Assembly passed House Bill 4, which eliminates diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs and resources at all public universities and colleges within the commonwealth. The universities were directed to enact changes to meet the law’s requirements by June 30, 2025. 
UofL and Kentucky’s other public universities began reviewing policies in the spring shortly after the law was passed. Eastern Kentucky University adopted a viewpoint neutrality policy and a resolution saying EKU plans to comply with the law in May. Before the 2025 legislative session, the University of Kentucky and Northern Kentucky University disbanded their diversity offices amid scrutiny of DEI programs nationally. 
UofL President Gerry Bradley outlined how university administration reviewed programs and resources for compliance with the law in a June 27 email to campus. That included work groups reviewing areas of “position analysis; policy analysis; admissions, financial aid and scholarships; and athletics.” The work group submitted recommendations to UofL’s legal counsel and a Board of Trustees committee. The board considered policy changes during a June 26 meeting. 
Bradley wrote in his email that decisions to implement changes “were difficult to make in the face of our work to build a culture of belonging — a culture that supports all, that is welcoming of all and reflects our community of care.” He acknowledged that people “have felt hurt and abandoned during this process,” adding that he has “heard your voices and understand the feelings expressed.”
“Let me assure you that I stand by my commitment to support and celebrate all of our community and meet their needs,” Bradley said. “This matter will continue to spark important and necessary conversations about ideas of belonging, success, access to higher education and more. 
“With this challenge comes an opportunity for all of us to remain committed to making the University of Louisville a place where we embrace differences and celebrate uniqueness. We will continue to do so with compassionate and steadfast resolve.”
Jones, the UofL professor, said the university’s actions speak louder than the president’s words. He said the state’s new anti-DEI law makes no mention of the kinds of employee groups that UofL ordered dismantled and said administrators chose to be “more aggressive about anti-diversity moves” than the bill required. “Either they agree with the uber-conservative legislators coming out of Frankfort who are doing real and meaningful harm to Black people, LGBTQ people and others” or “they just don’t care,” Jones said. 
“I think it’s just a feeling of hopelessness there right now,” he said. “It’s to the point now even those of us who have spoken out over the years, it’s like, ‘Speak out for what?’ This is over.”",https://kentuckylantern.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IMG_3826-1024x768.jpg,,,2025-07-14 06:07:19.598159

Across most of the South and Midwest, state laws bar local governments from requiring employers to provide paid sick leave, effectively stripping cities of the power to enact their own labor protections.

What happened when 2 KY cities tried to raise wage
The Kentucky legislature in 2017 enacted a law that preempts local governments from requiring employers to provide fringe benefits such as sick leave. The law also bars local governments from raising the minimum wage.
The action reinforced a Kentucky Supreme Court ruling from the year before that struck down local minimum wage increases in Louisville and Lexington.
The court ruled 6-1 that cities in Kentucky lack the authority to establish a minimum wage different from that set by the state.
The Louisville ordinance had required employers to pay at least $8.25 an hour and Lexington’s $8.20 an hour. 
Kentucky’s statewide minimum wage has been $7.25, the same as the federal minimum, since 2009. 

Nearly 73 million workers live in the 18 states, including Kentucky, that now have such preemptive laws, according to a new report from A Better Balance, a legal advocacy organization focused on workplace rights, and the National Partnership for Women & Families, a nonprofit advocacy group.
“Local leaders know what’s best for their communities. To take away the decision-making power from local communities on this issue and others is very, very concerning,” said Feroza Freeland, policy director of the Southern office at A Better Balance, and one of the report’s authors.
Among the 18 states included in the report was Missouri. The legislature passed a measure in May to repeal paid leave requirements voters had approved in November that expanded access to paid sick leave for about 728,000 workers who lacked it. Republican Gov. Mike Kehoe on Thursday signed the statewide repeal into law. Local paid sick leave laws have been banned in Missouri since 2017.
Kehoe in a statement called the paid sick leave mandates “onerous,” saying they dictated when and how sick leave was provided and had “burdensome” recordkeeping and compliance obligations.
Nationwide, about 27 million workers don’t earn paid sick days, the report found. Many of them work low-wage and part-time jobs, and they’re disproportionately likely to be women, younger workers and people of color, according to the report.
“Folks are facing impossible choices between their own health — or the health of their children — and continuing to earn a paycheck to pay bills and put food on the table,” Freeland told Stateline.
In the absence of federal laws guaranteeing paid sick leave for workers, more cities and local governments have passed their own, including Chicago, Minneapolis, Pittsburgh and Seattle.
But lawmakers in 18 states, mainly in the South and Midwest, have done the opposite, the report found. GOP legislators have said such paid leave requirements create financial hardship for employers, particularly for smaller businesses.
Over the past decade, in GOP-led states across the country, Republican lawmakers have tried to limit the policymaking power of Democratic-led urban centers on issues ranging from immigration to voting rights to LGBTQ+ matters.
While all of the states that preempt local paid sick leave laws are Republican-led, many conservative-led states in the Mountain West don’t have such laws.
Katherine Gallagher Robbins, a senior fellow at the National Partnership and another author of the report, said that’s because Western states tend to have more of a libertarian bent. And she said preemption laws in the South have their roots in historically racist standards that undervalue Black workers.
More than half the Black labor force — 56% — lives in one of the 18 states that prohibit local paid sick time protections, the report said.
Freeland also pointed out that the paid sick leave issue impacts not just urban centers, but rural communities as well. Many people without paid sick leave work in physically demanding jobs such as manufacturing and farming.
The report’s authors say that paid sick leave laws can help reduce the spread of illness, increase employment and wages, particularly for women with child care responsibilities, and can help recruit and retain workers.

That includes championing policies that attract key industries and jobs to help move the state’s economy forward.
However, this goal is currently in jeopardy. Wall Street hedge funds and foreign interests have recently found another way to expand their influence and profit lines by financing lawsuits lawyers would typically decline. These third-party funders are then repaid by receiving a substantial amount of a lawsuit’s settlement funds. 
This blatant tactic to exploit our nation’s legal system for financial gain comes at the economic expense of everyday businesses, including those in Colorado. Specifically, according to Bloomberg, Russian president Vladimir Putin and his allies are using our country to invest in third-party litigation that has allowed them to make millions. To protect our economy and businesses, leaders in Washington should consider the Protecting Our Courts from Foreign Manipulation Act to stop this foreign involvement.

These agreements have enabled third-party funders to exploit cracks in our legal process to weaken the integrity of our judicial system. A reporting segment from 60 Minutes last year notes that third-party funders create a conflict of interest between a lawyer and the plaintiff. Although attorneys maintain that they are working in their client’s best interests, the funds required to bring a lawsuit are being financially paid for by the outside, third-party funder who demands a return on their investment. This fact grants them major leverage over the direction of a case, as these financiers can prioritize their own objectives over that of the actual client.
Third-party funders have used this influence to improve their bottom line at the expense of our economy. As Swiss Re Institute found, these financiers have prolonged cases for nearly a year and a half for their own financial benefit, even if the parties involved want to negotiate a reasonable settlement on a short timeline. Burford Capital, an investment firm involved in third-party litigation, attempted to influence a case to a whole other level by suing their client, Sysco Foods, for accepting a settlement Burford thought wasn’t good enough for their bottom line.
Colorado has especially felt the economic impact of third-party litigation. This industry has  effectively bolstered mass‑tort litigation in the state, now amounting to an estimated $8.5 billion annually — significantly increasing legal risk and costs for Colorado businesses.
Furthermore, by dragging out cases, these third-party funders are also increasing defense and liability expenses for businesses by 20%, according to the Swiss Re Institute. This takes away resources that would otherwise be used by businesses to expand their products and services, employ additional workers, and contribute to and invest in their local economy and communities. Instead, these costs are being passed on to our communities resulting in higher prices on everyday items. 
In health care/medical liability, we see complex cases where it may be years before a patient realizes they had an adverse medical outcome. From there, the legal process can take several more years to determine if the outcome was an unanticipated result or truly due to medical negligence. While we do not yet know the extent of third-party funding in medical liability because current laws do not dictate any transparency requirements, we have begun to see how it can influence judicial proceedings.
As reported in a Law360 article last year, a Minnesota federal judge called a $110 million verdict award in a medical liability case “shockingly excessive.” This case demonstrates how the silent and unreported involvement of litigation financiers can escalate awards to unpredictable amounts, disrupting costs to healthcare providers and inevitably patients.
While longer lifecycle cases can sometimes lead to higher settlements, third-party funders often receive the majority share of the money awarded, taking advantage of people at an incredibly vulnerable time. An example of a health care-related case, reported in a 2019 New York Times article, highlighted how even though women who suffered injuries from pelvic mesh implant manufactured products won billions of dollars in damages, a hefty amount of the awarded funds went to third-party funders and their attorneys. This meant that thousands of victims were left with little money to help treat their medical issues, all while the third-party litigation funding industry stuffed their pockets.
Now, even our foreign adversaries are taking advantage of the lack of regulation in the third-party litigation funding industry to secretly target our economy and national security. Recent reporting from Bloomberg affirms that Russian billionaires with ties to Putin invested $20 million in bankruptcy cases in New York and London. They are now also threatening to go after our national security infrastructure, including semiconductor companies and defense firms.
We saw this happen in 2019, when the Wall Street Journal reported how foreign actors secretly funded third-party litigation behind the defunct company VLSI Technology to attack Intel Corporation, taking billions away from them.
There is a way for Congress to provide transparency within the third-party litigation funding industry. The Protecting Our Courts from Foreign Manipulation Act is a way for Congress to provide transparency within this industry and would stop foreign involvement while protecting our economy and businesses.

The closest in-state labor and delivery unit to Young’s home is Hot Springs’ CHI St. Vincent hospital. Even routine prenatal medical appointments required Young to take time off work during her first pregnancy, she said, but this time CHI’s AR MOMS system of mobile health clinics has alleviated the problem.

“It has made a big impact for us financially, because it saves us from having to be out of gas money, out of time,” said Young, a Medicaid beneficiary and her household’s only income earner.
The AR MOMS mobile health clinics help fill a growing need in rural Southwest Arkansas, which has few maternal health care providers and only four delivery hospitals: two in Hot Springs, one in Camden and one in Mena. Texarkana’s hospital stopped delivering babies after a new owner bought the facility last year, and the hospital on the Texas side of the state line does not accept Arkansas Medicaid.
AR MOMS has a presence in eight small cities: Nashville, De Queen, Mt. Ida, Glenwood, Magnolia, Amity, Fordyce and Murfreesboro. The program serves pregnant residents of Montgomery, Polk, Pike, Howard, Sevier, Hot Spring, Clark, Dallas, Calhoun, Ouachita and Columbia counties.
“With our mobile clinics, moms can drive 30 minutes or five minutes and receive their prenatal care much earlier, which is the goal: to see all the moms in the first trimester and identify any needs that they have,” such as housing and nutrition benefits, transportation assistance and perinatal mental health care, registered nurse and AR MOMS director Dawne Sokora said.
The program launched in September 2023 and is funded by a $4 million federal rural maternity obstetrics grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.










The question is going to be: Will we be able to do as much for our moms as far as social determinants of health and being able to facilitate transportation and those sorts of things for them?


– Dawne Sokora, registered nurse and AR MOMS director


Like Young, Brittney Santos has relied on Hot Springs for labor and delivery services, but when she had her first child in 2010, she lived in Arkadelphia and gave birth there. Arkadelphia’s hospital no longer has a labor and delivery unit.
Santos now lives in Daisy, a Pike County town of fewer than 100 people, and visited AR MOMS’ Glenwood location during her high-risk pregnancy last year.
“They were sweethearts,” Santos said. “They tried to take care of me the best they could…but there was only so much they could do for me.”

When Santos sought help for early cervical dilation during her pregnancy last year, she sought help from the AR MOMS clinics in Glenwood and De Queen, but neither could help. They directed her to Hot Springs.
Seven months postpartum, Santos said she is still experiencing pain and mobility issues but has not received the care she needs because Hot Springs providers are “so busy they can’t help you after you have the baby.”
For Young, the mobile clinics provide “peace of mind” due to Southwest Arkansas’ shortage of providers and long drives to regular clinics and hospitals. Young hasn’t had problems during her second pregnancy, she said, but providers at Nashville’s AR MOMS clinic have given her medication to reduce her risk of developing preeclampsia, which she had during her first pregnancy.
“They call, they check on you…They’re always offering a helping hand,” Young said. “Other times, I’ve had experiences where it’s not been like that, where they just want you in and out real quick.”
 Provider reimbursements

The future of the clinics is uncertain, however. The program is expected to end in August 2026, but Sokora said she hopes the federal government will extend the program because she plans to have excess funds as a result of being “very frugal.”
Sokora said she previously stretched a $690,000 federal grant for a three-year maternal health program into five years, but she acknowledged that meeting pregnant rural Arkansans’ needs takes a lot more than frugality.
Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has issued a series of executive orders and other guidance pausing, halting or throwing into uncertainty a wide range of federal grants. Sokora said she’s not worried about losing the grant sustaining AR MOMS with one year left, but she worries she won’t be allowed to “roll over excess funds” for the program’s final year.
“The question is going to be: Will we be able to do as much for our moms as far as social determinants of health and being able to facilitate transportation and those sorts of things for them?” Sokora said. “I believe that we will be able to sustain the grant past [2026], but it will be on a much smaller scale.”
A new state law will be “the only reason” AR MOMS is likely to last beyond the grant’s expiration date, Sokora said. The Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act separated the billing rates for labor and delivery and allowed health care providers throughout Arkansas to bill for community health workers, doulas and perinatal mental health specialists.
Bills to improve Arkansas maternal health, change ballot initiative process head to Sanders’ desk

The federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services authorized a 70% increase in Arkansas’ maximum reimbursement rate for obstetrical care “to include prenatal, delivery and postpartum care,” according to a rule authorized by state lawmakers last month in order for the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act to go into effect.
The Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act passed the Legislature with bipartisan support, but some lawmakers took issue with lowering the statute of limitations for legal actions against alleged medical injuries during birth from children’s 11th birthday to their fifth.
Only 33 hospitals in 22 of Arkansas’ 75 counties have labor and delivery units, and six maternity wards have closed since 2020. The medical malpractice insurance required to cover the previous 11-year statute of limitations contributed to the closures and fosters the state’s difficulty recruiting and retaining obstetrician-gynecologists, said Sen. Missy Irvin, R-Mountain View, the primary Senate sponsor of the Healthy Moms, Healthy Babies Act.
Maternal health professionals are “not going to make a living” in rural areas without additional policy changes, Sokora said.
“In these small towns where 80% of your patients are on Medicaid, and the reimbursement is so low, I think the reimbursement going up will help just as much as the malpractice [insurance] going down,” Sokora said.

The legislature that convenes in January will enact a two-year state budget. (Kentucky Lantern photo by Sarah Ladd)FRANKFORT — Kentucky state government revenue grew by only a fraction of 1% in the fiscal year that ended June 30.
The Office of State Budget Director reports that receipts to the state’s General Fund for the year totaled $15.7 billion.
That was $132 million, or 0.8%, more than the fund took in the previous fiscal year.
The tiny growth rate is actually a bit of good news because the state budget anticipated no growth for the year.
Kentucky’s 2024-26 budget passed by lawmakers in early 2024 anticipated no revenue growth last year largely because of income tax rate cuts in recent years. Also, the state was leaving a period of extraordinary growth from 2020-24 due to federal stimulus spending during the Covid pandemic combined with high inflation that flooded the treasuries of virtually all states.
But falling short of budgeted expectations in the last fiscal year were the General Fund’s largest sources of income — the sales tax and the income tax, according to the July 10 report.
The sales tax took in $5.8 billion, which is the same amount it took in during the prior year, and about $250 million short of what had been anticipated in the current budget.
The income tax took in $5.3 billion, which was about $490 million lower than it took in during the 2024 fiscal year and $227 million short of expectations.
The weakness in the sales and income tax revenue was more than offset by an unforeseen increase in revenue from business taxes. “Major business taxes far exceeded the official estimates offsetting lower than forecasted income and sales tax receipts,” State Budget Director John Hicks said in Thursday’s report. “Strength in business taxes demonstrates that Kentucky businesses are producing at a profitable level,” Hicks said.
The $132 million is a “revenue” surplus, but not the final surplus. The final surplus, which will be transferred to the state’s Budget Reserve Trust Fund, is likely to be somewhat smaller after accounting for state spending for the year is completed later this month.
The end of the fiscal year poses the question of whether the state’s fiscal condition is strong enough to allow the General Assembly to again cut the income tax rate. A landmark 2022 law set up conditions that must be met and a process by which the General Assembly can incrementally cut the income tax rate by one-half percentage point per year. That law’s goal  is to eventually eliminate the state income tax.
Under the law, the Republican supermajorities in the Kentucky House and Senate reduced the income tax rate in 2022 from 5% to 4.5%, in 2023 from 4.5% to 4% percent and early this year from 4% to 3.5%. (The rate cut passed this year does not take effect until Jan. 1, 2026.)
The 2022 law allows another half percentage point cut to be considered so long as two specific conditions are met: The balance in the Budget Reserve fund is at least 10% of what total General Fund receipts were in the fiscal year, and that revenue would still have exceeded General Fund spending in the prior fiscal year even if the income tax rate had been 1 full percentage point lower.
(The complicated income tax reduction law has been amended since 2022 in ways that make it easier to meet the conditions for half-point rate cuts, and also to allow lawmakers to consider rate cuts of less than a half percentage point under certain circumstances.)
  Sen. Christian McDaniel, chair of the Senate budget committee, speaks on the Senate floor, March 11, 2025. (LRC Public Information)
The State Budget Office must yet account for spending during last fiscal year and make other calculations before it determines whether the 2022 law would allow for another half percentage point cut during the 2026 General Assembly. The office must report its conclusion to the legislature by Sept. 5.
State Sen. Chris McDaniel, the Ryland Heights Republican who chairs the Senate budget committee, said he is not sure whether the threshold will be met. “We’ll see. … But as I’ve said before, we knew when we passed the rate reduction this year that the next cut would be a taller order.”
Jason Bailey, executive director of the progressive think tank Kentucky Center for Economic Policy, said the revenue numbers for last fiscal year raise significant concerns “that really aren’t surprising.”
Bailey said, “The income tax was down, mostly because of rate cuts, but the sales tax leveled off and fell below its estimate. … Those are the two largest sources of revenue.
“It’s only because of such high revenues from business taxes —which are notoriously volatile sources of revenue — that the gap was closed,” Bailey said.
Growth in state government’s other major fund — the Road Fund — was also flat in the 2025 fiscal year. The July 10 report says the Road Fund brought in $1.86 billion for the year. That was $11 million less than the fund’s revenue in 2024, but nearly $39 million more than was anticipated in the state budget for the year.
 The Road Fund pays for highway construction and maintenance and other transportation programs. It is funded by the gasoline tax, the sales tax on vehicles and various fees. The General Fund pays for other state programs and is funded by most state taxes.

(Photo courtesy of American Nonsmokers' Rights Foundation)I’ve worked in the casino business for 30 years. For the past seven years, I’ve worked in Rhode Island casinos where I’m forced to breathe secondhand smoke every single shift to keep my job — a health risk to which no other workers in this state are subjected. You might think smoking is a relic of the past, but tobacco use and secondhand smoke exposure remain leading causes of preventable death and disease. And thanks to a loophole in Rhode Island’s clean indoor air laws, the two casinos in Lincoln and Tiverton are among the few places where employees are still exposed to deadly toxic air, day-in and day-out.
Lawmakers were ready to close that loophole last month. But not quite.
I love my job, but it’s taken a toll. For years I’ve been on medication to manage the damage from the smoke. When casinos went smokefree indoors during COVID, I finally got a break. But in 2022, when smoking returned, so did the poison. Workers started getting sick all over again. It took nine grueling months to get back on medications and six months of sick leave just to regain enough strength to return. Even after moving to an office job as an iGaming shift manager to avoid the worst of it, my asthma still flares up. I keep a nebulizer on site just to manage it. This isn’t just my story. Hundreds of casino workers — dealers to back office staff — face this daily exposure. 
Like many other states during the pandemic, Rhode Island temporarily prohibited indoor smoking in casinos for two years to protect public health. It proved what we’ve always known: Smokefree gaming is possible and profitable. When protections ended and workers were once again needlessly exposed, casino workers began speaking out and formed Casino Workers Against Smoking Effects (CEASE), which has grown to thousands of members nationwide. Smokefree casinos are already the standard in Massachusetts, New York, and Tribal casinos in Connecticut.
But after years of fighting, three days before the end of the 2025 legislative session, the Rhode Island Senate was finally ready to hear a bill that would end the exemption to the state’s indoor smoking ban enjoyed for years by Rhode Island’s two casinos, effective immediately. Then an eleventh-hour amendment opened a new loophole that still left workers at risk. The legislation that passed both the Senate and the House allowed casinos to continue permitting smoking in “pari mutual smoking lounges” — without requiring them to follow the same rules that apply to every other smoking lounge in the state. 
What does that even mean? It could be the entire gaming floor, or any other gimmick that lets casinos get around the law and keep workers in smoke-filled areas. Only the Lincoln casino has such a smoking lounge right now, but nothing stops the opening of one in Tiverton. 










This isn’t just my story. Hundreds of casino workers — dealers to back office staff — face this daily exposure. 


If workers are still breathing secondhand smoke, then we haven’t closed the loophole yet. The goal of this legislation was to ensure no casino worker inhaled toxic air at work, but this loophole allows casinos to keep doing just that. The vision of the overall bill was right, but this last-minute amendment gutted that. Suddenly workers like me found themselves again forced to work in smoke-filled areas even when the law says they’re supposed to be smokefree. I can tell you exactly how we’ll know when we’ve succeeded: when I can go to work, breathe freely, and not carry a nebulizer just to get through my shift.
Secondhand smoke doesn’t respect boundaries or stay put in one section of a building. The American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) — the professionals who design ventilation systems — says, “There is currently no available or reasonably anticipated ventilation or air cleaning system that can adequately control and significantly reduce the health risks of [secondhand smoke] to an acceptable level.”
These lounges are just the modern-day version of airplane smoking sections which thankfully were abandoned in the past. They were never about safety. They were about protecting smoking profits at the expense of workers’ lives. It wasn’t acceptable to poison flight attendants, and it’s not acceptable now.
Gov. Dan McKee signed the casino smoking restrictions legislation into law on Wednesday, July 2. Even with its limited protections, the new casino “nonsmoking policy” won’t take effect until January 1, 2027. That means casino workers are expected to gamble on their health and breathe toxic secondhand smoke for at least 18 more months, and we’re paying with our lives. Delaying protections until 2027 sends a message that our health is negotiable. It shouldn’t be. 
I am so grateful to the workers, advocates, and legislators (including my state representative, Rep. Teresa Tanzi and House Speaker Joe Shekarchi) who pushed for these smoking restrictions, but the job isn’t done. We won’t stop fighting until lawmakers close this loophole and all workers are fully protected. Casino employees deserve the same right to clean air that bartenders, servers and every other Rhode Island employee already enjoys.
We’ve waited long enough. Lawmakers did the hard part by making this a priority. Now it’s time to finish what they started — and finally get it right. Our lungs can’t wait 18 more months.

(Nathaniel Cline/Virginia Mercury)Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin and Virginia Democrats have brokered many deals during his soon-ending four-year term, but have also frequently been at odds on policy issues, reflected most recently in the legislature’s rejection of several of the governor’s appointments to Virginia’s governing boards and commissions.
Virginia law gives governors the power to appoint and remove people to these groups. Like his predecessors, Youngkin has appointed hundreds of people to serve on roughly 300 public commissions and boards. 
Over the past year, Senate Democrats have rejected 30 of Youngkin’s appointments to boards and commissions, primarily to the Board of Education and governing boards at Virginia’s public higher education institutions. That is three times as many appointees as the legislature blocked during former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam’s administration, which ended in 2022.
Senate Democrats sue over Youngkin appointees kept on college boards

Now, the board appointments process is being debated publicly and will soon play out in the Fairfax County Courthouse, as officials decide whether the rejected appointees can still serve.
To better understand how the process works, the Mercury spoke with two professors from the University of Richmond and Virginia Commonwealth University about the state laws girding up gubernatorial appointment confirmations.
 How may someone be appointed to a governing board or commission?

A candidate can be considered through two methods: self-application or nomination by someone else. 
Self-application would require the candidate to consider their area of interest and then complete an application through a web portal managed by the Office of Secretary of the Commonwealth.

“It’s prestigious, it’s a lot of work, and that’s not everybody’s cup of tea,” said Carl Tobias, law professor at the University of Richmond. 
Candidates may also be nominated, including by a member of the governor’s administration, and be submitted through the web portal. These roles are traditionally nonpartisan, although they can be recommended to join a board by a Democratic or Republican administration. “But my sense is that (a candidate) is often somebody who’s a pretty strong supporter of the governor,” Tobias said.
Alex Keena, associate professor of political science at VCU, said there can be several vacancies in a single year due to term limits on appointments.
“They’re about 900 appointments made in a typical year, so there’s constant vacancies. Some of those are because these positions are term-limited, or appointments last for a designated amount of time, and other times people leave,” Keena said.
Most of Virginia’s boards and commissions have specific appointment qualifications outlined in the Code of Virginia. All candidates are also required to meet the state’s Code of Conduct. Successful candidates will later be required to complete a financial disclosure statement. Board appointees are voluntary roles, with some exceptions, but are sometimes reimbursed for travel expenses. 
 What is the governor’s role?

Simply put, the governor can appoint candidates to governing boards and commissions, and even nominate them. The three types of boards and commissions are advisory, policy and supervisory.
Keena said one of his observations is that each governor’s fields of expertise have helped identify candidates for specific boards. Youngkin comes from a business background that likely informed his opinions on business or commerce-related boards. In contrast, his predecessor, Northam, had experience in the medical field and worked in the Virginia legislature as a senator and then lieutenant governor, roles that probably influenced his appointee choices. 
“I think every governor has the leeway to find appointments, however they like, (but) are certainly not bound by this application system,” Keena said. ​​

The governor also has the authority to remove a confirmed appointment from office.
Youngkin recently booted Bert Ellis from the University of Virginia for violating the state’s Code of Conduct for state boards and commissions, as well as the Board of Visitors’ Statement of Visitor Responsibilities. 
Ellis’ strong support of eliminating diversity, equity and inclusion policies at UVA triggered protests by the school’s faculty senate, student government council and campus newspaper this year, but Youngkin did not expand on the specific violations that led to his decision to remove Ellis.
According to state law, the governor may remove an appointee from office for several reasons, including failure to carry out the policies of the commonwealth, and may fill the vacancy with an appointee of their choosing, subject to confirmation by the General Assembly.
 What is the General Assembly’s role?

After the governor has compiled the list of appointments, the Secretary of the Commonwealth must provide copies of the appointees’ resumes and statements of economic interests to the chairs of the House of Delegates and the Senate Committees on Privileges and Elections.
The Senate typically takes up voting on the appointments before the House of Delegates votes. In certain instances, the lists of appointments have been updated to include additional members.
Va. lawmakers reject latest Youngkin appointees to university boards

The state code states that a joint subcommittee, composed of five members from the House and three from the Senate, will be appointed by the respective chairs to review the resumes and statements of economic interests of gubernatorial appointees.
Keena said the state law is not clear on when the General Assembly is supposed to act on appointments. Since Virginia’s legislature is part-time, lawmakers meet annually on the second Tuesday in January, typically for 30 days during odd-numbered years and 60 days during even-numbered years and usually confirm appointments during that time.
The governor can also call back lawmakers for special sessions. 
This year’s appointment confirmation process was different. Because the Senate did not recess from its 2024 General Assembly Session, the Senate Committee on Privileges and Elections returned on June 9 to take up the governor’s appointments. 
By the meeting’s end, Democrats rejected eight appointees, after having rejected nine appointments during the regular session in January. 
During the June 9 meeting, Republican lawmakers questioned why the joint subcommittee had not met to review the appointees’ statements and economic interests, as required by state code. 
The Senate committee’s attorney replied he was not aware of whether the subcommittee was currently active. 
Tobias said that he believes the vetting process by lawmakers adds a “check” on the governor’s power and promotes interaction between the legislative and executive branches. Keena added that vetting candidates has historically been a practice in Virginia and across the country. 
“This is just part of checks and balances. The governor has the power to make the appointment, but it needs to be confirmed by the General Assembly, and that’s part of the legislative oversight,” Keena said.
If the General Assembly does not confirm an appointment, Virginia law states no appointment “shall enter upon, or continue in” office after being refused. They shall also not be eligible for reappointment when the General Assembly is not in session.
“If they refuse, then that’s it. You’re done,” Keena said. 
That law sets the state forSenate Democrats’ lawsuit on whether leaders at three of Virginia’s universities broke the rules by allowing rejected appointees — including former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli and former state commerce and trade secretary Caren Merrick — to remain on their governing boards after being rejected by the Senate Privileges and Elections Committee.
The governor’s administration believes that the appointees are allowed to continue serving until the General Assembly reconvenes.
Tobias said the state code’s lack of clarity about whether the vote by the Senate Committee on Elections and Privileges represents the entire Senate has led to the contention between the governor’s administration and Senate Democrats.
“It doesn’t say House and Senate. It says General Assembly; so that’s an interesting wrinkle,” Tobias said.
 Does the legislature track the number of confirmations?

The House of Delegates does not track the number of appointment confirmations, the Mercury confirmed, nor does the Senate. 
However, both chambers keep a record of related actions taken by lawmakers.
As of July 10, the General Assembly has rejected 30 of Youngkin’s 3,523 appointments to Virginia’s boards and commissions. That’s in comparison to his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, who had 10 of his 2,941 appointees blocked by the legislature.
The totals exclude cabinet and agency appointments.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Northam’s time in office began when the entire legislature was controlled by Republicans, which rejected only nine appointees; seven of those were for the Board of Regents of the James Monroe Law Office Museum and Memorial Library. However, after two years, Democrats took control of both chambers, rejecting only one appointment. 
As for Youngkin, the governor has always faced a Democratic-controlled Senate Committee over the past four years. With his help, Republicans regained control of the House at the start of his term, but lost power to Democrats in late 2023. Most of the rejections have been for public boards and commissions about K-12 education, higher education and the Virginia Parole Board.
 Are there any other legal nuances of appointment confirmations?

Yes, the experts said, but they are buried in the state code.
In the 1970s, lawmakers revised the Virginia Constitution to transfer some control of state governance from the legislature to the governor. But they also created inconsistencies regarding when appointments can begin serving on their respective boards and commissions. In many cases, appointments begin serving before they are confirmed.
“It really depends on the board,” Keena said. “There’s general state law that governs the process by which these appointments are made, and the role of the General Assembly, and each board has its own set of rules.”
One law has been revised to establish a special process that allows the governor to make recess appointments to the Board of Education, according to Keena. However, the law governing the boards of Virginia’s higher education institutions does not include specific language regarding the power to appoint someone to fill a vacancy. 
Not all of the roughly 300 boards have a special process for appointing vacancies. Keena said such a process could be added to state code due to the size of the board or commission, or the frequency of their meetings during the year.

The ACA is a 15-year-old federal law that allows people who don’t have employer-provided insurance to purchase their own through the ACA marketplace. Congress also created associated tax credits that have helped some offset those costs even further. Over 261,000 people in Virginia have Aetna healthcare, according to the Virginia Department of Medical Assistance Services. 
Aetna is under the CVS umbrella and has participated in the ACA marketplace. Recipients have received emails this summer alerting them of the forthcoming change and the company website outlines it as well. 
“As we considered plan options for the future, it became clear we would not be able to provide the same level of value we’ve offered in prior years,” the health insurer’s website stated. 
Both the online statement and a request for comment from CVS Health did not clarify what made it “clear” the company felt the need to withdraw, but the shifting federal health care policy landscape could be part of the equation.
Congress has yet to renew ACA tax credits that further help people lower their premium payments and the recently-passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act did not extend the credits either.
As partisan disputes boil, it’s still unclear how new federal law will impact Medicaid in Virginia

Relatedly, the OBBB includes forthcoming changes to hospital funding and Medicaid (another provision of ACA that helps insure pregnant people, children, those with disabilities and lower-income earners). 
The Republican-led megabill fielded opposition from Democratic and some Republican federal lawmakers but ultimately passed and was signed by President Donald Trump on July 4. Republican dominance in Congress also threatens the renewal of the ACA tax credits that help people purchase insurance in state marketplaces, which Democrats have championed.
An Aetna spokeswoman did not directly respond when asked if Congress’ pending renewal or failure to renew ACA tax credits had anything to do with the decision. She did reiterate the same statement from the website that CVS remains “committed to helping members make the most of their benefits in 2025.” 
An email forwarded to The Mercury by a reader with Aetna insurance outlines how clients will need to shop for a new insurer when the 2026 enrollment period opens in the fall. 
“You will get more information and helpful guidance as open enrollment approaches,” the Aetna letter reads. 
Aetna’s recent communication to clients follows NPR reporting that Aetna would be withdrawing from the ACA marketplace back in May. Since then, as Congress debated the OBBB, lawmakers and hospital professionals around the nation and in Virginia have expressed concerns about what shrinking health care coverage options might mean across all income brackets.
“As uninsured rates climb, so too will health care costs for everyone,” said U.S. Rep. Jennifer McClellan, D-Richmond.

Roughly 310,000 people across Georgia are projected to lose access to health insurance by 2034 under the bill. Getty ImagesAs the dust settles in the wake of President Donald Trump’s “big, beautiful bill,” — the massive spending cut and tax break package signed into law early this month — it’s becoming clearer that Georgia’s health care landscape may look dramatically different in 2026.
Health insurers, providers and advocates alike are bracing for the impact that the federal budget reconciliation bill will have on health care access throughout the state over the next decade. The bill’s sweeping Medicaid cuts are expected to reduce federal health care funding in Georgia by $2.29 billion, according to data from the nonprofit health policy research organization KFF. 
In addition, roughly 310,000 people across Georgia are projected to lose access to health insurance by 2034. That number could rise to 750,000 if Congress allows enhanced tax credits for those insured through the Affordable Care Act to expire this year.
The policy changes have alarmed health policy experts, who anticipate that the bill will bring drastic changes to the U.S. health care landscape over the next decade.
“This bill was not framed as a health care reform effort, but it represents the biggest change to the health care system since the passage of the Affordable Care Act 15 years ago,” said Larry Levitt, KFF’s executive vice president for health policy. “And in effect, it amounts to what is effectively a partial repeal of the ACA, erasing a lot of its gains in health coverage.”
“The scale of the change to the health care system is staggering,” he added. “This represents the biggest rollback in federal support for health coverage ever.”
A Georgia Recorder analysis found that 45 health care facilities across 35 Georgia counties risk reducing services or closing altogether due to the bill’s spending cuts. Those facilities include hospitals, nursing homes and Planned Parenthood centers across both urban and rural parts of the state, all of which will likely face funding gaps under the budget reconciliation bill.


Rural hospitals face funding shortfall
Hospitals in rural parts of the state, many of which rely on funding from Medicaid to sustain their facilities, may be among the hardest hit health care providers under the new bill. 
That includes four hospitals in rural Georgia: Fannin Regional Hospital in Blue Ridge, Flint River Community Hospital in Montezuma, Irwin County Hospital in Ocilla and Washington County Regional Medical Center in Sandersville. Three of those hospitals are in counties represented by Republican congressmen who voted in favor of the bill, and all four border at least one county that lacks its own hospital.
HomeTown Health CEO Jimmy Lewis said he and his organization’s network of rural hospitals are bracing for the changes handed down by Washington, though they are not sure yet what the full impact will be.
“The ability to plan around the uncertainty is a nightmare,” he said. “The only thing we can tell [hospitals] on this particular occasion is that you just must be prepared for the most draconian cuts imaginable as we go forward.” 
For the rural hospitals in his network, Lewis said, government funding makes up the vast majority of their income. Roughly 60% of payments come from Medicare and Medicare Advantage, with Medicaid payments making up another 20%. Private insurers and self-funded payers make up only a small portion of rural hospital incomes.
“That’s a real problem, because Medicaid typically pays 85.6% of cost,” he said. “Medicare pays, at best, about cost, and any variation that occurs to that, for example, self pay, typically pays seven to 10% of cost. So over a normal matrix, we start out losing money.” 
“It’s not uncommon at all for rural hospitals to operate with three to 10 days’ cash with a $30 to $40 million operation,” he added.
And when hospitals are forced to reduce services or close entirely, Lewis said, the effects ripple out into the entire community, forcing residents to drive further to access care and depleting local job opportunities. Labor and delivery unit closures, which have been on the rise nationwide since 2020, often serve as a bellwether for the broader impact of hospital closures in rural areas, Lewis added.
“We closed about 14 OB units in the last five to 10 years,” Lewis said. “That’s a real problem. Not only is that a health care delivery system for babies, but it’s an economic development system for the community. And when you lose it, you lose economic development opportunities in a big time fashion.”
The federal bill includes a $50 billion fund aimed at helping offset some of the costs for providers in rural areas, and Georgia’s Department of Community Health board voted to increase Medicaid funding to hospitals by $2 billion in an emergency meeting last month, a move that must be approved by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. But experts are skeptical that the funds will go far enough to prevent hospital closures in the long term.
The rural health fund “will certainly help in rural communities, but it won’t fully compensate for the cuts, especially since it’s temporary and the cuts are permanent,” said KFF’s Levitt.
Tax credit expirations leave Georgia families hanging
The expiration of ACA enhanced premium tax credits, which were first introduced in 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan Act, poses another barrier for Georgia residents seeking health care access. 
The credits currently help subsidize health care premiums for families with incomes up to 400% of the federal poverty line (which comes out to $62,600 for a single-person household and $128,600 for a household of 4), and are associated with record high ACA enrollment levels. In Georgia, which saw ACA enrollment triple between 2020 and 2024, 96% of enrollees use advanced premium tax credits to cover some or all of their health care costs.
The credits are set to expire at the end of this year, and Congress has yet to renew them, meaning families may have to start paying higher premiums for health care coverage as early as January 2026.
Data from the Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, estimates that Georgia families could end up paying an average of $528 more per year, which amounts to an 85% increase on health care premiums. Residents of some counties are projected to spend up to $900 more annually.
Health care advocates worry that the higher premiums will result in fewer Georgia residents obtaining coverage, with some families being priced out of the health insurance market entirely. Georgia already has one of the highest uninsured rates in the country. 
“Because Georgia has not expanded Medicaid, we have more low-income individuals enrolled in the marketplace or Georgia Access than most states,” said Whitney Griggs, the director of health policy at Georgians for a Healthy Future, a patient advocacy group. “Those folks are going to feel the pain of these premium increases the most.” 
Though certain parts of the budget reconciliation bill likely won’t impact taxpayers until 2027 or beyond, higher insurance premiums may debut as soon as January 2026.
As a result, state lawmakers will likely have to choose between directing more state funds towards health care programs or allowing service cuts to take effect, with health policy experts hoping that the state’s multibillion dollar budget surplus could be used to help supplement the federal funding gap.
“We have been operating with a budget surplus that is above and beyond our undesignated reserves,” said Leah Chan, director of health justice at the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. “So our state has clearly shown that we are setting our revenue estimates very conservatively, and there might be an opportunity to use more of the state revenue that we’re receiving to meet people’s basic needs.”

(Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)At least a quarter of hospitals in seven states closed their obstetric services between 2010 and 2022, according to a new study in the journal Health Affairs. And in six states, more than 60% of hospitals lacked obstetrics by 2022.
Using data from the American Hospital Association and federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the researchers analyzed obstetric services at short-term acute care hospitals between 2010 and 2022.
The study included 4,964 hospitals.


On Tuesday, July 15, at 7 p.m. the Newport City Council holds a special meeting at Newport City Hall to consider a resolution supporting the continued operation of the Noreen Stonor Drexel Birthing Center at Newport Hospital. The resolution acknowledges that Newport Hospital’s new CEO “faces the critical challenge of advocating for the preservation of essential healthcare services” as its owner Brown University Health is confronting budget constraints.


Rural states saw the most profound losses. The states with the highest percentage of all hospitals lacking obstetrics by 2022 were: North Dakota (73%), Oklahoma (63%), West Virginia (62%), Louisiana (60%), South Dakota (60%) and Mississippi (60%).
The study sheds further light on the nation’s growing maternity health care deserts. At 18.6 per 100,000 live births, the U.S. has a maternal mortality rate far higher than other high-income nations. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 80% of maternal deaths in the U.S. are preventable.
The “steady march of closures” has been an ongoing problem, said Katy Kozhimannil, University of Minnesota professor and lead author of the study.
Hospital leaders and experts have warned that Congress’ Medicaid cuts could have a ripple effect, leading to many hospitals no longer able to afford their labor and delivery units, which are expensive to maintain.
“Those programs are a primary source of support for maternity care,” Kozhimannil said. “Without changes to maternity care financing and organization, I expect that the trends that we have seen over the past couple of decades will likely continue.”
A dozen states saw a quarter or more losses of obstetric services among hospitals in rural counties, the study found.

Across rural counties in Pennsylvania and South Carolina, close to half of hospitals — 46% — lost obstetrics between 2010 and 2022.
Those two states saw the highest percentage of hospitals losing obstetrics, followed by West Virginia (about 43%), Florida (40%) and Iowa (nearly 40%).
Along with Washington, D.C., urban counties in four states — Hawaii, Kansas, Oklahoma  and Rhode Island — saw at least a quarter of hospitals lose obstetrics.
By 2022, two-thirds of rural hospitals in eight states (Alabama, Florida, Illinois, Mississippi, Nevada, North Dakota, Oklahoma and West Virginia) were without obstetric services.
Three states — Delaware, Utah and Vermont — had no obstetric losses between 2010 and 2022, the authors wrote.

It’s no secret that bipartisanship is in short supply these days in state politics and that fact makes it especially tragic, as has happened recently at the state legislature, when opportunities for finding common ground are casually and cynically trashed.
See, for example, an important bill designed to prevent people from being victimized by revenge porn that passed the state House 113-0.
Unfortunately, when it got to the Senate, Republican leaders packed the bill with several right-wing culture war agenda items – including provisions to ban school books and deny health care to transgender people.
A similar thing happened to a bipartisan bill designed to target squatters on private property. It was amended to prevent local governments from regulating puppy mills.
The amendments forced Gov. Stein, rightfully, to veto both bills.
The bottom line: North Carolinians deserve better. If GOP leaders want to advance a conservative policy agenda, they should have the courage to let their proposals rise and fall on their own merit without hijacking important, consensus legislation.

(Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)The Maine Legislature largely opted to maintain the status quo regarding campaign finance regulations this year, rejecting attempts to expand clean elections, require more transparency into who is spending in elections and ban direct corporate contributions to candidates.  
The most common reasons cited by lawmakers, who voted down many of these bills in committee before the proposals even reached the chambers, were the tight budget year and that the plans didn’t get to the root causes of money in politics.
“We really took this as that campaign finance reform was not a priority at all during this legislative session in a time where money and politics is rampant and at an all time high,” said Al Cleveland, advocacy director for Democracy Maine, a collaboration of nonpartisan organizations focused on making government more equitable.
Before the Legislature’s Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee voted down one of the bills that sought to require the disclosure of the original source of what’s frequently referred to as “dark money,” discussion illuminated a sense of resignation on this topic held by lawmakers.
“I don’t think all the laws that we pass are going to change money in politics,” said Sen. Jeff Timberlake (R-Androscoggin) during the April 16 work session. “It’s the way of life now. I wish it wasn’t.” 
Rep. Anne Graham (D-North Yarmouth) offered a similar view, pointing to the U.S. Supreme Court decision in 2010, Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which overturned century-old campaign finance restrictions by allowing corporations and unions to spend unlimited funds on elections.
“The reality is,” Graham said, “until Congress repeals Citizens United, we’re faced with this dilemma.” 
The rejection of these bills comes at a time when there is a strong appetite for change among the public. Maine voters overwhelmingly passed laws in the past two general elections to place stricter regulations on money in politics, with both including measures aimed at overturning Citizens United in different ways. However, those changes have so far been blocked as legal battles play out in the courts. 
On Friday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit sided with the plaintiffs in one of the lawsuits against the 2023 law, which prohibited foreign government spending in elections. The judge ruled the law is likely unconstitutional and affirmed the district court’s preliminary injunction. 
Maine Legislature eyes campaign finance reforms as courts weigh voter-backed referenda

“I think our state lawmakers are often left unsure how to handle the big, big issues and so then they fear that the smaller reforms won’t be as effective as all their dreams might be,” Cleveland said. “But, if we’re going to ever get to a place where we can truly instigate true campaign finance reform and really reduce the money on politics, we need to have all of these different policies in place already.”
With restrictions on the types of bills that can be introduced during the second regular session that begins next year, and given that lawmakers already considered and rejected campaign finance-related proposals, it is now unlikely for major change to be reconsidered, at least legislatively, until the next Legislature in 2027. 
What passed
Two bills on this topic did pass, though offer only small tweaks within the existing campaign finance landscape. 
LD 9, submitted by Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) on behalf of the Maine Commission on Governmental Ethics and Election Practices, raises penalties for what are considered “straw” donations, which are already illegal in Maine but difficult to detect. These are donations funneled to support or oppose a specific political group or candidate through an intermediary, however the name of the original donor is not disclosed. 
For example, in November 2023, the commission completed an enforcement proceeding regarding a $150,000 donation from Alpine Initiatives through an intermediary to the Maine Democratic Party. At that time, the actual donor was not disclosed. 
This new law will also require that the name of a person or group who paid more than $500 for a campaign text expressly advocating for or against a candidate has to be included in the text so the public knows who is behind it. 
The other bill, LD 390, sponsored by Sen. Stacy Brenner (D-Cumberland), levels the playing field for enrolled and unenrolled candidates when it comes to qualifying contributions.
Because unenrolled candidates don’t have primary races, they’d previously only had the general election period to reach the cap on funds they’re allowed to accept from any one person, whereas enrolled candidates had two periods due to primaries and therefore the opportunity to raise more. 
While the bill initially sought to raise the contribution limit of independent candidates, the version passed took the approach of instead providing both types of candidates two election periods. 
Anticipating some people would argue the bill increases the role of money in politics, Brenner said when presenting it to the committee, “I agree that money in politics is a concern. But, within the system we have, the rules must be fair.”
What failed
Meanwhile, bills that sought to expand clean elections, ban corporate contributions to candidates and require more transparency into who is spending in elections all failed. 










It seems like the one thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is keeping the current dysfunctional system in place.


– Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford)


Clean Elections
Maine was a pioneer in public campaign financing but has rejected recent attempts to further expand clean elections. 
In 2000, Maine became one of two states to implement a clean elections model of campaign finance reform, marking the first time candidates for statewide offices — governor, state senator and state representative — were able to fully fund their campaigns with public money. 
This session, three separate attempts to expand the program to more offices failed. 
LD 118, sponsored by Sen. Rick Bennett (R-Oxford) and bipartisan co-sponsors, would have allowed candidates for district attorney and sheriff to participate. Last legislative session, lawmakers passed a narrower bill to allow candidates for just district attorney to participate, but Gov. Janet Mills did not sign the proposal or any of the bills the Legislature enacted when lawmakers reconvened for the final day of the session in 2024.
“We have lost ground,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star, “and I think there is a sense of fatalistic capitulation to the dysfunctional status quo, which is prevailing in the Legislature these days.”
Meanwhile, LD 1787 had initially proposed adding district attorney, sheriff and county commissioners to the program. But lawmakers removed those sections and instead passed the bill solely as a measure to change the amount of “seed money” gubernatorial candidates can receive, which is private money that candidates can raise to get their campaign off the ground and qualify for clean elections.
Efforts to expand Maine clean elections reckon with currently inadequate program funding

LD 454, sponsored by Sen. Joe Baldacci (D-Penobscot), would have added candidates for secretary of state and attorney general to the program, contingent on those constitutional officers being changed to popularly elected positions. 
Maine is an outlier in having its Legislature appoint constitutional officers and state auditors. All of the bills that sought to switch the system to allowing the public to decide through a direct popular election failed this year, so LD 454 ultimately couldn’t become law either.
Some Democrats said that they would have supported the switch if the offices were elected through ranked-choice voting, a system Maine voters passed in 2016 to allow voters to rank political candidates for governor, state legislature and Congress by preference. 
Meanwhile, most Republicans would likely be against having such offices elected through ranked-choice voting. Separately, the Legislature rejected a bill proposed by Republicans this year that sought to do away with ranked-choice voting altogether. 
Baldacci told Maine Morning Star he’s interested in introducing a bill in the future that incorporates all three components — popular election, clean elections and ranked-choice voting — but he doesn’t see that as an option until the next Legislature, if he is reelected in 2026. Given that the general proposal was already rejected this year, he sees it as unlikely legislative leadership would allow him to introduce the three-pronged approach next year. 
The budget passed this year provided what has become a typical $3 million allocation for clean elections, however LD 1787 had originally called for increasing funding to $3.5 million, which Cleveland from Democracy Maine described as crucial not only to expand the program but to ensure multiple candidates are able to access the fund each election. 
“We’re really concerned about the Clean Elections fund not being sustainable,” Cleveland said. 
The Maine Ethics Commission has raised concern about allocations not being enough if more than just two gubernatorial candidates run under the program in 2026. 
So far only one candidate is running under the program, current Republican Sen. James Libby. Bennett, who is leaving the Republican party to run as an independent for governor, said he chose not to run under clean elections because of fear that there wouldn’t be sufficient funding. 
“In terms of increasing the Clean Elections fund and expanding clean elections with what the Legislature is going to have to deal with all the federal budget cuts, there is probably not going to be a lot of political room to make that happen,” Cleveland said, referring to President Donald Trumps’ spending bill, “but we will continue advocating and educating about it.”
Who can spend and who knows about it
In 2021, Maine passed a law that made several changes to campaign finance law, including banning direct corporate contributions to candidates and leadership PACs, which are controlled by legislators. But lawmakers repealed the law shortly after in 2023, with some supporters arguing it was unfair to businesses and others that the law lacked clarity.
This year, LD 1350 attempted to reinstate the part of the law that banned corporate contributions, but it was unanimously rejected by the Veterans and Legal Affairs Committee and both chambers later followed suit. 
Currently, 23 states completely prohibit corporations from contributing to political campaigns, and federal law prohibits such direct contributions in connection to federal elections. 
Bennett reintroduced a bill to increase transparency regarding who spends money in elections, but it died again this year, also after being unanimously rejected by the committee.  
The bill, LD 951, would have required political action committees that receive contributions of at least $10,000 from a single contributor and spend more than $50,000 in Maine elections to disclose the original source of those funds. It was based on a similar law in Arizona. 
Donors frequently obscure their political activity by giving to a politically oriented nonprofit, which then donates money to a candidate. Ordinarily, campaign disclosure laws would only list the nonprofit as the source of the money.
Maine Citizens for Clean Elections supported this measure, with attorney John Brautigam pointing the committee to polls that show Americans of all political persuasions overwhelmingly support disclosure of such donations. But the Maine Education Association, Maine Conservation Voters, Planned Parenthood and other groups were opposed, arguing the requirements in LD 951 go too far and threaten the personal safety contributors. 
“It seems like the one thing that Democrats and Republicans can agree on is keeping the current dysfunctional system in place,” Bennett told Maine Morning Star. “Any one of these things by themselves won’t do it, but we do need a different approach.”

The House passed the sweeping tax and spending bill after winning over fiscal hawks and moderate Republicans. The bill makes permanent President Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts, increases spending on defense and immigration enforcement, and temporarily cuts taxes on tips, while at the same time cutting funding for Medicaid, food assistance for the poor, and clean energy. It also raises the nation's debit limit by $5 trillion. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)When Michelle Lawrence heard about the Medicaid cuts included in the Republican tax and spending bill signed into law on July 4, it felt like “a punch to the gut.”
“I laugh, because if I don’t laugh, I cry,” she said.
Lawrence, who lives in Henniker, was diagnosed with a chronic form of cancer called T-cell lymphocytic leukemia 16 years ago. She said she lost her job about five years ago because the cancer was making it too difficult for her to work. And in losing her job, she lost her health insurance because she couldn’t afford COBRA coverage or anything on the marketplace.
“So I applied for Medicaid, which has been a major lifeline for me,” she continued. “That has enabled me and a lot of other cancer patients like me to be able to access the treatment needed in the past few years. I’m here. I’m alive and a contributing member of society. … Without Medicaid, I wouldn’t be able to afford my treatments or go to the doctor.”
Lawrence works 40 hours a month at a nonprofit assisting people with disabilities. Between the symptoms of her cancer and the side effects of her treatment, she can’t work any more than that, she said. But the “big beautiful bill” adds a work requirement to Medicaid that requires people to work 80 hours per month to receive coverage.
“Those 40 hours a month are hard for me to do. I have had cancer for 16 years,” she said. “I can’t create a healthier Michelle that’s going to be able to work 80 hours. If I could, I would have by now, because I’d rather be working. No one wants to be sick and no one wants to be unable to work.”
The bill includes exceptions to the work requirements for “serious and complex medical conditions,” but it’s still unclear if that exemption will apply to all cancer patients, just some cancer patients, or no cancer patients at all. Lawrence said she asked the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, the agency responsible for administering Medicaid in the state, but officials there didn’t have an answer for her. 
“And that’s the scary part,” Lawrence said. “It feels like the Wild, Wild West. So we passed this bill, and now it’s left up to interpretation, and I don’t think that’s reasonable, because what am I supposed to do? Like, just carry on and wait to find out if or if not I get kicked off? Should I be planning a funeral instead of my next doctor’s appointment?”
The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed by the Republican-controlled Congress and signed by President Donald Trump, affects huge swaths of the federal government’s services, budget, and tax code. The bill extends a set of tax cuts enacted in a signature piece of legislation from the first Trump administration, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. And it makes deep cuts to social services in order to partially pay for the tax breaks, though independent bipartisan analysis from the Congressional Budget Office still projects the bill will increase the federal deficit. The bill also includes a number of other tax and unrelated provisions. The effective date of those provisions varies, with some changes — such as some of the Medicaid cuts — set to take effect after the 2026 midterm elections.
The cuts will leave states with tough decisions about whether to cover the new funding holes with state money — a big challenge for states like New Hampshire that are in tight budget cycles of their own — or cut the programs.
Asked about her thoughts on the bill and whether the state should pay to fill those gaps, Republican Gov. Kelly Ayotte provided a statement to the Bulletin: “We are evaluating the impact of the recently passed federal legislation on New Hampshire. I disagree with federal reductions to SNAP and Medicaid benefits and will work closely with DHHS to protect our most vulnerable citizens.” 
New Hampshire’s delegation dissents
The bill has been lambasted by Democrats, including the four members of New Hampshire’s congressional delegation, all Democrats who voted against the bill.
“What this president calls the big beautiful bill, I call the big beautiful betrayal of the American people,” Sen. Jeanne Shaheen said during a press conference Tuesday. “This bill takes food and health care away from seniors and families to give trillions of dollars more to corporations and to the wealthiest.”
First District Rep. Chris Pappas, who represents the eastern half of the state, called the bill “a disaster for the American people.”
“It’s a cruel bill that contains deep cuts that are going to impact our families, our neighbors, all across the state of New Hampshire,” he said. “This is decidedly unpopular here in New Hampshire … But the fact is, our colleagues across the aisle, it’s not that they didn’t hear it, it’s that they didn’t listen to what people were actually saying.”
Pappas is vacating his seat in the House of Representatives at the end of this term in order to run for Senate in 2026. Scott Brown, one of his Republican opponents in that election, did not respond to the Bulletin’s request for an interview, but he has publicly targeted Pappas for his vote against the bill, writing on social media, “Pappas will side with left-wing partisans in Congress over the people of New Hampshire and the tax certainty in the budget reconciliation package.”
“I proudly support President Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill because working families deserve a break,” Brown wrote in a separate post, pointing specifically to provisions that eliminate taxes on tips and overtime.
Tax cuts felt by the rich and the deficit
An analysis from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based fiscal think tank, shows the bill’s tax benefits are heavily skewed to America’s wealthiest. The richest fifth of Americans are set to receive roughly 72% of the net tax benefits in the bill in 2026, while the middle fifth would receive roughly 10%. The poorest fifth would receive less than 1% of the benefits, according to the analysis. Put in other terms, the richest 1% of Americans would get about 22% of the bill’s tax benefits in 2026.
In New Hampshire, the top 1% of households are expected to receive 16% of the bill’s tax benefits, according to the same think tank’s analysis. Those households, which earn more than $894,699 annually, are expected to pay $59,170 less in taxes over the course of 2026, on average. The poorest 20% of New Hampshire households, on the other hand, will receive 1% of the bill’s tax benefits. Those households, which earn less than $37,000, are expected to get $200 in annual savings across 2026.
Many fiscal conservatives embraced the tax cut portion of the bill. Much of the bill’s tax policy is an extension of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The Josiah Bartlett Center for Public Policy, a New Hampshire-based conservative think tank, championed those changes and was happy to see them extended.
“To the extent that One Big Beautiful Bill Act makes permanent the 2017 tax rates and does some expansion in terms of business tax deductions … that’s good,” Drew Cline, the organization’s executive director, said. “Those 2017 changes were designed to achieve two main goals: One was to simplify the code, and the other was to stimulate growth. So to the extent that the new bill furthers those goals, those are positive.”
Cline acknowledged that the bill’s tax benefits primarily go to the wealthiest Americans, but he dismissed that as a concern “because the rich are the ones who pay the vast majority of income taxes” already. He argued that the U.S. tax code is currently very progressive, so any tax benefits would be felt by those paying the most taxes already. (Other think tanks disagree on the U.S. tax code’s progressivity; the Brookings Institution, for example, argues the tax code is less progressive relative to peer countries including the U.K., Canada, Spain, Greece, Japan, Germany, and Australia, among others, and is becoming less progressive over time.)
Still, Cline isn’t entirely on board with the bill. He’s not a fan of how tax exemptions for tips and overtime included in the bill will complicate the tax code, which he believes should be simplified. More importantly, Cline is worried about the deficit. The Congressional Budget Office predicts the bill will add $3.4 trillion to the federal deficit across the coming decade.
“The bigger story here is that we are spending and we are borrowing at crisis levels when we don’t have a crisis,” he said. “And that is not sustainable.”
The biggest cut to Medicaid in U.S. history
The bill cuts Medicaid nearly $1 trillion over the next decade through a number of different provisions. In New Hampshire specifically, the bill is expected to revoke 18% of New Hampshire’s federal baseline spending for Medicaid, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s $3 billion over 10 years. Medicaid, which is funded and operated jointly by state and federal governments, covers roughly 186,000 people in New Hampshire, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
One of the biggest changes to Medicaid is the new work requirements. Opponents of work requirements argue that a vast majority of Medicaid enrollees are already working, that the paperwork and bureaucracy required to prove eligibility is too burdensome for states to do effectively, and that many people — like Lawrence, the cancer patient — are not only too sick to meet the requirement but often not well enough to complete the bureaucratic process of proving they can’t work.
Work requirements have been unsuccessfully attempted at the state level a few times, including in New Hampshire. In 2018, the state enacted a law mandating Medicaid enrollees work 100 hours a month to receive coverage. However, about one month after the rule went into effect in 2019, only about 8,000 of the 25,000 people subject to the requirement complied and documented their hours. At that point, then-Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, intervened and paused the new system before the remaining roughly 17,000 people lost coverage. The state had spent more than $130,000 in outreach efforts to inform recipients of the requirements and to teach them how to complete the eligibility paperwork. Arkansas and Georgia have also tried to implement work requirements. Arkansas had similar issues until a federal judge intervened and blocked the law.
The cuts also come at the same time as a number of changes to Medicaid at the state level. The New Hampshire state budget signed into law in June increases prescription co-pays and charges some enrollees premiums. The budget, which was passed before the federal bill, also enacts work requirements. However, details on the state work requirements have yet to be ironed out and need to be submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. It’s also unclear how the state rule would work in relation to the new federal requirements.
U.S. Sen. Maggie Hassan, a former governor who oversaw New Hampshire’s expansion of Medicaid in 2014 before being elected to the Senate, called the bill “the largest cut to Medicaid we have seen in our nation’s history.”
Shaheen, her colleague in the Senate, compared the cuts to Republicans’ failed efforts to  repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017.
“We celebrated (in 2017) because we knew that millions of Americans were going to continue to have access to health care,” she said. “Our colleagues in the Senate and the administration are celebrating (now) because millions of Americans are going to lose their access to health care.”
Cuts to SNAP
Laura Milliken,  executive director of NH Hunger Solutions, a statewide advocacy group working to address hunger in New Hampshire, said the bill “is just a world of bad.”
The bill includes significant cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps low-income families pay for food. Those cuts are expected to cause 22.3 million families in the U.S. to lose some or all of their SNAP benefits.
“It just is so, so unnecessary and cruel at a time that we’re all feeling like everything’s expensive,” Milliken said. “People are having difficulty affording their housing, their child care, their medication. It seems like the moment to strengthen our programs that protect low-income folks and not to cut them, and this is such a drastic change in the program.”
The bill passes off much of the administrative cost of SNAP to states, which may or may not be willing or able to take on those costs. The bill also reduces benefits for some recipients by restricting what factors can be taken into account when deciding how much a family receives. The bill also caps future increases to SNAP at the rate of inflation. It bans many migrants (specifically refugees and asylees) from participating in the program (people in the country without legal status were already ineligible). And work requirements will become stricter.
“People are scared,” Milliken said. “People are thinking, ‘Boy, I’m barely making ends meet right now, what am I going to do if my SNAP benefits are cut?’”
Milliken said many of the food pantries in New Hampshire are afraid they won’t be able to keep up with the increased demand they expect to see as the provisions of the bill go into effect. She also noted that because SNAP automatically qualifies kids for free and reduced-price school meals, which in turn qualify schools for federal aid, the changes will likely impact other programs as well.
Milliken said NH Hunger Solutions hopes to work with state officials to try to mitigate the effects the bill will have on food insecurity in New Hampshire.
Other provisions
The omnibus bill also has a myriad of unrelated provisions that touch nearly every segment of the federal government.
For example, the bill eliminates the IRS direct file program, which sought to help Americans file their taxes for free. The bill also limits the dollar amount of student loans graduate and professional students can take out. It also eliminates regulations for nursing home staffing requirements, revokes Medicaid funding from Planned Parenthood, and eliminates several tax credits meant to encourage environmentally friendly practices.

(Photo courtesy of the office of South Florida Democratic U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz)U.S. Democratic representatives characterized the state-run immigrant detention center in the Everglades as a cruel and wasteful political stunt following a guided tour Saturday.
Members of Congress and state legislators who visited the site described seeing bugs on mattresses, toilets and showers that lacked privacy, small food portions, and temperatures between 83 and 85 degrees in the air-conditioned areas.
“There are really disturbing, vile conditions, and this place needs to be shut the hell down,” said South Florida U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of the detention center at the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport.
The South Florida Democrat said 32 men slept in each of the cages with bed bunks and three sinks attached to the toilets. Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier announced hundreds of people started arriving on July 2.
Democrats labeled the tour as sanitized because they couldn’t speak to any of the detainees or staff. Detainees have told the Miami Herald and CBS News that they hadn’t been able to shower, the toilets didn’t flush, and that the food had maggots.
Anna Eskamani, a state representative from Orlando, said Kevin Guthrie, director of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, led the tour. The agency is in charge of the site.
“It was just incredibly dystopian, and a lot of lack of clarity on what rules and procedures are actually being followed as it pertains to those being detained, as it pertains to what their status is,” Eskamani said in a phone interview with Florida Phoenix.
Eskamani is one of five Democrats in the Florida Legislature suing the state after they weren’t allowed to enter the detention center on July 3. FDEM invited Congress members and state lawmakers on Wednesday for the tour Saturday, when U.S. representatives said they were already planning on conducting an oversight visit.
Meanwhile, Kristi Noem, secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, defended conditions at the detention center during a press conference in Tampa on Saturday, saying it was held to the same standards as federal facilities. However, she sidestepped specific questions about the site because it is state-run.
“Any issues that were there have been addressed,” she said. “It’s a fantastic resource for us to be able to utilize in order for a detention facility to repatriate people back home to their home countries.”
Governors in five Republican states have told Noem they want to build detention centers like the one in the Everglades, Noem said. She refused to say which governors expressed interest.
Spring Hill Republican Sen. Baise Ingoglia, an ally of Gov. Ron DeSantis, also visited on Saturday. The senator, possibly in line as DeSantis’ pick as chief financial officer, wrote on X that Democrats’ rhetoric about the detention center didn’t match reality.
“I actually laid down in one of the beds and it was really comfortable, Ingoglia wrote. “So, any complaints about squalor conditions is nothing more than bullsh*t and political theater.”

Promises made.
Promises kept.

“Alligator Alcatraz” is the name Florida’s Republican leadership have give to the camp.
Despite the poor conditions Democrats described, South Florida Democratic Rep. Jared Moskowitz said the detention center shouldn’t be compared to a concentration camp. Moskowitz served as the head of FDEM for two years under DeSantis.
“Listen, it is as bad as it can be, but it is not a concentration camp, and people should not use Holocaust references to describe what’s going on behind us,” he told reporters following the tour.

(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)Elon Musk’s announcement that he plans to form a new political party came easily, with the billionaire simply posting his intentions on his social media platform, X. Now comes the hard part.
If the world’s richest man seriously pursues his goal of standing up what he calls the America Party, Musk will have to navigate a patchwork of state-level requirements to get his party and its candidates on general election ballots across the country.
The two-party system has largely retained its grip on American politics for more than a century. The Tesla CEO has plenty of money, but loosening that grip would test the America Party’s organization and popular support.
Musk enjoyed extraordinary entree into the White House this winter as he led the Department of Government Efficiency task force. But he broke with President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans over the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Trump’s signature domestic policy package containing massive tax cuts and deep reductions to social services funding. The law, which Trump signed July 4, is expected to add more than $4 trillion to the national debt.
Elon Musk fumes tax and spending bill is a ‘disgusting abomination’; GOP senators shrug

“When it comes to bankrupting our country with waste & graft, we live in a one-party system, not a democracy,” Musk wrote on X on July 5. “Today, the America Party is formed to give you back your freedom.”
Musk appeared to signal his party would for now focus on a small number of competitive congressional races, rather than attempting to put forward a nationwide slate of candidates. He posted that one way “to execute” on creating the party would be to “laser-focus” on two or three U.S. Senate seats and eight to 10 House seats. Musk made no mention of running candidates for state legislatures or other state-level offices.
Given the thin margins separating Republican and Democratic control of Congress, electing a few of his third-party candidates would allow members of Congress from the America Party to serve as the deciding vote on contentious measures, Musk wrote.
The nonpartisan Cook Political Report, which ranks U.S. House and Senate races by competitiveness, lists three toss-up Senate seats and 18 toss-up House districts in 2026. All told, competing in those races would require getting on the ballot in 15 states.
A small sample of what Musk would face:

In Michigan, Democratic U.S. Sen. Gary Peters isn’t running for reelection, creating an open race. Candidates of new political parties must gather signatures of registered voters equal to 1% of the total number of votes in the last election for governor, in this case about 44,620. At least 100 voters in each of half of the state’s congressional districts must sign the petitions.
In Georgia, where Democratic U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff is running for reelection, an America Party candidate would need to collect signatures equivalent to 1% of the number of registered voters eligible to vote in the previous election.
In North Carolina, Republican U.S. Sen. Thom Tillis announced he wouldn’t seek reelection after Trump threatened to find a primary opponent because of Tillis’ opposition to the tax and spending bill. If Musk wants to form a political party in the state, he’ll need to gather the signatures of at least 13,979 registered and qualified voters statewide, including at least 200 registered voters from three different congressional districts.
In Ohio, two U.S. House races appear on Cook’s toss-up list: the 9th District, held by Democratic Rep. Marcy Kaptur, and the 13th District, held by Democratic Rep. Emilia Sykes. To register as a minor political party, the America Party would need signatures of voters equal to 1% of the total vote for governor or for president at the most recent election for those offices. The petition would also have to be signed by at least 500 voters within each of at least half the state’s congressional districts.

Nick Troiano, executive director of Unite America, an organization that seeks to improve political representation by advocating open primaries in which all candidates regardless of party compete against each other for the support of voters, said the America Party could shake up politics. But, he added, history demonstrates that without structural change, Musk’s effort is unlikely to truly disrupt the two-party system.

Troiano didn’t take a position on whether Musk should form a new party, but said that if the mogul goes ahead with the idea, the new party should embrace open primaries.
“If Elon wants to help fix our democracy, his new party should build on his support for opening primaries and make nonpartisan election reform the foundation of its efforts,” Troiano said in a statement to Stateline.
Of course, Musk’s America Party would be far from the first third-party effort. The Green Party, the Libertarian Party and other minor parties all put forward candidates in elections across the country at all levels of the ballot — from contests for governor up to president.
Musk’s gambit could potentially work, said Bob Beatty, a political science professor at Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Independent and third-party campaigns can be successful with the right candidate and enough money, he said, pointing to Jesse Ventura’s election as Minnesota governor in the 1990s as a Reform Party candidate and Joseph Lieberman’s reelection to the U.S. Senate as a third-party candidate in 2006 after he lost the Connecticut Democratic primary.
And Musk, with effectively unlimited resources, could likely gather the signatures necessary to get candidates on the ballot in at least a subset of states, Beatty said. That’s because he could pay for an army of workers to gather signatures in the states where he wants to run candidates.
“At first blush, you’re like, ‘Third party, Trump or someone could say that’s crazy, it’s not going to work.’ A lot of people would say that,” Beatty said. “But when you look at his tactical approach, it’s something to take seriously.”

But for some, like The Ohio Newsroom, the mandate is statewide. Reporters use their resources to make sure Ohioans know their neighbors, along with the residents of far-off towns they may not know.
“To me, it’s really important that people in Columbus hear about what’s going on in Bucyrus, or that people in Cleveland hear what’s happening in Findlay,” said Clare Roth, managing editor of The Ohio Newsroom. “We’re all connected, we’re all members of this state … and I think that’s an essential service that public radio does very well.”
The Ohio Newsroom started three years ago with help from a Corporation for Public Broadcasting grant. For Roth, as well as other journalists in the state, the coverage that they do means allowing Ohioans to be able to hear themselves in the news.
“That representation matters and means something, for people to hear folks from their area on the radio and to hear stories about the places that they’re from,” Roth said.
Public media workers in Ohio are worried about an ongoing effort to claw back federal funds, including more than $1 billion for Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Funding from the CPB goes to local stations who distribute NPR and PBS, and provides grant funding for projects and local programming.

The U.S. House already approved what’s called a rescissions bill, which Republican leadership and the Trump administration has said is cost-cutting measure, this time for about $9 billion in reductions to foreign aid, along with public media on the homefront. It’s now in the hands of the U.S. Senate, facing a July 18 deadline.
 Repercussions
Many public media outlets in Ohio have enlisted the help of their supporters, listeners, and readers to reach out to their federal representatives and senators and urge push back against the bill.
“I just really believe that public media needs to belong to the public and should be accountable to the public,” said Kevin Martin, president and CEO of Ideastream Public Media.
The station actually contains many stations, including the WKSU for NPR and local coverage, PBS station WVIZ.

Ideastream is also helps provides livestreams of legislative sessions, committee meetings, press conferences and even the Ohio Supreme Court’s oral arguments through The Ohio Channel.
Martin has memories of similar attempts to cut federal public media funding, having worked as a distributor of community service grants for the CPB himself.
“I can not remember a Republican president that hasn’t had public media zeroed out in their budget,” Martin said.
But the bipartisan support for public media has always won the day. With the new administration, however, Martin and other Ohio public media leaders are seeing a different environment.
“Every member of Congress, when they vote, it’s a calculation, and I would say nowadays it’s about the repercussions of their vote,” Martin said.
Local media could see its own repercussions with the budget cuts as they stand, cuts that could not only impact the amount of content the stations can produce, but also their ability to provide things like emergency alerts.
“There’s a very well-established infrastructure for emergency alerts that are made possible through public media,” said Luke Dennis, general manager of WYSO in Yellow Springs. “Public media is, in many places, the only media, so when the internet doesn’t work, or you can’t afford it at all, it matters to be able to have that service.”
WYSO recently established itself as an independent news station apart from Antioch College, and they’re working to grow on their own. The station was able to raise about $3.5 million in about nine months “because the community got excited about WYSO being independent,” according to Dennis.
But the CPB cuts could mean a loss of about $300,000 for WYSO.

“It will force us to quickly adapt and approve the plan b budget that we have in our back pocket, and we don’t want to do that because we’re already working lean and mean,” Dennis said.
The message from public media leaders to listeners and to lawmakers is unified: the work they do serves their hyper-local community, and national services like PBS make a difference.
“I often ask people if they grew up watching Sesame Street or Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood, because that reminds us that education is a core tenet of public media,” Dennis said.
Dennis and Martin said supporters are sending emails and making phone calls by the thousands in support of public media.
Martin said Ideastream would “probably need some consolidation” if the cuts are made, but he and Roth both see the problem at a higher level than station-to-station cuts.
“I worry about the system as a whole,” Roth said. “I know what a different it can make to tell stories and to really get to the richness of Ohio life, and I hate to think of that being curtailed anywhere.”
 Ohio’s congressional delegation
All of Ohio’s U.S. House Democrats voted against the cuts, with the exception of Rep. Joyce Beatty, who was absent from the vote for medical reasons.
Beatty told the Capital Journal in a statement that she strongly opposes the legislation and urged her colleagues “to keep public radio and public broadcast well-funded, free and accessible.”
Only one of Ohio’s Republican House members, Rep. Mike Turner, voted against the rescissions bill.
Turner did not respond to the Capital Journal’s request for comment, but Democratic representatives were universal in their support for public media in Ohio, particularly it’s ability to give access to rural and low-income areas.
“For families who can’t afford access to paid cable or streaming options, easy access to unbiased local media that keeps them well-informed is a vital lifeline that is helping to educate future generations,” according to Rep. Marcy Kaptur.
Kaptur also said “cancelling Elmo won’t fix the cost-of-living crisis,” and Rep. Shontel Brown said the bill isn’t about saving money, as Republican leaders claim.

“Public broadcasting is a tiny sliver of the federal budget, and for decades, the American people have received a terrific return on this investment,” Brown said in a statement. “The fact is, if we don’t invest in educational programming for children, there is no guarantee that the commercial media will.”
Rep. Emilia Sykes said the proposed cuts “would have a massively negative impact” on her district, and cutting the funding to local stations “will be a disservice to our communities, as well as those across the country that aren’t part of bigger media markets.”
Lawmakers who responded to questions about their votes on the bill emphasized the public interest the threat to public media funding has garnered.
“We’ve gotten calls from so many constituents who say this is a really big deal to them,” said Rep. Greg Landsman, in a statement. “Cutting over a billion dollars would hit small communities, and we know these are good programs that serve real people.”
GOP Rep. Warren Davidson declined to comment for the story, but posted screenshots of NPR headlines on racism and gender inequality, along with a PBS headline on implicit bias and a headline from an unnamed media source mentioning NPR’s use of audio from an abortion in a news report to his official X account on June 12.
“This type of ‘coverage’ shouldn’t get a cent of taxpayer dollars,” Davidson’s post read. “Defund NPR and PBS.”
The Capital Journal did not receive responses from the other Ohio members who voted to approve the cuts: U.S. Reps. David Taylor, Troy Balderson, Bob Latta, Jim Jordan, David Joyce, Mike Carey and Max Miller.
In a video posted to his official X account, Miller spoke proudly of the cuts, though he didn’t specifically mention the CPB funds. He said the rescissions bill reductions “root out waste, fraud and abuse of taxpayer dollars.”
“These are codifying (Department of Government Efficiency) cuts that don’t advance American interests,” Miller said.
The U.S. Senate has until mid-July to vote on the measure, or the rescissions bill will expire, and the funding will be sent to the entities as previously planned.
A spokesperson for Ohio Republican U.S. Sen. Bernie Moreno said the congressman already plans to vote for the cuts.
“It is a blatant waste of American taxpayer dollars that Senator Moreno looks forward to putting an end to immediately,” said spokesperson Reagan McCarthy.
Republican U.S. Sen. Jon Husted did not respond to request for comment.

Stock photo from Getty Images.It’s hardly news that local coverage in Ohio’s cities and towns isn’t what it once was. A new analysis shows that it’s been devastated in most small towns, suburbs and cities in the United States. 
The results have implications for the future of democracy and could be useful to those who want to fix the problem.
The analysis was released on Thursday after a collaboration between the media software company Muck Rack and Rebuild Local News, a nonprofit coalition that seeks to revitalize local journalism. It chugged data and determined that when counted on a per-capita basis, the United States has lost a stunning 75% of its local journalists since 2002.
“To put that statistic in perspective, that means that if you live in a county of 10,000 people, there wouldn’t be even one full-time reporter to cover all of the schools, the town councils, the economic development projects, basketball games, environmental decisions, local businesses, and local events,” the report said. “There are 97,000 cities, towns, counties and other units of government. This report shows that there are the equivalent 27,000 local journalists. Most governments, most neighborhoods, and most residents are being covered poorly or not at all.”
One result of such a loss of coverage is the potential for public corruption. Very often it’s the local press that blows the whistle when a county commissioner uses the highway department to pave his driveway, or a sheriff uses official resources against political opponents.
SUPPORT: YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE
Another consequence is that without the press looking on, local government is able to act in virtual secret, making huge decisions without input from the community whose money it’s spending.
To determine relative losses in the press corps, the team came up with the concept of “local journalist equivalents.” 
Muck Rack aggregated county-level reporting across all 3,141 U.S. counties. It identified online bylines for news and sports reporters, photographers, part-timers and freelancers. Reporters with print, online and broadcast outlets were all included.
It identified journalists who are “are responsible for the consistent production and/or distribution of newsworthy content” and it assessed who of them mostly produced local content. Muck Rack also came up with a way to allocate journalists who were based in big cities, but covered local topics in surrounding suburban counties.
The analysis then compared those numbers to a set from 2002 developed by David H. Weaver and a team at Indiana University and came up with a 75% decline in journalists covering local news. 
The numbers fell from 40 such reporters per 100,000 residents in 2002 to 8.2 today.
At 7.9 local journalists per 100,000 residents, Ohio ranks 31st among states.
“The basic finding is that it’s even more widespread and severe than we thought,” said Steven Waldman, founder and president of Rebuild Local News.
And the losses haven’t only hammered rural communities.
“When you look at the drop in reporters per population, you see in really vivid terms the effect of the gutting of newsrooms in the suburbs and cities,” Waldman said. 
That said, many of the Appalachian counties in Southeast Ohio showed some of the most dismal numbers. But one had the best.
With just 0.1 local reporter per 100,000 people, Gallia County ranks 86th out of Ohio’s 88 counties and 2,962nd out of 3,124 in the U.S.
But Athens County is just 42 miles away and it ranks the best in Ohio, with 76 local reporters per 100,000 people. That makes it the 23rd best-covered county in the U.S.
The report pointed to a likely explanation.
“There are some oddities,” it said, unsurprisingly, of Athens County. “For example, the Ohio county with the most local journalists per resident is Athens County, but it is helped by the presence of Ohio University. That’s the case for a few other counties with big universities, such as Albemarle County, home of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville. Those two universities have great student journalists who show up in strong numbers in the Muck Rack data and therefore in this report.”
The report also acknowledged possible shortcomings in the analysis.
“The data doesn’t show the same phenomenon in every county that’s home to a robust student news outlet, probably for reasons related to the content management system, byline policy or other factors,” it said.

(Getty Images)Maine lawmakers postponed action on reforming the state’s troubled child welfare system, this time on a proposal modeled after New Hampshire’s independent child advocate — a program some see as a blueprint to provide oversight and address systemic issues.
There have been many proposals to reform the system in recent years, but some feel that looking to New Hampshire for its Office of the Child Advocate could offer the most promising solution.
Assistant House Majority Leader Lori Gramlich (D-Old Orchard Beach) introduced LD 1893 in early May. The bill would transfer Maine’s existing child welfare ombudsman into a new, independent agency with expanding responsibilities to advocate for Maine children.
Although the Legislature adjourned in late June, the Health and Human Services Committee decided to hold onto the bill until next session, which is slated to begin in January.
The Department of Health and Human Services, which houses the state’s child welfare agency the Office of Child and Family Services, said at the public hearing that it would also like more time to consider the proposal because of the “extensive reach” it could have throughout state government.
The proposed Office of Child Advocate would have the authority to receive complaints, access information, investigate, make public reports, and advise the executive and legislative branches on how best to provide services to the state’s youth beyond just child welfare. This could extend to the Departments of Education, Corrections, or any other agency providing services to or arranging services on behalf of a child.
Moira O’Neill, who helped craft the model in New Hampshire and served as its first child advocate before stepping down in 2021, told Maine Morning Star that the language in LD 1893 is far better compared to the first iteration of New Hampshire’s law. She also pointed out that the legislation proposes the essential components of ombudsman work: independence, impartiality, access to information, and confidentiality.
As O’Neill sees it, children and their interests don’t have a seat at the table under Maine’s current child welfare infrastructure. She pointed out that there are children in Maine who are hungry, abused, neglected, and will be saddled with long-term effects to their health, employment and relationships.
“They need someone who is just for them — not a part time cabinet, not a caring governor, not a legislative committee — but one person whose only job is to hear children, know their best interest, and speak on their behalf,” she said. “It must be an independent someone who is beholden only to the children and the statute.
Though the department spoke neither for nor against LD 1893, it said it is interested in exploring the model as a way to strengthen oversight. It also acknowledged that there are already multiple avenues for oversight including federal regulations, legislative oversight and citizen advisory panels.
Oversight and root causes
After renewed scrutiny in recent years, there have been multiple attempts to restructure the state’s child welfare system. This has included multiple failed legislative attempts, including just last year, to separate the OCFS from DHHS.
Last year, OCFS frontline workers came forward with accounts of onerous workloads that culminated in December with a letter of no confidence in the agency’s leadership.
The bill language presents a shift from policing to promoting better practices, including for state agencies, O’Neill explained.
“You can’t prosecute and fire your way through a system weakness,” she said. “When systems are weak due to lack of funding, work force, training, effective policy, etc., the best solution generally comes from collaborative efforts that enhance support for systems and repairs weaknesses.”
Melissa Hackett, coordinator of the Maine Child Welfare Action Network, said she prefers the proposed Office of Child Advocate model because it does not solely focus on the child welfare system.
“This office taking that bigger picture view felt more promising to me than some of the other proposals that have really, in my opinion … felt reactionary,” Hackett said.
She appreciates that the Office of Child Advocate would build upon the oversight provided by the existing child welfare ombudsman office, while having the ability to explore the root causes that could lead a family to being involved with the system.
That could create what Hackett described as a “both-and” approach to provide oversight and address the systemic factors like substance use disorder or mental health that can bring a family in contact with the child welfare system. But she said that will require public and political will to understand what is really happening with children and families.
Hackett said the proposed child advocate would be able “to really look up from a high level down at what’s happening on the ground to see these trends and to not be singularly focused on one incident or case but to be able to look across those trends to say, ‘This is what we need to really address and this is how we address it to stem the flow of these kids coming into these systems.’”
Confidentiality in child welfare
The Office of Child Advocate could also provide a solution for the ways confidentiality complicates child welfare oversight.
In August 2022, the Legislature’s Government Oversight Committee asked DHHS to view records relating to the 2021 deaths of four children. The department denied the committee access, citing confidentiality laws.
After that denial, the committee filed an action in the Kennebec County Superior Court urging the department to comply with its subpoena. The court denied the committee’s request, ruling that it did not have the authority to access the confidential records.
The committee appealed the decision to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, which held a hearing in December 2023 before ruling in line with the lower court decision.
Because of that decision from the state’s highest court, Sen. Craig Hickman (D-Kennebec) put in a bill last session seeking to allow the committee to access “privileged and confidential” records while keeping them exempt from public disclosure. That proposal was also carried over by the Judiciary Committee to be worked on further next session.
O’Neill said the independent child advocate role outlined in LD 1893 is a better solution than opening up legislator access to that sort of confidential information. That person wouldn’t be influenced by partisan priorities and can serve as a “resource for children and families navigating seemingly unfriendly systems,” she added.

(Haines Eason)When I first moved to Lawrence more than six years ago, my wife and I settled into a neighborhood near Haskell Indian Nations University. I still remember arriving in town and being surprised and excited to see there was “another” university in town. I’d taken a job in communications at the University of Kansas and used to be a teacher, so my interest was piqued. 
At the time, I had no idea there was a federally supported university system created specifically for Native American students. 
Of course. I had the luxury of ignorance. 
But the more I learned about Haskell and the Native peoples whose histories are embedded in this region (and our nation), the more connected I felt to my new hometown. To me, the presence of Haskell in Lawrence boded well — I must have arrived in some progressive paradise, a place where inclusivity was a lived value.
I grew up just outside of Charlottesville, Virginia, and my mother was a fourth grade teacher for decades in two counties adjacent to ours. Given what I know of my mom’s curriculum and my own educational experiences in Virginia, I have to assume that across most of the nation, Native history as taught is largely place names and sanitized Thanksgiving myths. 
Looking back, I don’t remember batting an eye at the fact that, in all the years between kindergarten and 12th grade, I learned little about “colonial America” and next to nothing about Native history. What I did learn was not about colonization. Instead, here and there I encountered tidy, comfortable narratives mostly about settlers travelling across what was implied to be a virginal and largely empty landscape. These were sprinkled as readings in non-history courses — mostly in my English classes.
Recently, a dear friend sent me Tommy Orange’s novel “There There,” and suddenly all the chaos surrounding Haskell the last few years — and some of the current political chaos — tumbled into place for me.
Early in the novel, one of Orange’s characters, Dene Oxendene, unpacks the book’s title — or at least one of its meanings. 
Set in and around Oakland, California, the titular phrase “There There” is an often misquoted reference to former Oakland resident Gertrude Stein. 
At least according to the character, Stein grew up there and returned later in life, only to lament on reacquaintance that the “there” she remembered from her youth was no longer there — lost in a sea of development and urbanization.

Neglect is a decision
Early in my time in Lawrence, I was drawn to Haskell’s grounds. On the one hand, the institution is a time capsule. On the other, it’s a living and breathing college campus that is right in front of us Lawrencians but yet so fully on its own — save for the outreach of a few community members — that it may as well, from the white world in general, be on the moon.
There’s so much contrast on the campus: The decaying football stadium, with its mismatched bleachers, plywood-boarded bathrooms and concession area entrances and towering field lights. That such a large stadium sits empty is more than sad — it seems like a plot.
Then there’s the burial ground.
Tucked behind the campus, it’s well-maintained and expensively fenced, with a picket choice that evokes fencing you sometimes see at military installations. 
Inside the fencing are markers for the 100-plus students who died during Haskell’s boarding school era — a time when Haskell was part of a school network designed to erase Native identity under the guise of civilizing. 
Now, let’s pause. 
How could intentions be noble when considering the institution’s first months? Upon its opening in late 1884, Native students endured extreme weather — drenching rains, freezing cold, then sudden warmth — all while living in unfinished, unheated buildings lacking proper plumbing and while being provided what amounted to a starvation diet. 
Pneumonia and lung ailments spread quickly, and by winter’s end, 10 students had died. Over the next five years, crop failures, fires and continued government underfunding worsened conditions. By 1913, more than 100 children had been buried on campus.
Today, the federal government’s Bureau of Indian Education still has its arms around Haskell’s operations. True self-governance — long promised — remains elusive. And dysfunction has festered.
The school’s student-run paper’s staff have faced intimidation and administrative blowback over reporting on school scandals, which include mishandled sexual assault allegations and theft. Such troubles are not so surprising when one considers the institution has had eight leaders in seven years. 
Add to all this recent mass layoffs and subsequent partial rehiring of staff that have occurred as part of the DOGE budget purge.
And now, there comes word that Haskell faces as much as a 90% budget cut. A new federal budget proposal would reduce funding for Haskell and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute in New Mexico, both managed by the BIE, from $182 million to just $22 million next year. 
These are not isolated incidents, and a direct line can be drawn from Haskell’s beginnings to these budget “conversations.”  
We know the current administration’s campaign slogan. It doesn’t deserve any more oxygen. 
But with it in mind, I’ll posit that the greatness of a nation is measured by how it treats its most vulnerable — and how it keeps its promises. So I ask: Can you name a single treaty with Native Americans that the United States has honored or that has served Native Americans well?
 
  The football stadium at Haskell Indian Nations University in Lawrence. (Haines Eason)
Is progressivism really progressive? 
My most personal connection to Native life — a connection I’ll forever treasure — came through a woman I’ll call Abigail. She passed in 2023, and in honor of what I’ve learned about Native traditions, I won’t speak or write her tribal name now.
Abigail was one of the most resilient, wise and clear-eyed people I’ve ever known. And even though I am sure she would be heartbroken by what’s happening at Haskell, I imagine she’d also laugh. Not because it’s funny — but because it doesn’t have anything to do with Natives.
In my heart I believe she would say that what is happening at Haskell, and what has always happened between white and Native people, is really about white people’s problems. Our insecurity, inadequacy and insatiability.
Haskell’s troubles are not Native-created. The troubles challenging many reservations are not Native-created. 
What’s happening at Haskell is an American problem. Don’t be fooled: There is so much abundance in this nation. So much food, land, wealth and more. But the hoarding by those at the top turns the rest of us on each other. Haskell and all native institutions of learning could be well funded with little effort. Health and hunger issues on Native lands — really across all communities — could be solved with straightforward tax adjustments. 
Never forget that the taxation of the rich and redeployment of that capital in the post-WWII years created the most robust economy the world has ever seen.
So, Lawrence. Is it really a progressive paradise? I think the better question is: Are progressives really progressive? Do they have more than platitudes to offer? Or white tears? 
White Americans, myself included, have lived in a simulacrum that is finally fraying at the seams. 
It’s time we feel just a fraction of what our Black and Native neighbors have endured for centuries. 
Maybe then we’ll finally understand that survival isn’t the same as justice.

(Photo by Alex Brandon - Pool/Getty Images)In 2019, I attended my first meeting of the Society for Benefit-Cost Analysis in Washington, D.C. The keynote speaker was Cass Sunstein, one of the most prominent public advocates for the use of benefit-cost analysis and former administrator for the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs under President Obama.
His keynote was on a phenomenon he called “sludge.” This was the phenomenon of how much time costs are exacted by the government on individuals through paperwork. 
His idea was that time that people spent on filling out government paperwork is time they could be spending working, resting, with their families, or any of the other ways people spend their time. Therefore, we should consider the time people spend on regulatory compliance as a cost to society.
As policymakers at the federal level passed the “Big Beautiful Bill,” they ushered in a new moment in the history of sludge: the moment sludge was used to try to discourage people from getting health insurance.
According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the Big Beautiful Bill creates new requirements for verifying addresses, cross-checking eligibility and data against other sources, and reduces retroactive coverage from three months to one month. It also imposes work requirements, puts penalties in place for covering immigrants, and makes renewing Medicaid more time-consuming and onerous.
The goal of these changes is to reduce enrollment in Medicaid.
In Ohio, the Center for Community Solutions said in an analysis that enrollment loss could be as high as 450,000 people.
The federal government is not alone in working to create sludge in the Medicaid program. For years, policymakers have been working to exact work requirements on Medicaid recipients.
The problem with this approach is that work requirements don’t work. 
When work requirements for Medicaid enrollment were put in place in Arkansas during the first Trump Administration, most of the people who lost their health insurance were people who were working but did not know how to comply with the new requirements for reporting that had been put in place.
When policymakers at the federal level were working to reform the welfare state, they reduced spending by turning entitlement programs into block grant programs, allocating only a certain amount of money to each state and requiring them to manage that money. 
While many would argue this was not good policy (it certainly turned America’s most important cash assistance program into a shell of itself), it was at least not so cynical of a policy as to throw sand into the cogs of the state then complain about it not working.
Part of the reason for the different strategy is because Medicaid is popular. Of the 50 states, 40 have adopted Medicaid expansion. A majority of the states that have adopted Medicaid expansion voted for Trump in 2024. 
Out-and-out cutting Medicaid would be unpopular among the constituents of legislators. So instead, they turned to rules that seem reasonable on their face — like eligibility verification and work requirements — that in reality just make the system more complicated and push people off health insurance.
Policymaking predicated on deceiving the public is cynical. 
Creating red tape on programs you don’t like removes any moral high ground you have to complain about government inefficiency. 
If you don’t believe in government working, I don’t really know why you want to spend your career working in it.

A new analysis warns that jobs held by both immigrants and US-born workers are at risk.
President Donald Trump’s deportation plans could cost nearly 6 million jobs, according to an analysis released Thursday.
If successful, Trump’s goal of deporting 4 million people over four years will cost jobs held by both immigrants and U.S.-born workers, according to the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute.
EPI’s analysis found California, Florida, New York and Texas will have the highest number of job losses, because of larger immigrant populations in those states.
The construction industry will see the biggest drop in employment, with an estimated 861,000 U.S.-born and 1.4 million immigrant jobs lost, according to the analysis. The child care sector is expected to lose half a million jobs.
Immigrants are a crucial component of the American economy, representing nearly 20% of the nation’s workforce last year, according to federal data.
If Trump wants more deportations, he’ll need to target the construction industry

Because jobs held by U.S.-born and immigrant workers are often complementary and economically linked, the shrinking supply of immigrant labor can adversely affect employer demand for jobs held by both groups of workers, the Economic Policy Institute report said.
Immigrant workers are also consumers, meaning that group will spend less in local economies as their earnings and employment decline.
“Regardless of the exact mechanisms, deportations can cause a sharp and abrupt enough fall in labor supply that some employers will respond by shutting down operations entirely,” the analysis said.
The major spending and tax bill Trump signed July 4 allocated $170 billion for immigration enforcement and border protection measures. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Immigration and Customs Enforcement would be the highest-funded law enforcement agency in the country, at nearly $30 billion through September 2029.
Already, the number of jobs being performed by foreign-born workers is declining, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
And those losses are not leading to more U.S.-born workers in the workforce, labor economist Mark Regets, a senior fellow at the National Foundation for American Policy, told Forbes this week.
That contradicts Republican claims, said Ben Zipperer, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute.
“While Trump and other conservatives claim that increased deportations will somehow magically create jobs for U.S.-born workers, the existing evidence shows that the opposite is true: they will cause immense harm to workers and families, shrink the economy, and weaken the labor market for everyone,” Zipperer said in a Thursday news release.

(Photo by Gary Stone, Nebraska Extension/Courtesy of University of Nebraska-Lincoln)Tariffs, deportations threaten economic damage in the still-thriving Southeast United States.
Global clashes and trade wars hammered Midwestern states’ agricultural economies early this year, while a continuing boom in Southeastern states’ housing and tech jobs kept their economies humming along.
Some Southeastern states were seeing a strong agricultural economy because of still-rising poultry and egg prices, though small row-crop farmers there were still caught in the crunch of high costs and low profits, and many declared bankruptcy. And the area benefited from gains in real estate and tech.
Overall, 39 states and the District of Columbia saw drops in gross domestic product (GDP) for the first quarter of this year — well above the 22 states and the District of Columbia seeing drops during the same time in 2024, according to a Stateline analysis of preliminary U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis statistics released June 27.
National numbers released late last month show a rare decrease in economic output for the first quarter, the first since 2022, partly because of increased imports as suppliers sought to stock up on imported goods ahead of tariff increases. GDP is calculated by subtracting imported goods from national economic output.
There’s widespread agreement that row-crop farmers are suffering economic pain, especially in the Midwest where the industry dominates the economy. Meanwhile, the booming housing and tech sectors in the South are on a continued winning streak even as storm clouds gather over tariffs and immigrant labor.
Nationwide, more farms filed for Chapter 12 bankruptcy from January through March than in any full year since 2021, driven by higher costs for supplies and lower prices paid for row crops such as corn, soybeans and wheat.
“Crop prices and commodity prices are significantly lower, and fertilizer and equipment prices are higher, so we’re seeing a bit of a struggle right now in the farm economy,” said Abygail Streff, an economist and policy analyst at the Nebraska Farm Bureau.
Meat prices are one of the few bright spots in Nebraska’s farm economy, Streff said. “For a lot of producers who have cattle, this has been a really good year for them.”
Still, Nebraska, along with Iowa, suffered the biggest drop in GDP, according to the analysis. Each state fell 6.1% from the same time a year ago.
States face hard choices as budgets expected to tighten

The squeeze on farmers from high fertilizer prices and low grain prices means they must produce more and more corn just to pay their fertilizer costs, said Josh Linville, a fertilizer market analyst at StoneX.
Fertilizer supply has been disrupted by sanctions against Russia, and it’s gotten worse this year with the bombing of Iran and the trade war with China, two countries that are also important fertilizer suppliers to American farmers, Linville said.
“We tend to think of the Middle East and the Strait of Hormuz [a shipping channel under threat by conflict] from an oil-slash-energy perspective, but 1 out of every 2 tons of urea fertilizer that gets shipped to the United States comes from the Middle East,” Linville said.
Despite being a drain in the Midwest, agriculture was a positive driver of economies in Alabama, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to Stateline’s analysis.
That’s because Southeastern agriculture includes more poultry and eggs, currently more profitable than the row crops that dominate in the Midwest, said Wendiam Sawadgo, an extension economist at Auburn University. The divergence is expected to last, he said, with row-crop prices continuing to fall and meat and egg prices continuing to rise this year.
But even in the Southeast, row-crop farmers suffered.
Billions of dollars at stake for farmers hit by Trump funding freeze, pause on foreign aid

Arkansas saw a near-record number of farm bankruptcies this year, for example. And climate change has contributed to lower soybean prices as low water levels in the Mississippi River make barge transportation more difficult and expensive, according to reports this year by the University of Arkansas’ Agricultural Economics & Agribusiness Department.
Farm bankruptcies nationally came to 259 in the first three months of this year. That was more than any full year since 2021, when there were 276, according to cases compiled by Ryan Loy, an agricultural economist at the University of Arkansas. Arkansas saw 15 farm bankruptcies in the first quarter, almost as many as in all of 2024, when there were 16.
“We’ve already outpaced all of last year on a national scale,” he said.
Large farms can ride out struggles, but smaller farms are more likely to go bankrupt from increases in costs and lower market prices, a pattern that started in the early 2010s and got sharply worse in the past year, Loy said.
All five of the states with the fastest-growing economies were in the 12-state Southeast region defined by the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even there, though, the percentages were slight: South Carolina (up 1.7%), Florida (up 1.4%), Alabama (up 1%), North Carolina and Arkansas (each up .8%) had the largest increases in the nation.
USDA cuts hit small farms as Trump showers billions on big farms

The largest drivers in Florida, North Carolina and South Carolina were real estate and tech, while increases in Alabama and Arkansas were mostly in agriculture.
The Carolinas have been magnets for new movers, said Matthew Martin, a Charlotte, North Carolina-based regional executive for the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. The influx has driven more housing and infrastructure work to supply newcomers, he said.
“Employment in South Carolina is on fire right now and North Carolina is doing well also. They’re places that people want to be,” Martin said. “Employers want to be there, too, and so there’s been population growth. Then you’ve got to have all the retail and health care. That has got to follow it.”
Business owners are uncertain about future federal policy in the Trump administration, Martin said, according to conversations he’s had.
They worry about tariffs, whether they’ll have to raise prices or accept lower profits, and eventually whether those factors could cause job growth to stall. And some businesses that depend on immigrant labor say they’ve lost workers despite using the national E-Verify system to make sure employees have legal status to work, Martin said.
Martin hasn’t heard of many workplace raids in the Carolinas, but there have been some federal audits of employee forms to check for false statements.
“Some of the workers won’t show up from that day forward,” Martin said.

Nebraskans know a mighty wind. We know whirling monsters tethered to a blackened firmament while wreaking havoc on fields and towns and lives. 
Tornadoes are a fact of life here from March to the dog days of summer. When one touches us in some way — from death to destruction to simple awe — we ask how we can better keep ourselves safe. 
When we ask such things, we are anything but “losers.”
“Losers” is what Texas Gov. Greg Abbott called those who might question the response to the deadly floods that inundated central Texas on Independence Day. Specifically he said it to a reporter who had asked if there was to be an inquiry into what some officials have acknowledged could have been missteps during the unprecedented rise in the Guadalupe River. Over 120 deaths and more than 160 missing have been reported as of this writing.

“That’s the word choice of losers,” Abbott said, part of a wholly inappropriate metaphor about football champions. Parents of little girls at church camp or families and friends of anyone swept away are anything but losers for wondering what went wrong and if any human decision or lack thereof contributed. 
Even without factoring in the DOGE cutbacks at NOAA and FEMA’s three-day delay to respond, the question is reasonable for loved ones … and reporters. Abbott chose name-calling over leadership.
Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, coming off a victory lap for cutting health care benefits to millions and taking food from hungry kids, was even less helpful. When asked on a television news program about the flood, Johnson said, “All we can do is pray.”
Seriously? I assume politics in Johnson’s home state of Louisiana works a similar way it does here in Nebraska, where elected representatives are expected to lead. That includes inquiries, asking tough questions and making changes to keep us safe where needed. 
Want to pray? Fine. But do your job. For details see that whole faith without works thing.
Big Ugly bill?
Lost under the garish light of the Big Ugly, signed into law on July 4, was the U.S. Department of Education’s announcement the day before to withhold $6.2 billion already promised to the nation’s public schools. Nebraska’s share of that money checks in at about $40 million. 
The DOE, now apparently a federal agency in name only, said it was pausing the disbursements for further review even though Congress passed and the president signed the bill in March. Funds were to be allocated on July 1.
According to the Economic Policy Institute, money in “targeted districts” would be used to support “before and after school programs ($1.4 billion), English language learning ($890 million), migrant education ($375 million), academic enrichment ($1.3 billion) and professional development of staff and teachers ($2.2 billion).”
While that lineup stretches across a variety of areas in need of help, the specter of the administration’s obsession with immigration and preoccupation with DEI initiatives underscores its interest in at least a third of the money.
Obviously, Nebraska school districts, many of whom have already drawn up contingencies, will take a sizable hit. Worse, however, could be any further stopping and starting, making for nightmarish budgeting processes. 
For comparison sake on the detritus left from the administration’s proclivity for teeter-totter economic policies, read no further than the current stop/start story of the nation’s tariff conundrum.
The Fourteenth Amendment
Finally, last Wednesday, July 9, we marked 157 years of living with the Fourteenth Amendment, the first line of which has as much relevance today as it did in 1868. That’s because while the current administration is playing fast and loose with the amendment’s due process requirement, what we call birthright citizenship is also being challenged. 
The amendment has five sections, the first of which contains the two lines referenced above: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.”
Section 5 says “The Congress shall have power to enforce, by appropriate legislation, the provisions of this article.” Hmm? A joint session for a Fourteenth Amendment reading? Better yet, how about Congress using its power to insist we follow it?
Whatever … 157 years is something to celebrate.

Consider first this simple question: Why do local Democrats relentlessly press local Republican officials to condemn President Trump’s policies, irrelevant to town governance, while Greenwich Democratic Reps. Hector Arzeno and Steve Meskers escape scrutiny for harmful legislation from Hartford that directly affects our quality of life?
I’m referring to Hartford House Bill 5002, misleadingly titled “An Act Concerning Housing and the Needs of Homeless Persons.”  In reality, the bill became a brazen state power grab, stripping Connecticut municipalities of their sovereignty through “fair share” housing quotas and mandated transit-oriented development.
Reps. Arzeno and Meskers did vote “no” on HB 5002, a calculated move likely permitted by their party’s supermajority to shield them in swing districts like Greenwich. More than a few Fairfield County Democrats also voted “no,” hinting at a coordinated strategy to protect vulnerable representatives while advancing Hartford’s agenda unchallenged.
Beyond their hollow votes, they also failed to support key amendments that could have mitigated the bill’s impact. These amendments would have allowed accessory apartments to be included as affordable housing units and would have exempted municipalities from submitting housing plans if they met the 10% threshold of affordable housing units under 8-30g “Affordable Housing Land Use Appeals Procedure.” 
The amendments were tailored to protect zoning autonomy.  The other proposed amendments were attempts to extend tight time frames, protect rural areas and watersheds (drainage basins), reduce administrative costs and regulatory reporting burdens.  They also sought to eliminate “as of right” development (translation: towns having no say in their development) and soften penalties for non-compliance. 
Arzeno and Meskers repeatedly pledged to defend local zoning on the campaign trail. Yet, there’s no evidence of their advocacy —no speeches, no votes for protective amendments, no effort to safeguard Greenwich’s independence. Their silence stands in stark contrast to Sen. Ryan Fazio who backed Senate Schedule A which made transit-oriented development voluntary, freeing towns from state pressure to rezone near train stations for high-density housing.  State Rep. Tina Courpas also spoke out vigorously against the state overreach regarding the sovereignty of Greenwich’s zoning.
If Meskers expressed concerns about HB 5002’s scope, why didn’t he or Arzeno support the amendments to curb the bill’s ambitions? Their inaction betrayed their loyalty to Hartford’s party bosses over Greenwich’s residents.  
Meskers praised the previous legislative session’s “Work, Live, Ride” bill, which he and Arzeno backed after securing minor “local-friendly” amendments only for it to fail in the Senate thanks to Sen. Fazio’s filibuster. Their selective engagement raises a critical question: Why didn’t they fight for Greenwich’s zoning rights on HB 5002?  Why did Meskers and Arzeno vote for the strike-all bill amendments (A and B), which paved the way from a bill with a narrow focus on homelessness to an omnibus housing reform?
Greenwich deserves political leaders who don’t hide behind token “no” votes but fiercely defend our zoning autonomy at every turn.  The only Greenwich Democrat to take a stand was Gov. Ned Lamont, a Greenwich resident, who vetoed this undemocratic overreach. 
Arzeno and Meskers had clear opportunities to back corrective amendments as  Courpas and Fazio did, but they chose silence. They endlessly boast about having ‘a seat at the table’ as majority Democrats, but they never use their influence to challenge their party’s harmful policies like HB 5002.  Their inaction was tantamount to consent to Hartford’s mandates, prioritizing party loyalty over Greenwich’s interests. 
Our town’s future depends on representatives who prioritize Greenwich’s right to local control over its affairs rather than party ideology and the special interests of developers of every stripe. Lincoln’s timeless warning to public servants about fooling all the people all the time is standing the test of time in Greenwich. 
These political antics no longer fool some of the people for even a moment.

,Connecticut Mirror,2025-07-14 04:01:00+00:00,CT Mirror,Bridging CT’s rail funding gap,Lou Rinaldi,,,,,https://ctmirror.org/2025/07/14/bridging-connecticuts-rail-funding-gap-policy-options-targeting-high-income-earners-lou/,Here are several progressive ways to close the CT rail services system's $11 million budget shortfall.,"A looming 10% fare hike for CT Rail and Metro-North commuters has highlighted an $11 million budget shortfall for the state’s rail services in the upcoming fiscal year. 
The Connecticut Department of Transportation, which requested $327 million but received $316 million from the legislature, is moving forward with the fare increase to cover rising operational costs. This has sparked a debate on alternative funding mechanisms, with a particular focus on whether the state’s wealthiest residents should contribute more to support public transportation.
The following report outlines several policy options for bridging this funding gap through progressive taxation, ensuring the long-term solvency and affordability of Connecticut’s vital rail network.
The current landscape: A progressive system with room for adjustment
Connecticut already has a progressive tax system. The state income tax features seven brackets, with the top marginal rate of 6.99% applying to income over $500,000 for single filers and $1,000,000 for those married filing jointly. Additionally, Connecticut taxes capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income and levies a 12% estate tax on estates exceeding the federal exemption ($13.61 million in 2024). The state also has a progressive real estate conveyance tax on high-value properties.
The following proposals build upon this existing framework to generate dedicated revenue for transportation.
Policy option 1: A “millionaire’s surtax” for transportation
The proposal: Following the model recently implemented in neighboring Massachusetts, Connecticut could introduce a “millionaire’s surtax.” This would be an additional tax on annual income exceeding a certain threshold, with the revenue explicitly dedicated to a transportation trust fund.
Structure: A 1% to 2% surtax could be levied on all income over $1 million, regardless of filing status. For instance, a 1.5% surtax would mean a household with $1.5 million in taxable income would pay an additional $7,500 (1.5% of $500,000).
Revenue potential: Given the concentration of high-income earners in Connecticut, even a modest surtax could generate substantial revenue, likely exceeding the current $11 million gap and providing a stable source for future investment.
Pros: This is a highly targeted approach that would only affect a small percentage of top earners. It has a successful precedent in Massachusetts, where a 4% surtax is funding transportation and education initiatives.
Cons: Opponents may argue that such a tax could incentivize high-income residents to relocate to states with lower tax burdens, a phenomenon known as “tax flight.”
Policy option 2: A surcharge on capital gains and investment income
The proposal: This option would create a dedicated surcharge on investment-related income for high earners, acknowledging that a significant portion of their wealth is derived from investments rather than wages.
Structure: A surcharge of 1% to 2% could be applied to capital gains, dividends, and interest income for individuals with a Connecticut Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) over a certain level, for example, $500,000 for single filers and $1 million for joint filers. This would be in addition to the current 6.99% top marginal rate.
Revenue potential: This would capture a growing source of income for the state’s wealthiest residents and could be a significant and consistent revenue stream for transportation projects.
Pros: This targets wealth generation directly and could be seen as more equitable than a broad-based income surtax. It would also apply to a demographic with a greater capacity to contribute.
Cons: The revenue from capital gains can be volatile and dependent on stock market performance. Critics might also contend that it discourages investment within the state.
Policy option 3: Enhancing the real estate conveyance tax on luxury properties
The proposal: This policy would increase the marginal rates of the state’s existing real estate conveyance tax, often referred to as a “mansion tax,” for the highest-value properties.
Structure: The current progressive structure could be made more so by adding new, higher tax brackets for properties sold for over, for instance, $3 million and $5 million. The additional revenue generated from these top-tier sales would be earmarked for the transportation fund.
Revenue potential: While the revenue stream would be less predictable than an income-based tax, it could provide significant injections of funding from high-value real estate transactions.
Pros: This tax is paid at the point of a major financial transaction, potentially making it more palatable than an annual income tax increase. It also directly links a source of significant wealth to a public good.
Cons: The real estate market can be cyclical, leading to fluctuations in revenue. Some may also argue that it could have a cooling effect on the luxury housing market.
Policy option 4: A dedicated transportation levy via the estate tax
The proposal: This option would involve either a marginal increase in the state’s 12% estate tax rate or the creation of a dedicated transportation “carve-out” from existing estate tax revenue.
Structure: The state could increase the estate tax rate by a small margin (e.g., to 12.5% or 13%) with the additional percentage dedicated to transportation. Alternatively, a set percentage of the total estate tax collected annually could be allocated directly to the transportation fund.
Revenue potential: Given that the tax applies to estates over $13.61 million, even a small rate increase could yield millions for transportation.
Pros: This tax is levied on the intergenerational transfer of significant wealth and would not impact the vast majority of Connecticut residents.
Cons: Estate tax revenue can be highly variable from year to year, depending on the number and value of estates being settled.
Conclusion: A question of priorities
The impending fare hikes on CT Rail and Metro-North underscore a critical choice for Connecticut: continue to place the burden of rising costs on riders or seek new, more progressive revenue streams. 
The policy options presented here offer a pathway to not only close the immediate $11 million funding gap but also to create a more resilient and equitable funding model for the state’s public transportation system for years to come. 
Each option comes with its own set of economic and political considerations, but all point toward a future where those with the greatest ability to contribute play a larger role in supporting a vital public service.
